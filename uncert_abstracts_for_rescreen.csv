FALSE,1,Forecasting the combined effects of anticipated climate change and agricultural conservation practices on fish recruitment dynamics in Lake Erie,"Many aquatic ecosystems are experiencing multiple anthropogenic stressors that threaten their ability to support ecologically and economically important fish species. Two of the most ubiquitous stressors are climate change and non-point source nutrient pollution. Agricultural conservation practices (ACPs, i.e. farming practices that reduce runoff, prevent erosion, and curb excessive nutrient loading) offer a potential means to mitigate the negative effects of non-point source pollution on fish populations. However, our understanding of how ACP implementation amidst a changing climate will affect fish production in large ecosystems that receive substantial upstream sediment and nutrient inputs remains incomplete. Towards this end, we explored how anticipated climate change and the implementation of realistic ACPs might alter the recruitment dynamics of three fish populations (native walleye Sander vitreus and yellow perch Perca flavescens and invasive white perch Morone americana) in the highly productive, dynamic west basin of Lake Erie. We projected future (2020-2065) recruitment under different combinations of anticipated climate change (n = 2 levels) and ACP implementation (n = 4 levels) in the western Lake Erie catchment using predictive biological models driven by forecasted winter severity, spring warming rate, and Maumee River total phosphorus loads that were generated from linked climate, catchment-hydrology, and agricultural-practice-simulation models. In general, our models projected reduced walleye and yellow perch recruitment whereas invasive white perch recruitment was projected to remain stable or increase relative to the recent past. Our modelling also suggests the potential for trade-offs, as ACP implementation was projected to reduce yellow perch recruitment with anticipated climate change. Overall, our study presents a useful modelling framework to forecast fish recruitment in Lake Erie and elsewhere, as well as offering projections and new avenues of research that could help resource management agencies and policy-makers develop adaptive and resilient management strategies in the face of anticipated climate and land-management change.",https://doi.org/10.1111/fwb.13515,10.1111/fwb.13515,"Dippold, David A.; Aloysius, Noel R.; Keitzer, Steven Conor; Yen, Haw; Arnold, Jeffrey G.; Daggupati, Prasad; Fraker, Michael E.; Martin, Jay F.; Robertson, Dale M.; Sowa, Scott P.; Johnson, Mari-Vaughn V.; White, Mike J.; Ludsin, Stuart A.",FRESHWATER BIOLOGY,climate warming; eutrophication; fisheries management; multiple stressors; percid,STIZOSTEDION-VITREUM-VITREUM; LAURENTIAN GREAT-LAKES; PERCH PERCA-FLAVESCENS; FRESH-WATER FISHES; EASTERN BERING-SEA; YELLOW PERCH; WHITE PERCH; RE-EUTROPHICATION; MORONE-AMERICANA; ENVIRONMENTAL-FACTORS,NA,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0046-5070,1365-2427,NA,FRESHWATER BIOL,Freshw.

FALSE,2,Projecting the effects of agricultural conservation practices on stream fish communities in a changing climate,"How anticipated climate change might affect long-term outcomes of present-day agricultural conservation practices remains a key uncertainty that could benefit water quality and biodiversity conservation planning. To explore this issue, we forecasted how the stream fish communities in the Western Lake Erie Basin (WLEB) would respond to increasing amounts of agricultural conservation practice (ACP) implementation under two IPCC future greenhouse gas emission scenarios (RCP4.5: moderate reductions; RCP8.5: business-as-usual conditions) during 2020-2065. We used output from 19 General Circulation Models to drive linked agricultural land use (APEX), watershed hydrology (SWAT), and stream fish distribution (boosted regression tree) models, subsequently analyzing how projected changes in habitat would influence fish community composition and functional trait diversity. Our models predicted both positive and negative effects of climate change and ACP implementation on WLEB stream fishes. For most species, climate and ACPs influenced species in the same direction, with climate effects outweighing those of ACP implementation. Functional trait analysis helped clarify the varied responses among species, indicating that more extreme climate change would reduce available habitat for large-bodied, cool-water species with equilibrium life-histories, many of which also are of importance to recreational fishing (e.g., northern pike, smallmouth bass). By contrast, available habitat forwarm-water, benthic species with more periodic or opportunistic life-histories (e.g., northern hogsucker, greater redhorse, greenside darter) was predicted to increase. Further, ACP implementation was projected to hasten these shifts, suggesting that efforts to improve water quality could come with costs to other ecosystem services (e.g., recreational fishing opportunities). Collectively, our findings demonstrate the need to consider biological outcomes when developing strategies to mitigate water quality impairment and highlight the value of physical-biological modeling approaches to agricultural and biological conservation planning in a changing climate.

FALSE,6,A meta-modeling approach for hydrological forecasting under uncertainty: Application to groundwater nitrate response to climate change,"We suggest a quantitative predictive approach based on meta-modeling techniques for long-term forecasting in hydrology. We apply our scalable methodological framework to a representative groundwater body in EmiliaRomagna region of Italy to evaluate the potential impact of climate change on groundwater nitrate concentration. The approach allows to (i) handle the uncertainty associated with the projection of climate variables, (ii) preserve an accurate description of flow and transport processes, and (iii) drastically accelerate computationally intensive simulations, at a time. A long-term climate scenario (i.e. referred to the 30-years 2061-2090) is developed for the study area by considering changes in the natural recharge to groundwater, the baseflow of the main rivers, and the rate of nitrate leaching. Global sensitivity analysis is performed to assess the relative influence of these factors on the quantity of interest (QoI), i.e. the long-term prediction of groundwater nitrate concentration. Our analysis enables also us to compute the spatial statistics and variability of the moments of the QoI over the study area and to perform Monte Carlo simulations to fully characterize the probabilistic behavior of the QoI at selected sensitive locations.",https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jhydrol.2021.127173,10.1016/j.jhydrol.2021.127173,"Focaccia, S.; Panini, G.; Pedrazzoli, P.; Ciriello, V",JOURNAL OF HYDROLOGY,Meta-modeling; Polynomial chaos expansion; Nitrate contamination; Climate change; Groundwater,GLOBAL SENSITIVITY-ANALYSIS; POLYNOMIAL CHAOS; FRAMEWORK; IMPACTS,NA,ELSEVIER,AMSTERDAM,"RADARWEG 29, 1043 NX AMSTERDAM, NETHERLANDS",0022-1694,1879-2707,NA,J HYDROL,J.

FALSE,7,A multi-scenario ensemble streamflow forecast method for Amu Darya River Basin under considering climate and land-use changes,"Land-use and climate changes have impacts on hydrological processes for river basin. In this study, a multi-scenario ensemble streamflow forecast (MESF) method is developed for analyzing the streamflow variation under considering climate and land-use changes, through incorporating CA-Markov model, global climate model (GCM) and Soil and Water Assessment Tool (SWAT) model within a general framework. The advantages of MESF are as follows: (i) it can simultaneously assess the impacts of land-use and climate changes on streamflow; (ii) it can obtain the possible trend and the range of future streamflows through ensemble forecast under multiple scenarios; (iii) based on analysis of streamflow processes under extreme scenarios, it can examine the effects of key factors on streamflow. The MESF method is applied to the upper reaches of the Amu Darya River Basin in Central Asia. Totally 72 scenarios, under different land-use patterns, GCMs and Representative Concentration Pathways (RCPs), are analyzed. Ensemble forecast results reveal that (i) during 2021-2050, the average annual precipitation and the average annual temperature would both increase, but the mean annual streamflow would decrease; (ii) compared to the impact of land-use change, climate change has more obvious effects on the streamflow (with contribution of 78.8%-98.7%); (iii) among all factors of land-use change, glacier melting triggered by climate warming is the most prominent factor; (iv) the peak flow in one year would have a tendency to shift from summer to spring due to the rising temperature and the speeding up snow melt.",https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jhydrol.2021.126276,10.1016/j.jhydrol.2021.126276,"Xu, Z.

FALSE,8,Forecasting water temperature in lakes and reservoirs using seasonal climate prediction,"Seasonal climate forecasts produce probabilistic predictions of meteorological variables for subsequent months. This provides a potential resource to predict the influence of seasonal climate anomalies on surface water balance in catchments and hydro-thermodynamics in related water bodies (e.g., lakes or reservoirs). Obtaining seasonal forecasts for impact variables (e.g., discharge and water temperature) requires a link between seasonal climate forecasts and impact models simulating hydrology and lake hydrodynamics and thermal regimes. However, this link remains challenging for stakeholders and the water scientific community, mainly due to the probabilistic nature of these predictions. In this paper, we introduce a feasible, robust, and open-source workflow integrating seasonal climate forecasts with hydrologic and lake models to generate seasonal forecasts of discharge and water temperature profiles. The workflow has been designed to be applicable to any catchment and associated lake or reservoir, and is optimized in this study for four catchment-lake systems to help in their proactive management. We assessed the performance of the resulting seasonal forecasts of discharge and water temperature by comparing them with hydrologic and lake (pseudo)observations (reanalysis). Precisely, we analysed the historical performance using a data sample of past forecasts and reanalysis to obtain information about the skill (performance or quality) of the seasonal forecast system to predict particular events. We used the current seasonal climate forecast system (SEAS5) and reanalysis (ERA5) of the European Centre for Medium Range Weather Forecasts (ECMWF). We found that due to the limited predictability at seasonal time-scales over the locations of the four case studies (Europe and South of Australia), seasonal forecasts exhibited none to low performance (skill) for the atmospheric variables considered. Nevertheless, seasonal forecasts for discharge present some skill in all but one case study. Moreover, seasonal forecasts for water temperature had higher performance in natural lakes than in reservoirs, which means human water control is a relevant factor affecting predictability, and the performance increases with water depth in all four case studies. Further investigation into the skillful water temperature predictions should aim to identify the extent to which performance is a consequence of thermal inertia (i.e., lead-in conditions).

FALSE,10,Enhancing Ensemble Seasonal Streamflow Forecasts in the Upper Colorado River Basin Using Multi-Model Climate Forecasts,"In the Colorado River Basin (CRB), ensemble streamflow prediction (ESP) forecasts drive operational planning models that project future reservoir system conditions. CRB operational seasonal streamflow forecasts are produced using ESP, which represents climate using an ensemble of meteorological sequences of historical temperature and precipitation, but do not typically leverage additional real-time subseasonal-to-seasonal climate forecasts. Any improvements to streamflow forecasts would help stakeholders who depend on operational projections for decision making. We explore incorporating climate forecasts into ESP through variations on an ESP trace weighting approach, focusing on Colorado River unregulated inflows forecasts to Lake Powell. The k-nearest neighbors (kNN) technique is employed using North American Multi-Model Ensemble one- and three-month temperature and precipitation forecasts, and preceding three-month historical streamflow, as weighting factors. The benefit of disaggregated climate forecast information is assessed through the comparison of two kNN weighting strategies; a basin-wide kNN uses the same ESP weights over the entire basin, and a disaggregated-basin kNN applies ESP weights separately to four subbasins. We find in general that climate-informed forecasts add greater marginal skill in late winter and early spring, and that more spatially granular disaggregated-basin use of climate forecasts slightly improves skill over the basin-wide method at most lead times.",https://doi.org/10.1111/1752-1688.12960,10.1111/1752-1688.12960,"Baker, Sarah A.; Rajagopalan, Balaji; Wood, Andrew W.",JOURNAL OF THE AMERICAN WATER RESOURCES ASSOCIATION,streamflow forecasts; trace weighting; subseasonal-to-seasonal; climate forecasts; Colorado River; NMME; reservoir inflows,PREDICTION; SKILL; COLUMBIA; MODEL; SCORE; ENSO,NA,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",1093-474X,1752-1688,NA,J AM WATER RESOUR AS,J.

FALSE,11,"Forecasting low flow conditions months in advance through teleconnection patterns, with a special focus on summer 2018","Over the past decades, Europe has been affected by several low flow periods which had substantial impacts on the hydrology of the rivers themselves as well as on the society and economy. Low flow periods have a direct impact on the environment, on the inland waterway navigation, on the hydropower production as well as on the sediment management, among others. Similar to floods, low flows are naturally occurring phenomena which can significantly hinder different uses and functions of the rivers and impact the aquatic system and the water quality. Moreover, it is projected that, in the future, climate change might lead to drier summers over the European region and therefore to more frequent and severe low flow periods. The results presented here show that the summer 2018 low flow situation, over the Rhine and Elbe Rivers basin, could have been predicted up to two seasons ahead by using previous months' sea surface temperature, sea level pressure, precipitation, mean air temperature and soil moisture. The lagged relationship between the predictand (e.g. seasonal streamflow) and the climate and oceanic predictors varies between 1 month (e.g. precipitation) up to 6 months (e.g. sea surface temperature). Taking into account that all predictors are available in real-time, the forecast scheme can be used to provide early warnings for the upcoming low flow situations, thus offering the possibility for better management of the water resources.",https://doi.org/10.1038/s41598-020-70060-8,10.1038/s41598-020-70060-8,"Ionita, M.; Nagavciuc, V",SCIENTIFIC REPORTS,NA,NORTH-ATLANTIC OSCILLATION; VARIABILITY; STREAMFLOW; DROUGHT; TEMPERATURE; CLIMATE,NA,NATURE RESEARCH,BERLIN,"HEIDELBERGER PLATZ 3, BERLIN, 14197, GERMANY",2045-2322,NA,NA,SCI REP-UK,Sci Rep,6-Aug,2020,10,1,NA,NA,13258,NA
FALSE,13,Ensemble Based Forecasting and Optimization Framework to Optimize Releases from Water Supply Reservoirs for Flood Control,"Water supply reservoir management is based on long-term management policies which depend on customer demands and seasonal hydrologic changes. However, increasing frequency and intensity of precipitation events is necessitating the short-term management of such reservoirs to reduce downstream flooding. Operational management of reservoirs at hourly/daily timescales is challenging due to the uncertainty associated with the inflow forecasts and the volumes in the reservoir. We present an ensemble-based streamflow prediction and optimization framework consisting of a regional scale hydrologic model forced with ensemble precipitation inputs to obtain probabilistic inflows to the reservoir. A multi-objective dynamic programming model was used to obtain optimized release strategies accounting for the inflow uncertainties. The proposed framework was evaluated at a water supply reservoir in the Hackensack River basin in New Jersey during Hurricanes Irene and Sandy. Hurricane Irene resulted in the overtopping of the dam despite releases made in anticipation of the event and resulted in severe downstream flooding. Hurricane Sandy was characterized by low rainfall, however, raised significant concerns of flooding given the nature of the event. The improvement in NSE for the Hurricane Irene inflows from 0.5 to 0.76 and reduction of the spread of PBIAS with decreasing lead times resulted in improvements in the forecast informed releases. This study provides perspectives on the benefits of the proposed forecasting and optimization framework in reducing the decision making burden on the operator by providing the uncertainties associated with the inflows, releases and the water levels in the reservoir.",https://doi.org/10.1007/s11269-019-02481-8,10.1007/s11269-019-02481-8,"Ramaswamy, V.; Saleh, F.",WATER RESOURCES MANAGEMENT,ECMWF; flood control; Irene; ensemble; Dynamic programming,ARTIFICIAL NEURAL-NETWORKS; OPTIMAL OPERATION; HURRICANE IRENE; CLIMATE-CHANGE; PREDICTION; INFLOW; SYSTEM; MODELS; ECMWF; MANAGEMENT,NA,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0920-4741,1573-1650,NA,WATER RESOUR MANAG,Water Resour.

FALSE,17,Predicting Lake Quality for the Next Generation: Impacts of Catchment Management and Climatic Factors in a Probabilistic Model Framework,"Lake ecosystems across the world are under combined pressures of eutrophication and climate change, which increase the risk of harmful cyanobacteria blooms, reduced ecological status, and degraded ecosystem services. In Europe, the third cycle of river basin management plans (2021-2027) according to the Water Framework Directive must take into account the potential impacts of climate change on water quality, including effects on relevant biological indicators. Here, we applied a Bayesian network as a meta-model for linking future climate and land-use scenarios for the time horizon 2050-2070, via process-based catchment and lake models, to cyanobacteria abundance and ecological status of a eutrophic lake. Building upon previous applications of the model, a new version was developed to include relevant climatic variables such as wind speed. Explorative scenarios showed that the combination of low wind and high temperature gave the most synergistic effects on cyanobacteria under high levels of eutrophication (Chl-a concentration). Considering the management target of good ecological status, however, the climate-related promotion of cyanobacteria blooms contributed most to degrading the ecological status at intermediate levels of eutrophication. Future developments of this model will aim to strengthen the link between climate variables and ecological responses, to make the model also useful for seasonal forecasting.",https://doi.org/10.3390/w11091767,10.3390/w11091767,"Moe, S.

FALSE,26,Simulating Climate Change Impacts on Surface Water Resources Within a Lake-Affected Region Using Regional Climate Projections,"This study aims to assess the impact of climate change on water resources in a large watershed within the Laurentian Great Lakes region, using the fully integrated surface-subsurface model HydroGeoSphere. The hydrologic model is forced with an ensemble of high-resolution climate projections from the Weather Research and Forecasting (WRF) model. The latter has been extended with an interactive lake model (FLake) to capture the effect of the Great Lakes on the regional climate. The WRF ensemble encompasses two different moist physics configurations at resolutions of 90, 30, and 10km, as well as four different initial and boundary conditions, so as to control for natural climate variability. The integrated hydrologic model is run with a representative seasonal cycle, which effectively controls natural climate variability, while remaining computationally tractable with a large integrated model. However, the range of natural variability is also investigated, as are the impacts of climate model resolution and bias correction. The two WRF configurations show opposite climate change responses in summer precipitation, but similar responses otherwise. The hydrologic simulations generally follow the climate forcing; however, due to the memory of the subsurface, the differences in summer propagate throughout the entire seasonal cycle. This results in a set of dry scenarios with reduced streamflow and water availability year-round and a set of wet scenarios with increased streamflow for all times excluding the spring peak, which does not increase. Most of the analysis focuses on streamflow, but changes in the seasonal cycle of baseflow and groundwater recharge are also analyzed. Plain Language Summary In this study we investigate the impact of climate change on water resources using state-of-the-art computer simulations. The simulations were conducted using physically based models, which simulate the circulation of the atmosphere, rainfall, and the flow of water above and below the surface. The region of interest here is the Grand River Watershed, located in the Great Lakes region (southern Ontario, Canada). We show that with high resolution and a physical representation of the Great Lakes, only a simple correctionmuch less than for global climate modelsis necessary, in order to simulate a realistic climate. We find that predicted climate change impacts on water resources depend strongly on some approximations commonly made to represent thunderstorms and precipitation in climate models. The most likely scenario, based on our analysis, is an increase in precipitation and streamflow in all seasons except spring, but some scenarios also show less precipitation in summer, which results in lower streamflow year-round. A major result is that differences in summer precipitation can affect streamflow in all seasons, but only if the interaction with groundwater is properly accounted for. At the moment uncertainty in future summer precipitation changes limits our ability to predict impacts on water resources.",https://doi.org/10.1029/2018WR024381,10.1029/2018WR024381,"Erler, Andre R.; Frey, Steven K.; Khader, Omar; d'Orgeville, Marc; Park, Young-Jin; Hwang, Hyoun-Tae; Lapen, David R.; Peltier, W.

FALSE,27,Stochastic Decadal Projections of Colorado River Streamflow and Reservoir Pool Elevations Conditioned on Temperature Projections,"Decadal (similar to 10-year)-scale flow projections in the Colorado River Basin (CRB) are increasingly important for water resources management and planning of its reservoir system. Physical models, ensemble streamflow prediction (ESP), do not have skill beyond interannual time scales. However, Global Climate Models have good skill in projecting decadal temperatures. This, combined with the sensitivity of CRB flows to temperature from recent studies, motivate the research question, can skill in decadal temperature projections be translated to operationally skillful flow projections and consequently, water resources management? To explore this, we used temperature projections from the Community Earth System Model-Decadal Prediction Large Ensemble (CESM-DPLE) along with past basin runoff efficiency as covariates in a Random Forest (RF) method to project ensembles of multiyear mean flow at the key aggregate gauge of Lees Ferry, Arizona. RF streamflow projections outperformed both ESP and climatology in a 1982-2017 hindcast, as measured by ranked probability skill score. The projections were disaggregated to monthly and subbasin scales to drive the Colorado River Mid-term Modeling System (CRMMS) to generate ensembles of water management variables. The projections of pool elevations in Lakes Powell and Mead, the two largest U.S. reservoirs that are critical for water resources management in the basin, were found to reduce the hindcast median root mean square error by up to -20% and -30% at lead times of 48 and 60 months, respectively, relative to projections generated from ESP.

FALSE,29,Forecast Informed Reservoir Operations Using Ensemble Streamflow Predictions for a Multipurpose Reservoir in Northern California,"Ensemble Forecast Operations (EFO) is a risk-based approach of reservoir flood control operations that incorporates ensemble streamflow predictions (ESPs) made by the California-Nevada River Forecast Center. Reservoir operations for each member of an ESP are individually modeled to forecast system conditions and calculate risk of reaching critical operational thresholds. Reservoir release decisions are simulated to manage forecasted risk with respect to established risk tolerance levels. EFO was developed for Lake Mendocino, a 111,000 acre-foot reservoir near Ukiah, California, to evaluate its viability to improve reservoir storage reliability without increasing downstream flood risk. Lake Mendocino is a dual use reservoir, owned and operated for flood control by the United States Army Corps of Engineers and operated for water supply by Sonoma Water. EFO was simulated using a 26-year (1985-2010) ESP hindcast generated by the California-Nevada River Forecast Center, which provides 61-member ensembles of 15-day flow forecasts. EFO simulations yield generally higher storage levels during the flood management season while maintaining needed flood storage capacity by strategically prereleasing water in advance of forecasted storms. Model results demonstrate a 33% increase in median storage at the end of the flood management season (10 May) over existing operations without marked changes in flood frequency for locations downstream from Lake Mendocino. EFO may be a viable alternative for managing flood control operations at Lake Mendocino that provides multiple benefits (water supply, flood mitigation, and ecosystems) and provides a management framework that could be adapted and applied to other flood control reservoirs.",https://doi.org/10.1029/2019WR026604,10.1029/2019WR026604,"Delaney, Chris J.; Hartman, Robert K.; Mendoza, John; Dettinger, Michael; Delle Monache, Luca; Jasperse, Jay; Ralph, F.

FALSE,39,Ensemble hydrological forecasts for reservoir management of the Shipshaw River catchment using limited data,"Many hydropower companies continue to rely on expert judgment to manage the operations of their reservoirs. Decision-support systems, composed of a hydrological forecasting system and a reservoir model, can ensure that reservoir operation objectives are attained more effectively than by relying solely on expert judgment. In this study, a simple ensemble inflow forecasting system coupled with a reservoir model is developed and the proposed model-based operational water management decisions are compared with those based on expert judgment for the Shipshaw River in Quebec, Canada. Given that no natural streamflow records are available for the Shipshaw River, the HEC-HMS hydrological model is calibrated using a regionalization method based on physical similarity. The calibrated hydrological model is fed by ensemble meteorological forecasts that include 20 members, with a 10-day horizon and a 6-hour time step. The proposed decision-support system can help avoid small flooding events while potentially improving energy production by 2 to 60% for this case study.

FALSE,41,Predictability of Seasonal Streamflow Forecasting Based on CSM: Case Studies of Top Three Largest Rivers in China,"Accurate seasonal streamflow forecasting is important in reservoir operation, watershed planning, and water resource management, and streamflow forecasting is often based on hydrological models driven by coupled global climate models (CGCMs). To understand streamflow forecasting predictability, this study considered the three largest rivers in China and explored deterministic and probabilistic skill metrics on the monthly scale according to ensemble streamflow hindcasts from the hydrological model Hydrologiska Byrans Vattenbalansavdelning (HBV) driven by multiple climate forcings from the climate system model by the Beijing Climate Center (BCC_CSM1.1m). The effects of initial conditions (ICs) and meteorological forcings (MFs) on skill were investigated using the conventional ensemble streamflow prediction (ESP) and reverse-ESP (revESP). The results revealed the following: (1) Skill declines as lead time increases, and forecasting is generally the most skillful for lead month 1; (2) skill is higher for dry rivers than wet rivers, and higher for dry target months than wet months for the Yellow and Yangtze Rivers, suggesting greater skill in potential drought forecasting than flood forecasting; (3) the relative operating characteristic (ROC) area is greater for abnormal terciles than the near-normal tercile for all three rivers, greater for the above-normal tercile than the below-normal tercile for the Yellow and Yangtze Rivers, but slightly greater for the below-normal tercile than the above-normal tercile for the Xijiang River; and (4) the influence of ICs outweighs that of MFs in dry months, and the period of influence varies from 1 to 3 months; however, the influence of MFs is dominant in wet target months. These findings will help improve the understanding of both the seasonal streamflow forecasting predictability based on coupled climate system/hydrological models and of streamflow forecasting for variable rivers and seasons.",https://doi.org/10.3390/w13020162,10.3390/w13020162,"Liu, Lyuliu; Wu, Ying; Zhang, Peiqun; Zhai, Jianqing; Zhang, Li; Xiao, Chan",WATER,Pearl River; predictability; seasonal streamflow forecasting; Yangtze River; Yellow River,NA,NA,MDPI,BASEL,"ST ALBAN-ANLAGE 66, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND",NA,2073-4441,NA,WATER-SUI,Water,JAN,2021,13,2,NA,NA,162,NA
FALSE,42,Web-based data analytics framework for well forecasting and groundwater quality,"Groundwater supplies drinking water for over one-third of all Americans. However, with aquifers stressed by overdraft, contamination from land use, and the hydrologic impacts of climate change, identifying reliable sources for new wells is increasingly challenging. Well forecasting is a process in which potential groundwater resources are evaluated for a location of interest. While this process forecasts the depth of each aquifer for a given location, it takes historical groundwater well data from nearby locations into account. Conventionally, well forecasting is done by geological survey professionals by manually analyzing the well data and, that makes the process both time and resource-intensive. This study presents a novel web application that performs well forecasting for any location within the state of Iowa in a matter of seconds utilizing client-side computing instead of expensive professional labor. The web application generates well forecasts by triangulating millions of combinations of historical aquifer depth data of nearby wells stored in a state-level database. The proposed web system also provides water quality information for arsenic, nitrate, and bacteria (total c and fecal coliform) on the same interface with forecasts. The system is open to the public and is aimed to provide a go-to tool for homeowners, well drillers and, authorities to help inform decision-making regarding groundwater well development and water quality monitoring efforts.

For example, if managers received a forecast indicating a high likelihood of impending impairment, they could make decisions today to prevent or mitigate poor water quality in the future. Increasing the number of automated, real-time freshwater forecasts used for management requires integrating interdisciplinary expertise to develop a framework that seamlessly links data, models, and cyberinfrastructure, as well as collaborations with managers to ensure that forecasts are embedded into decision-making workflows. The goal of this study is to advance the implementation of near-term, iterative ecological forecasts for freshwater management.

We used FLARE to develop scenario forecasts simulating different water quality interventions to inform manager decision-making. Second, we share lessons learned from our experience developing and running FLARE over 2 years to inform other forecasting projects.

FALSE,48,Robust multiobjective reservoir operation and risk decision-making model for real-time flood control coping with forecast uncertainty,"Forecast uncertainty in real-time flood forecasting is the primary source of risk regarding reservoir flood control operation, affecting both reliability and safety of the entire system. Informing reservoir operation for real-time flood control coping with forecast uncertainty encourages overall robust control of risk probability, vulnerability, and resilience of upstream and downstream protection areas. Current stochastic programming models or chance constrained programming models (CCP) focuses on reducing either risk loss or vulnerability, thereby failing to ensure systematic control. This study established a robust multiobjective operation and risk decision-making model to inform reservoir operations. The proposed model includes three modules. First, a copula function was applied to capture multidimensional temporal dependences of forecast uncertainties, following which stochastic inflow scenarios were generated. Second, a robust multiobjective optimization (RMOO) model was established with the objectives of minimizing the probability of risk events, Conditional Value-at-Risk of risk loss (vulnerability) and the maximum sequential duration for both upstream and downstream areas. Then, an adaptive reference multiobjective evolutionary algorithm was used to solve the model and obtain noninferior solutions. Finally, the TOPSIS multicriteria decision-making method was introduced to select the compromise solution. Methodologies were verified by application to Xianghongdian reservoir, China. The main findings were as follows. (1) The copula function effectively captured the multidimensional positive temporal dependences of forecast uncertainties. (2) RMOO provided more widely distributed noninferior solutions than CCP, and performed better in lowering vulnerability of the system. (3) RMOO reduced the maximum release by 135.6 m(3)/s (7.33%) by increasing prerelease before the occurrence of flood peak.

Medium- and long-rage forecasts of Nile flows at Aswan have been recognized as of significant importance to allow better management and operation of the water resource facilities and mitigate the risks of both droughts and floods. In this study, a wide range of climate indices and atmospheric fields were used as potential predictors for long-range forecasting of Nile streamflow for one flood season ahead (July-October). The approach followed in this study focuses on searching for potential predictors, reducing the pool of potential predictors by using multivariate statistical analysis, applying sequentially, Canonical Correlation Analysis, Principal Component Analysis, and multiple linear regression to robustly forecast the Nile flow. The proposed approach proved to be very useful for improving long-range Nile River flow forecasting.

FALSE,51,Enhancing the Predictability of Seasonal Streamflow With a Statistical-Dynamical Approach,"Seasonal streamflow forecasts facilitate water allocation, reservoir operation, flood risk management, and crop forecasting. They are generally computed by forcing hydrological models with outputs from general circulation models (GCMs) or using large-scale climate indices as predictors in statistical models. In contrast, hybrid statistical-dynamical forecasts (combining statistical methods with dynamical climate predictions) are still uncommon, and their skill is largely unknown. Here we conduct systematic forecasting of seasonal streamflow using eight GCMs from the North American Multi-Model Ensemble, 0.5-9.5 months ahead, at 290 stream gauges in the U.S. Midwest. Probabilistic forecasts are developed for low to high streamflow using predictors that reflect climatic and anthropogenic influences. Results indicate that GCM forecasts of climate and antecedent climatic conditions enhance seasonal streamflow predictability; while land cover and population density predictors decrease biases or enhance skill in certain catchments. This paper paves the way for novel forecasting approaches using dynamical GCM predictions within statistical frameworks. Plain Language Summary Streamflow forecasts several months ahead of a season are important for water management and the prevention of risks related to floods and hydrological droughts. However, existing methods for producing seasonal streamflow forecasts are often complex and computationally intensive. Here we provide a systematic evaluation of a statistical-dynamical approach to streamflow forecasting in several hundred river catchments across the U.S. Midwest. We assess whether global climate model forecasts can be used as predictors in statistical models to produce skillful forecasts of river flow, up to 10 months ahead. Results indicate that forecasts of rainfall and temperature, antecedent climatic conditions, as well as information on population density and land cover, can be used effectively to forecast streamflow at seasonal time scales. By including information on the future antecedent climatic conditions, streamflow forecasts can be enhanced months ahead. Information on human influences, in contrast, helps reduce the biases in the streamflow forecasts. These results pave the way for statistical-dynamical forecasting in catchments around the world and suggest that process-driven combinations of different predictors can be used to produce skillful streamflow forecasts in different seasons, for both high flows (i.e., floods) and low flows (i.e., representative of hydrological droughts).",https://doi.org/10.1029/2018GL077945,10.1029/2018GL077945,"Slater, Louise J.; Villarini, Gabriele",GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH LETTERS,streamflow; forecast; NMME; precipitation; temperature; land cover,CENTRAL UNITED-STATES; PREDICTION SYSTEM; FORECASTS; CLIMATE; SCALE; MODELS; SKILL,NA,AMER GEOPHYSICAL UNION,WASHINGTON,"2000 FLORIDA AVE NW, WASHINGTON, DC 20009 USA",0094-8276,1944-8007,NA,GEOPHYS RES LETT,Geophys.

The majority of annual runoff is derived from spring snowmelt, and therefore April-July water supply volume (WSV) forecasts produced by the Colorado Basin River Forecast Center are critical to basin water management. The primary objective of this study was to evaluate the impact of snow data assimilation (DA) in a distributed hydrologic model on WSV forecasting error and skill in headwater catchments of the UCRB. To do this, a framework was built to use the Localized Ensemble transform Kalman filter to update modeled snow water equivalent (SWE) states in the Hydrology Laboratory-Research Distributed Hydrologic Model with SNOTEL SWE observations and spatially and temporally complete MODIS Snow Covered-Area and Grain size data. The DA approach was assessed by evaluating ensemble streamflow prediction forecasts over a 20-year period for 23 catchments in the UCRB. Overall, the DA approach improved water supply forecast skill in 80% of pilot basins with an average improvement in the median continuous rank probability skill score of 4%. A research-to-operations transition was facilitated by automating the implementation of the DA approach.

FALSE,57,AI-based techniques for multi-step streamflow forecasts: application for multi-objective reservoir operation optimization and performance assessment,"Streamflow forecasts are traditionally effective in mitigating water scarcity and flood defense. This study developed an artificial intelligence (AI)-based management methodology that integrated multi-step streamflow forecasts and multi-objective reservoir operation optimization for water resource allocation. Following the methodology, we aimed to assess forecast quality and forecast-informed reservoir operation performance together due to the influence of inflow forecast uncertainty. Varying combinations of climate and hydrological variables were input into three AI-based models, namely a long short-term memory (LSTM), a gated recurrent unit (GRU), and a least-squares support vector machine (LSSVM), to forecast short-term streamflow. Based on three deterministic forecasts, the stochastic inflow scenarios were further developed using Bayesian model averaging (BMA) for quantifying uncertainty. The forecasting scheme was further coupled with a multi-reservoir optimization model, and the multi-objective programming was solved using the parameterized multi-objective robust decision-making (MORDM) approach. The AI-based management framework was applied and demonstrated over a multi-reservoir system (25 reservoirs) in the Zhoushan Islands, China. Three main conclusions were drawn from this study: (1) GRU and LSTM performed equally well on streamflow forecasts, and GRU might be the preferred method over LSTM, given that it had simpler structures and less modeling time; (2) higher forecast performance could lead to improved reservoir operation, while uncertain forecasts were more valuable than deterministic forecasts, regarding two performance metrics, i.e., water supply reliability and operating costs; (3) the relationship between the forecast horizon and reservoir operation was complex and depended on the operating configurations (forecast quality and uncertainty) and performance measures.

Then we evaluate the performance of raw and post-processed streamflow forecasts for the four hydrological stations along the mainstream of Hanjiang River from 2001 to 2008. The results show that the performance of the streamflow forecasts is greatly enhanced with post-processing precipitation forecasts, especially in pre-dry season (November and December), thus providing useful information for water supply management of the central route of South to North Water Diversion Project (SNWDP).

FALSE,63,Variance decomposition of forecasted sediment transport in a lowland watershed using global climate model ensembles,"Forecasting change in sediment transport using global climate model ensembles is under-developed in the hydrology community due to a lack of knowledge regarding the variance structure of predictions. We investigate the uncertainty of forecast sediment transport from sources, including global climate model realizations, global climate model ensemble design, forecasted hydrologic inputs, and hydrologic modeling parameterization. We then forecast sediment transport for the gently rolling watershed in Kentucky, USA. Contrary to past research forecasting hydrology with global climate models, hydrologic model parameterization was the most significant source of variance impacting forecasted sediment transport variables. Forecast of sediment transport responses shows the propagation of uncertainty from the hydrologic model parameterization was over two times greater than the uncertainty from the selected global climate model realizations. This result emphasizes researchers focused on forecasting sediment transport with global climate models may need to give as much, or more, consideration to their water-sediment linkages as climate-water-sediment linkages. Hydrologic inputs from climate change, including forecast precipitation, temperature, relative humidity, solar radiation, and wind speed, impacted sediment transport. Considering changes in precipitation and temperature alone under-predicts streamflow and sediment transport by 49% and 35%, respectively, compared to including all meteorological variables inputs. Variance introduced across the three different global climate model ensembles was a relatively small source of variance impacting forecasted streamflow or sediment yield. The results suggest a quantitative effort by the researcher to design the global climate model ensemble by considering representativeness, historical performance, and independency will lead to robust results. Ensemble average forecasts forecast streamflow and sediment yield to increase by 19% and 14%, respectively, for the lowland watershed.

The advancement and availability of the seasonal flow forecasts provide the opportunity for reservoir operators to use flexible and early impoundment operation rules (EIOR). These flexible impoundment rules can significantly improve water conservation, particularly during dry years. In this study, we investigate the potential application of seasonal streamflow forecasts for employing EIOR in the upper Yangtze River basin. We first define thresholds to determine the streamflow condition in September, which is an important period for decision-making in the basin, and then select the most suitable impoundment operation rules accordingly. The thresholds are used in a simulation-optimization model to evaluate different scenarios for EIOR and SIOR by multiple objectives. We measure the skill of the GloFAS-Seasonal forecast, an operational global seasonal river flow forecasting system, to predict streamflow condition according to the selected thresholds. The results show that: (1) the 20th and 30th percentiles of the historical September flow are suitable thresholds for evaluating the possibility of employing EIOR; (2) compared to climatological forecasts, GloFAS-Seasonal forecasts are skillful for predicting the streamflow condition according to the selected 20th and 30th percentile thresholds; and (3) during dry years, EIOR could improve the fullness storage rate by 5.63% and the annual average hydropower generation by 4.02%, without increasing the risk of flooding.

As the mechanism of algal blooms is not understood, the construction of prediction model mainly depends on statistical data. Therefore, knowledge on prior bloom occurrence derived from statistical data plays a significant role in establishing a prediction model. In this study, a naive Bayesian model incorporating prior information was constructed to predict algal bloom occurrence probabilities 1-7 days in advance under different weather conditions in Dianchi Lake. The proposed model utilised the following data from the MODIS images, the floating algae index (FAI) for the previous 7 days and five meteorological variables (mean wind speed, air pressure, relative humidity on the prediction day, accumulated sunshine hours in the previous 3 days, and accumulated air temperature in the previous 7 days). The prior probabilities of each pixel were calculated on a monthly timescale to highlight the bloom's temporal-spatial differences, and the 1-7 day posterior probabilities were calculated by combining the prior and conditional probabilities. The predictive effect was tested by the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC), and the results showed the number of pixels with estimation predictions classified as 'Good+' and 'Excellent' were 91.3%, 91.4%, 82.7%, 83.3%, 89.0%, 86.6%, and 90.0% for the predictions on days 1-7, respectively. Additionally, the independent validation datasets showed that the percentage of correctly classified instances (CCI%) of approximately 90% of the pixels were greater than 50%.

FALSE,71,Understanding and seasonal forecasting of hydrological drought in the Anthropocene,"Hydrological drought is not only caused by natural hydroclimate variability but can also be directly altered by human interventions including reservoir operation, irrigation, groundwater exploitation, etc. Understanding and forecasting of hydrological drought in the Anthropocene are grand challenges due to complicated interactions among climate, hydrology and humans. In this paper, five decades (1961-2010) of naturalized and observed streamflow datasets are used to investigate hydrological drought characteristics in a heavily managed river basin, the Yellow River basin in north China. Human interventions decrease the correlation between hydrological and meteorological droughts, and make the hydrological drought respond to longer time-scales of meteorological drought. Due to large water consumptions in the middle and lower reaches, there are 118-262% increases in the hydrological drought frequency, up to 8-fold increases in the drought severity, 21-99% increases in the drought duration and the drought onset is earlier. The non-stationarity due to anthropogenic climate change and human water use basically decreases the correlation between meteorological and hydrological droughts and reduces the effect of human interventions on hydrological drought frequency while increasing the effect on drought duration and severity. A set of 29-year (1982-2010) hindcasts from an established seasonal hydrological forecasting system are used to assess the forecast skill of hydrological drought. In the naturalized condition, the climate-model-based approach outperforms the climatology method in predicting the 2001 severe hydrological drought event. Based on the 29-year hindcasts, the former method has a Brier skill score of 11-26% against the latter for the probabilistic hydrological drought forecasting. In the Anthropocene, the skill for both approaches increases due to the dominant influence of human interventions that have been implicitly incorporated by the hydrological postprocessing, while the difference between the two predictions decreases. This suggests that human interventions can outweigh the climate variability for the hydrological drought forecasting in the Anthropocene, and the predictability for human interventions needs more attention.",https://doi.org/10.5194/hess-21-5477-2017,10.5194/hess-21-5477-2017,"Yuan, Xing; Zhang, Miao; Wang, Linying; Zhou, Tian",HYDROLOGY AND EARTH SYSTEM SCIENCES,NA,STANDARDIZED PRECIPITATION INDEX; YELLOW-RIVER BASIN; SOIL-MOISTURE; WATER-RESOURCES; CLIMATE-CHANGE; SURFACE-WATER; STREAMFLOW; PREDICTION; SYSTEM; SKILL,NA,COPERNICUS GESELLSCHAFT MBH,GOTTINGEN,"BAHNHOFSALLEE 1E, GOTTINGEN, 37081, GERMANY",1027-5606,1607-7938,NA,HYDROL EARTH SYST SC,Hydrol.

FALSE,74,"Use of Seasonal Streamflow Forecasts for Flood Mitigation with Adaptive Reservoir Operation: A Case Study of the Chao Phraya River Basin, Thailand, in 2011","Predicting streamflow can help water managers make policy decisions for individual river basins. In 2011, heavy rainfall from May until October resulted in the largest flood event in the history of Thailand. This event created difficulty for water managers, who lacked information to make predictions. Studies on the 2011 Thai flood have proposed alternative reservoir operations for flood mitigation. However, no study to date has used predictive information to determine how to control reservoirs and mitigate such extreme floods. Thus, the objective of this study is to update and develop a method for using streamflow predictive data to support adaptive reservoir operation with the aim of mitigating the 2011 flood. The study area was the Chao Phraya River Basin, one of the most important basins in Thailand. We obtained predictive information from a hydrological model with a reservoir operation module using an ensemble of seasonal precipitation data from the European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts (ECMWF). The six-month ECMWF prediction period was used to support the operation plan for mitigating flooding in 2011 around each reservoir during the wet season. Decision-making for reservoir operation based on seasonal predictions was conducted on a monthly time scale. The results showed that peak river discharge decreased slightly, by around 4%, when seasonal predictive data were used. Moreover, changing the reservoir operation plan and using seasonal predictions decreased the peak river discharge by around 20%.",https://doi.org/10.3390/w12113210,10.3390/w12113210,"Kompor, Wongnarin; Yoshikawa, Sayaka; Kanae, Shinjiro",WATER,adaptive reservoir operation; ECMWF predictive data; H08 model; reservoir operation; river management; streamflow prediction; Thailand,OPTIMIZATION MODEL; GENETIC ALGORITHM; SOIL-MOISTURE; CLIMATE; SKILL; PRECIPITATION,NA,MDPI,BASEL,"ST ALBAN-ANLAGE 66, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND",NA,2073-4441,NA,WATER-SUI,Water,NOV,2020,12,11,NA,NA,3210,NA
FALSE,76,A Near-Term Iterative Forecasting System Successfully Predicts Reservoir Hydrodynamics and Partitions Uncertainty in Real Time,"Freshwater ecosystems are experiencing greater variability due to human activities, necessitating new tools to anticipate future water quality. In response, we developed and deployed a real-time iterative water temperature forecasting system (FLARE-Forecasting Lake And Reservoir Ecosystems). FLARE is composed of water temperature and meteorology sensors that wirelessly stream data, a data assimilation algorithm that uses sensor observations to update predictions from a hydrodynamic model and calibrate model parameters, and an ensemble-based forecasting algorithm to generate forecasts that include uncertainty. Importantly, FLARE quantifies the contribution of different sources of uncertainty (driver data, initial conditions, model process, and parameters) to each daily forecast of water temperature at multiple depths. We applied FLARE to Falling Creek Reservoir (Vinton, Virginia, USA), a drinking water supply, during a 475-day period encompassing stratified and mixed thermal conditions. Aggregated across this period, root mean square error (RMSE) of daily forecasted water temperatures was 1.13 degrees C at the reservoir's near-surface (1.0 m) for 7-day ahead forecasts and 1.62 degrees C for 16-day ahead forecasts. The RMSE of forecasted water temperatures at the near-sediments (8.0 m) was 0.87 degrees C for 7-day forecasts and 1.20 degrees C for 16-day forecasts. FLARE successfully predicted the onset of fall turnover 4-14 days in advance in two sequential years. Uncertainty partitioning identified meteorology driver data as the dominant source of uncertainty in forecasts for most depths and thermal conditions, except for the near-sediments in summer, when model process uncertainty dominated. Overall, FLARE provides an open-source system for lake and reservoir water quality forecasting to improve real-time management.",https://doi.org/10.1029/2019WR026138,10.1029/2019WR026138,"Thomas, R.

FALSE,77,Coupling large-scale climate indices with a stochastic weather generator to improve long-term streamflow forecasts in a Canadian watershed,"This paper aims at improving long-term streamflow forecasts by implementing a novel technique based on conditioning the parameters of a stochastic weather generator on large-scale climate indices, with varying lengths of training periods during the establishment of correlations. The most important climate indices are identified by looking at yearly correlations between a set of 40 indices and meteorological data (precipitation and temperature) at the watershed scale. A linear model is then constructed to identify precipitation and temperature anomalies to induce perturbations in the stochastic weather generator. Time windows of 5, 10, 15, 20 and 30 years are used in determining the optimal linear model. The performance of the proposed approach is assessed against that of a resampling of past climatology and using the same stochastic weather generator unconditioned on climate indices. Each member of the ensemble weather forecast is then fed to a hydrological model to create the Ensemble Streamflow Forecasts (ESF) with a one-year forecasting horizon. The three approaches are tested in hindcast mode over a 30-year period at 12 forecast dates. Results show that temperatures are significantly correlated with large-scale climate indices, whereas precipitation is only weakly related to the same indices. The length of the time window has a considerable impact on the prediction ability of the linear models. The precipitation models based on short duration time windows performed better than those based on longer windows, while the reverse was found for the temperature models. A comparison between all three Ensemble Streamflow Forecast approaches is assessed using the Continuous Ranked Probability Score (CRPS) metric. Results show that the proposed method improves long-term streamflow forecasting, particularly the volumetric bias and the peak flows during the spring flood.",https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jhydrol.2020.125925,10.1016/j.jhydrol.2020.125925,"Sohrabi, Samaneh; Brissette, Francois P.; Arsenault, Richard",JOURNAL OF HYDROLOGY,Long-term streamflow forecast; Large-scale climate indices; Stochastic weather generator; Non-stationarity,LOW-FREQUENCY VARIABILITY; ENSEMBLE KALMAN FILTER; MODEL PARAMETERS; PRECIPITATION; PREDICTION; TEMPERATURE; SIMULATION; TIME; IMPACTS; ENSO,NA,ELSEVIER,AMSTERDAM,"RADARWEG 29, 1043 NX AMSTERDAM, NETHERLANDS",0022-1694,1879-2707,NA,J HYDROL,J.

FALSE,81,"Forecasting the evolution in the mixing regime of a deep subalpine lake under climate change scenarios through numerical modelling (Lake Maggiore, Northern Italy/Southern Switzerland)","The impact of air temperature rise is eminent for the large deep lakes in the Italian subalpine district, climate change being caused there by both natural phenomena and anthropogenic greenhouse-gases (GHG) emissions. These oligomictic lakes are experiencing a decrease in the frequency of winter full turnover and an intensification of stability. As a result, hypolimnetic oxygen concentrations are decreasing and nutrients are accumulating in bottom water, with effects on the whole ecosystem functioning. Forecasting the future evolution of the mixing pattern is relevant to assess if a reduction in GHG releases would be able to revert such processes. The study focuses on Lake Maggiore, for which the thermal structure evolution under climate change in the 2016-2085 period was assessed through numerical simulations, performed with the General Lake Model (GLM). Different prospects of regional air temperature rise were considered, given by the Swiss Climate Change Scenarios CH2011. Multiple realisations were performed for each scenario to obtain robust statistical predictions, adopting random series of meteorological data produced with the Vector-Autoregressive Weather Generator (VG). Results show that a reversion in the increasing thermal stability would be possible only if global GHG emissions started to be reduced by similar to 2020, allowing an equilibrium mixing regime to be restored by the end of the twenty-first century. Otherwise, persistent lack of complete-mixing, severe water warming and extensive effects on water quality are to be expected for the centuries to come.

Therefore, there is a need for the early anticipation of low-flow periods to improve water management. This is strengthened by the perspective of having more severe low flows in the context of climate change. Several French institutions have been collaborating over the last years to develop an operational tool for low-flow forecasting, called PREMHYCE. It was tested in real time on more than one hundred catchments in continental France since 2017. PREMHYCE includes five hydrological models, which are calibrated on gauged catchments and which assimilate flow observations. Low-flow forecasts can be issued up to 90 days ahead, based on Ensemble Streamflow Prediction (ESP) using historical climatic data as ensembles of future input scenarios. The performance of the forecasting tool is analysed on the 2017-2018 low flows on 38 catchments for which forecasts are available for all the models.

FALSE,89,Projected Hydroclimatic Changes in Two Major River Basins at the Canadian West Coast Based on High-Resolution Regional Climate Simulations,"The impact of anthropogenic climate change on water resources and flood and drought risk is of great interest for impact modeling and to inform adaptation strategies. Here an analysis of hydroclimatic changes in the Fraser and Athabasca River basins in western Canada is presented, based on an ensemble of climate projections, which have been dynamically downscaled to 10-km resolution using the Weather Research and Forecasting Model in two configurations. The GCM ensemble comprises four independent integrations of the Community Earth System Model under the representative concentration pathway 8.5. Basin-integrated changes in the seasonal cycle of hydroclimatic variables, and the variability of water supply and flood and drought risk, are considered. It is found that fall and winter precipitation generally increase by 20%-30% toward the end of the century, while changes in summer precipitation are smaller and associated with high model uncertainty. Furthermore, a reduction in snowfall and an increase in evapotranspiration are projected. However, projected impacts on water resources east and west of the Rocky Mountains are quite different: in basins closer to the coast (west of the Rocky Mountains) higher temperatures lead to a transition from predominantly solid to liquid precipitation and a significantly weaker spring freshet, followed by drier summers. In the lee of the Rocky Mountains the spring freshet remains largely unaffected and in summer the increase in evapotranspiration (ET) is compensated by increasing precipitation, so that water balance changes appear to be small. It is further found that a shift in runoff seasonality near the coast may lead to significantly increased flood risk in fall.",https://doi.org/10.1175/JCLI-D-16-0870.1,10.1175/JCLI-D-16-0870.1,"Erler, Andre R.; Peltier, W.

FALSE,92,Introduction of an Experimental Terrestrial Forecasting/Monitoring System at Regional to Continental Scales Based on the Terrestrial Systems Modeling Platform (v1.1.0),"Operational weather and flood forecasting has been performed successfully for decades and is of great socioeconomic importance. Up to now, forecast products focus on atmospheric variables, such as precipitation, air temperature and, in hydrology, on river discharge. Considering the full terrestrial system from groundwater across the land surface into the atmosphere, a number of important hydrologic variables are missing especially with regard to the shallow and deeper subsurface (e.g., groundwater), which are gaining considerable attention in the context of global change. In this study, we propose a terrestrial monitoring/forecasting system using the Terrestrial Systems Modeling Platform (TSMP) that predicts all essential states and fluxes of the terrestrial hydrologic and energy cycles from groundwater into the atmosphere. Closure of the terrestrial cycles provides a physically consistent picture of the terrestrial system in TSMP. TSMP has been implemented over a regional domain over North Rhine-Westphalia and a continental domain over Europe in a real-time forecast/monitoring workflow. Applying a real-time forecasting/monitoring workflow over both domains, experimental forecasts are being produced with different lead times since the beginning of 2016. Real-time forecast/monitoring products encompass all compartments of the terrestrial system including additional hydrologic variables, such as plant available soil water, groundwater table depth, and groundwater recharge and storage.",https://doi.org/10.3390/w10111697,10.3390/w10111697,"Kollet, Stefan; Gasper, Fabian; Brdar, Slavko; Goergen, Klaus; Hendricks-Franssen, Harrie-Jan; Keune, Jessica; Kurtz, Wolfgang; Kuell, Volker; Pappenberger, Florian; Poll, Stefan; Troemel, Silke; Shrestha, Prabhakar; Simmer, Clemens; Sulis, Mauro",WATER,terrestrial modeling; real-time forecasting/monitoring; workflows,RAINFALL MEASUREMENT; WEATHER PREDICTION; FORECAST SYSTEM; GROUNDWATER; PARALLEL; ATTENUATION; COSMO,NA,MDPI,BASEL,"ST ALBAN-ANLAGE 66, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND",2073-4441,NA,NA,WATER-SUI,Water,NOV,2018,10,11,NA,NA,1697,NA

This study proposed a simple yet efficient approach, the Bivar_update model that utilizes bivariate climate forecast to update individual probabilities of the ensemble streamflow prediction. The Bayesian updating scheme is used to update the joint probability mass function derived from historic precipitation and temperature data sets. Thirty-five dam basins were used for the case study, and the modified Tank model was embedded into the ensemble streamflow prediction framework. The performance of the proposed approach was evaluated through a comparison with a reference streamflow forecast model, the Univar_update model, that reflects only precipitation forecast, in terms of deterministic and categorical streamflow forecast accuracy. For this purpose, multiple cases of probabilistic precipitation and temperature forecasts were synthetically generated. As a result, the Bivar_update model was able to decrease the errors in forecast under below-normal conditions. The improvements in forecasting skills were found for both measures; deterministic and categorical streamflow forecasts. Since the proposed Bivar_update model reflects both precipitation and temperature information, it can compensate low predictability especially under dry conditions in which the streamflow's dependency on temperature increases.",https://doi.org/10.3390/su12072905,10.3390/su12072905,"Sung, Jang Hyun; Ryu, Young; Seo, Seung Beom",SUSTAINABILITY,probabilistic forecast; Bayesian update; Croley-Wilks; joint probability mass function; ensemble streamflow prediction,PRECIPITATION; TEMPERATURE; IMPACTS; WEATHER; MODEL; OPTIMIZATION; SIMULATIONS; DROUGHT; KOREA,NA,MDPI,BASEL,"ST ALBAN-ANLAGE 66, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND",NA,2071-1050,NA,SUSTAINABILITY-BASEL,Sustainability,APR,2020,12,7,NA,NA,2905,NA
FALSE,97,The Value of Long-Term Streamflow Forecasts in Adaptive Reservoir Operation: The Case of the High Aswan Dam in the Transboundary Nile River Basin,"Transboundary river basins are experiencing extensive dam development that challenges future water management, especially for downstream nations. Thus, adapting the operation of existing reservoirs is indispensable to cope with alterations in flow regime. We proposed a Forecast-Based Adaptive Reservoir Operation (FARO) framework to evaluate the use of long-term climate forecasts in improving real-time reservoir operations. The FARO approach was applied to the High Aswan Dam (HAD) in the Nile River basin. Monthly precipitation and temperature forecasts at up to 12 months of lead time are used from a suite of eight North American Multi-Model Ensemble (NMME) models. The value of NMME-based forecasts to reservoir operations was compared with perfect and climatology-based forecasts over an optimization horizon of 10 years from 1993 to 2002. Our results indicated that the forecast horizon for HAD operation ranges between 5 and 12 months lead time at low- and high-demand scenarios, respectively, beyond which the forecast information no longer improves the release decision. The forecast value to HAD operation is more pronounced in the months following the flooding season (October-December). During these months, the skill of streamflow forecasts using NMME forcings outperforms the climatology-based forecasts. When considering the operation of upstream Grand Ethiopian Renaissance Dam (GERD), using streamflow forecasts minimally helps to maintain current target objectives of HAD operation and therefore result in higher operation costs as opposed to current conditions without GERD. Our study underlined the importance of deriving a new adaptive operating policy for HAD to improve the value of available forecasts while considering GERD filling and operation phases. SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT Water management in the Nile River basin is challenged by the construction of the Grand Ethiopian Renaissance Dam (GERD) in Ethiopia. Thus, it becomes important to adapt the operation of existing dams to expected alteration in upstream flow. This study aims to use long-term forecasts to improve real-time operations of the High Aswan Dam (HAD) in Egypt. Forecasting streamflow up to 8 months ahead showed a significant improvement in the HAD operation. However, when considering GERD, using forecasts could minimally help to maintain current objectives of HAD operation. Our findings underline the importance of deriving a new operating policy for HAD to improve the value of available forecasts while considering future upstream projects.",https://doi.org/10.1175/JHM-D-20-0241.1,10.1175/JHM-D-20-0241.1,"Eldardiry, Hisham; Hossain, Faisal",JOURNAL OF HYDROMETEOROLOGY,Rivers; Forecast verification; skill; Operational forecasting; Seasonal forecasting; Hydrologic models; Optimization,BLUE-NILE; WATER-RESOURCES; MODEL; SYSTEMS; RULES; LEAD; PREDICTABILITY; UNCERTAINTY; PREDICTION; RAINFALL,NA,AMER METEOROLOGICAL SOC,BOSTON,"45 BEACON ST, BOSTON, MA 02108-3693 USA",1525-755X,1525-7541,NA,J HYDROMETEOROL,J.

The performance of MLR is then compared with the categorical forecasts estimated from the traditional approach, principal component regression (PCR). Results from both cross validation and split sampling reveal that in general, the probabilistic categorical forecasts from the MLR model have more accuracy and exhibit higher rank probability skill score (RPSS) compared to the PCR probabilistic forecasts. MLR forecasts are also more skillful than PCR forecasts during the winter season as well as for basins that exhibit high interannual variability in streamflows. The role of ensemble size of precipitation forecasts in developing MLR-based streamflow forecasts was also investigated.

FALSE,100,Evaluation of the Subseasonal Forecast Skill of Floods Associated with Atmospheric Rivers in Coastal Western US Watersheds,"Atmospheric rivers (ARs) are responsible for up to 90% of major flood events along the U.S. West Coast. The time scale of subseasonal forecasting (from 2 weeks to 1 month) is a critical lead time for proactive mitigation of flood disasters. The NOAA Climate Testbed Subseasonal Experiment (SubX) is a research-to-operations project with almost immediate availability of forecasts. It has produced a reforecast database that facilitates evaluation of flood forecasts at these subseasonal lead times. Here, we examine the SubX-driven forecast skill of AR-related flooding out to 4-week lead using the Distributed Hydrology Soil Vegetation Model (DHSVM), with particular attention to the role of antecedent soil moisture (ASM), which modulates the relationship between meteorological and hydrological forecast skill. We study three watersheds along a transect of the U.S. West Coast: the Chehalis River basin in Washington, the Russian River basin in Northern California, and the Santa Margarita River basin in Southern California. We find that the SubX-driven flood forecast skill drops quickly after week 1, during which there is relatively high deterministic forecast skill. We find some probabilistic forecast skill relative to climatology as well as ensemble streamflow prediction (ESP) in week 2, but minimal skill in weeks 3-4, especially for annual maximum floods, notwithstanding some probabilistic skill for smaller floods in week 3. Using ESP and reverse-ESP experiments to consider the relative influence of ASM and SubX reforecast skill, we find that ASM dominates probabilistic forecast skill only for small flood events at week 1, while SubX reforecast skill dominates for large flood events at all lead times.",https://doi.org/10.1175/JHM-D-20-0219.1,10.1175/JHM-D-20-0219.1,"Cao, Qian; Shukla, Shraddhanand; DeFlorio, Michael J.; Ralph, F.

FALSE,101,Improving real-time reservoir operation during flood season by making the most of streamflow forecasts,"Streamflow forecasts play an important role in real-time reservoir operation, especially during the flood season. However, nowcast, short-term, and mid-term forecasts have significant differences in their uncertainties, leading to a gap between these forecasts and their combined use. To make the most of these forecasts, this paper defines a reliable forecast horizon (RFH) and proposes a model based on the three-stage-based operation rule (Three-OR), in which the streamflow forecasts are jointly used with different levels of uncertainty. To evaluate the effectiveness and efficiency of the proposed model, it is applied to the Wan'an Reservoir located at the midstream of the Ganjiang River in China with the objectives of flood control and water utilization (i.e., hydropower generation and water supply). The results reveal the following: 1) both flood control and water utilization can be improved when compared with the current operation rule; 2) floods with a higher peak and larger volume gain more improvements using Three-OR; 3) a smaller difference in the forecast error produces better operation performance in water utilization; and 4) the extension of the RFH is beneficial for reservoir operation, as it can help to improve flood control if the flood is large; otherwise, it can help improve water utilization. In summary, the proposed model based on Three-OR can make the best use of streamflow information, thus improving the real-time reservoir operation during the flood season.",https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jhydrol.2021.126017,10.1016/j.jhydrol.2021.126017,"Wang, Jiabiao; Zhao, Tongtiegang; Zhao, Jianshi; Wang, Hao; Lei, Xiaohui",JOURNAL OF HYDROLOGY,Three-stage; Reliable forecast horizon; Flood control; Water utilization; KKT,SHORT-TERM OPERATION; MULTIPURPOSE RESERVOIR; RISK ANALYSIS; UNCERTAINTY; MANAGEMENT; MODELS; SKILL,NA,ELSEVIER,AMSTERDAM,"RADARWEG 29, 1043 NX AMSTERDAM, NETHERLANDS",0022-1694,1879-2707,NA,J HYDROL,J.

The objective was to describe, through land use/land cover change (LUCC), the natural physical processes under current conditions and to project them to 2029. Moreover, temperature and precipitation forecasts were estimated to detail possible effects of climate change. Using remote sensing techniques, satellite images were processed to prepare a projection to 2029. Water recharge was estimated considering the effects of slope, groundcover, and soil texture. Flash floods were estimated using lumped models, concatenating the information to HEC RAS. Water availability was estimated with a semi-distributed hydrological model (SWAT). Precipitation and temperature data were forecasted using autoregressive and exponential smoothing models. Under the forecast, forest and shrub covers show a growth of 6.6%, water recharge projects an increase of 7.16%. Flood flows suffer a reduction of up to 16.54%, and the flow regime with a 90% of probability of exceedance is 1.85% (7.72 l/s) higher for 2029 than for the 2019 scenario, so an improvement in flow regulation is evident. Forecasts show an increase in average temperature of 0.11 degrees C and 15.63% in extreme rainfall by 2029.

The objective of this study was to predict hourly flows in the Huaynamota River basin using the Discrete Kalman Filter (DKF), together with the autoregressive exogenous input model (ARX). Initially, the Kalman filter parameters are defined then recalculated for defined periods; that is, the model parameter values are constantly updated. Flows were forecasted six steps ahead (L=1, 2, 3, 4, 5 and 6 hours). The basin studied is part of the Huynamota River, delimited by the Chapalangana hydrometric station, upstream from the Aguamilpa reservoir, Nayarit, Mexico. The Huaynamota River is a tributary of the Santiago River. Hourly data series were used for precipitation and flow from August to September 2017.

FALSE,111,Coupling of a physically based lake model into the climate forecast system to improve winter climate forecasts for the Great Lakes region,"In this study, we coupled the two-layer one-dimensional Freshwater lake (FLake) model into the Climate Forecast System (CFS) version 2 to improve simulations of the effects of the Great Lakes on winter climate forecasts in that region. We first incorporated global lake fraction and depth data into the coupled CFS-FLake through a subgridding system. An interface between the CFS and FLake was then developed to link the two models for energy and water flux exchanges. The lake scheme was triggered only if the lake fraction was more than 10% in one CFS grid cell. We conducted ensemble retrospective forecasts with CFS-FLake for the period of 1997 through 2016 with 9 monthly leads. These forecasts were assessed to obtain a better understanding of the role of the Great Lakes in the climate system for winter, when significant lake-effect precipitation often occurs. Our results indicate that forecasts of lake surface temperature (LST), lake ice coverage (LIC), and precipitation with CFS-FLake were consistently better than those with CFS. The major improvements resulted from changes in land use type for the Great Lakes, from ocean and land in CFS to lakes in CFS-FLake. With the change from ocean to lake, LST mostly decreased with increasing LIC, resulting in lower surface heat and water fluxes to the atmosphere during the winter. However, with the change from land to lake, LST increased, leading to higher heat and water fluxes. In the meantime, precipitation predicted by CFS-FLake was reduced quite significantly over the Great Lakes compared to that by CFS. This reduction was caused by suppressed rising motion due to increased stability in the lower atmosphere as a result of lowered surface heat and water fluxes. The results from this study indicate that local and mesoscale surface and atmospheric processes significantly affect regional climate forecasts, and the coupled CFS-FLake model will have a broader impact on climate and hydrology research and forecasts.",https://doi.org/10.1007/s00382-019-04939-2,10.1007/s00382-019-04939-2,"Lv, Zhemin; Zhang, Shaobo; Jin, Jiming; Wu, Yihua; Ek, Michael B.",CLIMATE DYNAMICS,Climate forecasts; CFS; FLake; Lake-atmosphere coupled model; Lake effects,EFFECT SNOWSTORMS; HEAT FLUXES; ICE COVER; PREDICTION; SIMULATION; FLAKE; IMPLEMENTATION; BASIN,NA,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"ONE NEW YORK PLAZA, SUITE 4600, NEW YORK, NY, UNITED STATES",0930-7575,1432-0894,NA,CLIM DYNAM,Clim.

In this study, a hybrid machine-learning approach based on hydrological and data-driven modeling is developed for daily streamflow forecasting. The proposed hybrid hydrological data-driven model (HHDD) approach succeeds in improving daily prediction compared to that predicted by the standard conceptual hydrological model (HYMOD).

FALSE,115,Assessing the impacts of future climate change on the hydroclimatology of the Gediz Basin in Turkey by using dynamically downscaled CMIP5 projections,"The Gediz Basin is a Mediterranean watershed along the Aegean coast of Turkey, in which the most important economic activity is agriculture. Over the last few decades, this basin has been experiencing water-related problems such as water scarcity and competing use of water. This study assesses the impact of future climate change on the availability of water resources in the Gediz Basin during the 21st century by investigating the inflows into the major reservoir in the basin, Demirkopru Reservoir, which is the major source of irrigation water to the basin. The analysis in this study involves setting up a coupled hydro-climate model over the Gediz Basin by coupling the Weather Research and Forecasting (WRF) model to the physically-based Watershed Environmental Hydrology (WEHY) model. First, the WRF model is used to reconstruct the historical climatic variables over the basin by dynamically downscaling the ERA-Interim reanalysis dataset The calibrated and validated WRF model is then used to dynamically downscale eight different future climate projections over the Gediz Basin to a much finer resolution (6 km), which is more appropriate for the hydrologic modeling of the basin. These climate projections are from four Coupled Model Intercomparison Project Phase 5 (CMIP5) Global Climate Models (GCMs), namely, CCSM4, GFDL-ESM2M, HadGEM2-ES, and MIROC5, under two IPCC (The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change) representative concentration pathway scenarios (RCP4.5 and RCP8.5). The outputs from the WRF model are then input into the WEHY model, which is calibrated and validated over the basin, to simulate the hydrological processes within the basin and to obtain the projected future inflows into the Demirkopru Reservoir. Results of the future analysis over the 21st century (2017-2100) are then compared to the historical values (1985-2012) to investigate the impacts of future climate change on the hydroclimatology of the Gediz Basin.

FALSE,123,Medium-term storage volume prediction for optimum reservoir management: A hybrid data-driven approach,"A hybrid regressive and probabilistic model was developed that is able to forecast, six weeks ahead, the storage volume of Little Nerang dam. This is a small elevated Australian drinking water reservoir, gravity fed to a nearby water treatment plant while a lower second main water supply source (Hinze dam) requires considerable pumping. The model applies a Monte Carlo approach combined with nonlinear threshold autoregressive models using the seasonal streamflow forecasts from the Bureau of Meteorology as input and it was validated over different historical conditions. Treatment operators can use the model for quantifying depletion rates and spill likelihood for the forthcoming six weeks, based on the seasonal climatic conditions and different intake scenarios. Greater utilization of the Little Nerang reservoir source means a reduced supply requirement from the Hinze dam source that needs considerable energy costs for pumping, leading to a lower cost water supply solution for the region.

FALSE,124,A novel hybrid model for water quality prediction based on synchrosqueezed wavelet transform technique and improved long short-term memory,"Predicting water quality accurately is of utmost importance in water resource management. This study focuses on the prediction of water quality parameters such as the dissolved oxygen (DO) in the watershed system. The traditional recurrent neural networks (RNNs) suffer from gradient disappearance or explosion and inability to solve the problem of long-time dependence, and their practical applications are limited. To overcome this drawback, an improved long short-term memory (LSTM) model was proposed to improve the model's performance. In addition, to overcome nonstationarity, randomness, and nonlinearity of the water quality parameters data, a hybrid model that recruits synchrosqueezed wavelet transform (SWT) to denoise the original data was adopted. A novel metaheuristic optimization algorithm, the improved sparrow search algorithm (ISSA) combining Cauchy mutation and opposition-based learning (OBL) was also implemented to compute the optimal parameter values for the LSTM model. The proposed hybrid model was evaluated using an original weekly water quality parameters series, from 1/2010-12/2016, measured at the Yongding River and Gangnan gauging stations in the Haihe River Basin, China. The standalone LSTM, ISSA-LSTM, SWT-LSTM, support vector regression (SVR), and back propagation neural network (BPNN) were adopted as comparative forecast models using the same dataset. The results demonstrate that the addressed model, combining the strong noise-resistant robustness of the SWT and the nonlinear mapping of the LSTM, has the best prediction performance among the peer models at two gauging stations. The proposed hybrid model can be used as an alternative framework for water quality prediction, which can provide decision-making basis for comprehensive water quality management and pollutant control in the basin.",https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jhydrol.2021.126879,10.1016/j.jhydrol.2021.126879,"Song, Chenguang; Yao, Leihua; Hua, Chengya; Ni, Qihang",JOURNAL OF HYDROLOGY,SWT; ISSA; Water quality prediction; Ensemble learning; Hybrid model,RIVER-BASINS,NA,ELSEVIER,AMSTERDAM,"RADARWEG 29, 1043 NX AMSTERDAM, NETHERLANDS",0022-1694,1879-2707,NA,J HYDROL,J.

FALSE,126,Operational hydrometeorological forecast at EDF-DTG-recent progress and current situation in 2018,"To help managing the floods but also to optimize its hydroelectric production, EDF set up internal hydrometeorological centers in the 1970s to monitor flows and produce hydrometeorological forecasts. Since their creation, these centers have seen their activity evolve, integrating new challenges over the years, taking advantage of methodological advances made, implementing new organizations while developing new distribution supports and improving communication. The first step of the operational forecast chain is the analysis of observation data, either climatologic or hydrologic. Then, after a study of the meteorological context, allowing the forecasters to evaluate the uncertainties, they build a precipitation and air temperature scenario to feed the hydrological model. Through this rainfall-runoff model, a streamflow forecast is obtained, that can still be expertized before diffusion to the end-user. Probabilistic daily forecasts at 14 days, statistically calibrated, are automatically elaborated. Then, these are refined by deformation of distribution's synthetic variables. Very useful for various uses, these forecasts allow, a minima, an anticipated detection of a flood event risk of occurrence. In most cases, daily streamfiow forecast is sufficient for reservoir volume management, but in case of a rapid evolution, the hourly forecast can be helpful. Thus, the generalization of hourly flow forecast is a major stake for EDF. It results in: (i) the design of an hydrological model adapted to this time step, whose free parameters are then calibrated on more than 200 catchments; and (ii) an enriched communication to represent uncertainties on flood dynamic, volumes, gradients and maximal values of forecasted streamfiow. The hourly forecasts are then widely diffused to the end-users. At the same time, in 2008, a precise communication protocol, based on probabilities, has been conceived by EDF to warn in anticipation the dam managers of a potential threshold overrun. Thus, the expressions Fort Risque (greater risk) and Risque (risk) were used, communicated and explained, and are today an integral part of the diffused information. So, the hydrometeorological forecast is in permanent evolution at EDF. The next challenges are (i) the realization of expertized probabilistic hourly forecasts and (ii) the production of a more significant number of forecasts (currently 30,000 forecasts a year) answering the end-user expectations, mainly in flood period.",https://doi.org/10.1051/lhb/2019014,10.1051/lhb/2019014,"Moulin, Letitia; Abonnel, Alain; Puygrenier, Damien; Valery, Audrey; Garcon, Remy",HOUILLE BLANCHE-REVUE INTERNATIONALE DE L EAU,real-time streamflow forecast; floods; flow monitoring; probabilistic forecasts; hourly forecast; communication of information,NA,NA,EDP SCIENCES S A,LES ULIS CEDEX A,"17, AVE DU HOGGAR, PA COURTABOEUF, BP 112, F-91944 LES ULIS CEDEX A, FRANCE",0018-6368,1958-5551,NA,HOUILLE BLANCHE,Houille Blanche-Rev.

FALSE,127,Projected impacts of climate change on stream salmonids with implications for resilience-based management,"The sustainability of freshwater fisheries is increasingly affected by climate warming, habitat alteration, invasive species and other drivers of global change. The State of Michigan, USA, contains ecologically, socioeconomically valuable coldwater stream salmonid fisheries that are highly susceptible to these ecological alterations. Thus, there is a need for future management approaches that promote resilient stream ecosystems that absorb change amidst disturbances. Fisheries professionals in Michigan are responding to this need by designing a comprehensive management plan for stream brook charr (Salvelinus fontinalis), brown trout (Salmo trutta) and rainbow trout (Oncorhynchus mykiss) populations. To assist in developing such a plan, we used stream-specific regression models to forecast thermal habitat suitability in streams throughout Michigan from 2006 to 2056 under different predicted climate change scenarios. As baseflow index (i.e., relative groundwater input) increased, stream thermal sensitivity (i.e., relative susceptibility to temperature change) decreased. Thus, the magnitude of temperature warming and frequency of thermal habitat degradation were lowest in streams with the highest baseflow indices. Thermal habitats were most suitable in rainbow trout streams as this species has a wider temperature range for growth (12.0-22.5 degrees C) compared to brook charr (11.0-20.5 degrees C) and brown trout (12.0-20.0 degrees C). Our study promotes resilience-based salmonid management by providing a methodology for stream temperature and thermal habitat suitability prediction. Fisheries professionals can use this approach to protect coldwater habitats and drivers of stream cooling and ultimately conserve resilient salmonid populations amidst global change.",https://doi.org/10.1111/eff.12267,10.1111/eff.12267,"Carlson, Andrew K.; Taylor, William W.; Schlee, Kelsey M.; Zorn, Troy G.; Infante, Dana M.",ECOLOGY OF FRESHWATER FISH,brook charr; brown trout; rainbow trout; Michigan; temperature; resilience,GROUNDWATER TEMPERATURE RESPONSE; LAURENTIAN GREAT-LAKES; WATER TEMPERATURE; SALVELINUS-FONTINALIS; BROOK CHARR; MICHIGAN; GROWTH; TROUT; RIVER; HABITAT,NA,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0906-6691,1600-0633,NA,ECOL FRESHW FISH,Ecol.

FALSE,128,State updating and calibration period selection to improve dynamic monthly streamflow forecasts for an environmental flow management application,"Monthly to seasonal streamflow forecasts provide useful information for a range of water resource management and planning applications. This work focuses on improving such forecasts by considering the following two aspects: (1) state updating to force the models to match observations from the start of the forecast period, and (2) selection of a shorter calibration period that is more representative of the forecast period, compared to a longer calibration period traditionally used. The analysis is undertaken in the context of using streamflow forecasts for environmental flow water management of an open channel drainage network in southern Australia. Forecasts of monthly streamflow are obtained using a conceptual rainfall-runoff model combined with a post-processor error model for uncertainty analysis. This model set-up is applied to two catchments, one with stronger evidence of non-stationarity than the other. A range of metrics are used to assess different aspects of predictive performance, including reliability, sharpness, bias and accuracy. The results indicate that, for most scenarios and metrics, state updating improves predictive performance for both observed rainfall and forecast rainfall sources. Using the shorter calibration period also improves predictive performance, particularly for the catchment with stronger evidence of non-stationarity. The results highlight that a traditional approach of using a long calibration period can degrade predictive performance when there is evidence of non-stationarity.

This study presents a novel application of four advanced artificial intelligence models namely the Minimax Probability Machine Regression (MPMR), Relevance Vector Machine (RVM), Gaussian Process Regression (GPR) and Extreme Learning Machine (ELM) for forecasting lake level fluctuation in Lake Huron utilizing historical datasets. The MPMR is a probabilistic framework that employed Mercer Kernels to achieve nonlinear regression models. The GPR, which is a probabilistic technique used tractable Bayesian framework for generalization of multivariate distribution of input samples to vast dimensional space. The ELM is a capable algorithm-based model for the implementation of the single-layer feed-forward neural network. The RVM demonstrate depends on the specification of the Bayesian method on a linear model with proper preceding that results in demonstration of sparse. The recommended techniques were tested to evaluate the current lake water-level trend monthly from the historical datasets at four previous time steps. The Lake Huron levels from 1918 to 1993 was managed for the training phase, and the rest of data (from 1994 to 2013) was used for testing. Considering the monthly and annually previous time steps, six models were introduced and found that the best results are achieved for a model with (t-1, t-2, t-3, t-12) as input combinations. The results show that all models can forecast the lake levels precisely.

The objective of this paper is to characterize uncertainty induced to water temperature forecasts by meteorological inputs in two hydrological contexts. Daily ensemble water temperature forecasts were produced using the CEQUEAU model for the Nechako (regulated) and Southwest Miramichi (natural) Rivers for 1-5-day horizons. The results demonstrate that a larger uncertainty is propagated to the thermal forecast in the unregulated river (0.92-3.14 degrees C) than on the regulated river (0.73-2.29 degrees C). Better performances were observed on the Nechako with a mean continuous ranked probability score (MCRPS) <0.85 degrees C for all horizons compared to the Southwest Miramichi (MCRPS approximate to 1 degrees C).

FALSE,136,Variance analysis of forecasted streamflow maxima in a wet temperate climate,"Coupling global climate models, hydrologic models and extreme value analysis provides a method to forecast streamflow maxima, however the elusive variance structure of the results hinders confidence in application. Directly correcting the bias of forecasts using the relative change between forecast and control simulations has been shown to marginalize hydrologic uncertainty, reduce model bias, and remove systematic variance when predicting mean monthly and mean annual streamflow, prompting our investigation for maxima streamflow. We assess the variance structure of streamflow maxima using realizations of emission scenario, global climate model type and project phase, downscaling methods, bias correction, extreme value methods, and hydrologic model inputs and parameterization. Results show that the relative change of streamflow maxima was not dependent on systematic variance from the annual maxima versus peak over threshold method applied, albeit we stress that researchers strictly adhere to rules from extreme value theory when applying the peak over threshold method. Regardless of which method is applied, extreme value model fitting does add variance to the projection, and the variance is an increasing function of the return period. Unlike the relative change of mean streamflow, results show that the variance of the maxima's relative change was dependent on all climate model factors tested as well as hydrologic model inputs and calibration. Ensemble projections forecast an increase of streamflow maxima for 2050 with pronounced forecast standard error, including an increase of +30 (+/- 21), +38(+/- 34) and +51(+/- 85)% for 2, 20 and 100 year streamflow events for the wet temperate region studied. The variance of maxima projections was dominated by climate model factors and extreme value analyses. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V.

The BJP model uses a log-sinh transformation to normalize the raw forecasts and corresponding observations, and uses a bivariate Gaussian distribution to characterize the dependence relationship. The posterior distribution of the transformation parameters is inferenced through Metropolis Monte Carlo Markov chain sampling; it generates unbiased probabilistic forecasts that account for uncertainties from all sources. The BJP is used to post-processing raw daily forecasts of dissolved oxygen (DO), ammonium nitrogen (NH), total phosphorus (TP) and total nitrogen (TN) concentrations of Lake Chaohu, the fifth largest lake in China with lead times from 0 to 5 days. Results suggest that an average 93.1% forecast bias has been removed by BJP. The root mean square error in probability skill scores range from 5.8% for NH to 68.2% for TP, and the nonparametric bootstrapping test suggests that 67.7% forecasts are significantly improved averaged across all sampling sites, water quality parameters and lead times. The probabilities of the calibrated forecasts are reasonably consistent with the observed relative frequencies, and have appropriate spread and thus correctly quantify forecast uncertainty. The BJP post-processing method used in this study can be a useful operational tool that help to better realize the potential of water quality forecasts derived from dynamical models.

FALSE,145,Forecast of winter low flows in a cold-region river under the impact of climate warming,"Changes in winter low flow (WLF) in cold-region rivers affect engineering design, water quality, and river ecosystem health. This paper aims to quantify to what extent WLF will change under climate warming and to propose a practical forecasting model for WLF predictions. The new concept of cumulative watershed temperature (CWT) is used as a convenient lumped surrogate for complicated hydrological processes that influence WLF. Statistical analyses of century-long flow data from the Fraser River in British Columbia, Canada show a strong dependence of WLF on CWT. In winter season, time series of CWT and WLF are shown to each divide into a falling and a rising limb at the data point of their lowest values, being -358 degrees C and 827 m3/s (historical averages), respectively. The falling and rising limbs describe the cumulative freezing and thawing effects of air temperatures fluctuating around the freezing point on WLF changes. The correlation between CWT and WLF (time series) data points on the rising limbs forms the forecasting model, expressing WLF as a function of CWT in terms of their z-scores. The model takes input of Global Circulation Model (GCM) projections of temperature increases by the end of 21st century under different Representative Concentration Pathways (RCPs), and predicts changes of Fraser River WLF from the historical average. RCP4.5 causes a 22.6% increase (ensemble average from six GCMs). RCP8.5 increases WLF by 20% (for some future years) to 44% (for others).

FALSE,149,Projected increases and shifts in rain-on-snow flood risk over western North America,"Destructive and costly flooding can occur when warm storm systems deposit substantial rain on extensive snowcover(1-6), as observed in February 2017 with the Oroville Dam crisis in California(7). However, decision-makers lack guidance on how such rain-on-snow (ROS) flood risk may respond to climate change. Here, daily ROS events with flood-generating potential(8) are simulated over western North America for a historical (2000-2013) and future (forced under Representative Concentration Pathway 8.5(9)) period with the Weather Research and Forecasting model; 4 km resolution allows the basin-scale ROS flood risk to be assessed. In the warmer climate, we show that ROS becomes less frequent at lower elevations due to snowpack declines, particularly in warmer areas (for example, the Pacific maritime region). By contrast, at higher elevations where seasonal snowcover persists, ROS becomes more frequent due to a shift from snowfall to rain. Accordingly, the water available for runoff(10) increases for 55% of western North American river basins, with corresponding increases in flood risk of 20-200%, the greatest changes of which are projected for the Sierra Nevada, the Colorado River headwaters and the Canadian Rocky Mountains. Thus, flood control and water resource planning must consider ROS to fully quantify changes in flood risk with anthropogenic warming.",https://doi.org/10.1038/s41558-018-0236-4,10.1038/s41558-018-0236-4,"Musselman, Keith N.; Lehner, Flavio; Ikeda, Kyoko; Clark, Martyn P.; Prein, Andreas F.; Liu, Changhai; Barlage, Mike; Rasmussen, Roy",NATURE CLIMATE CHANGE,NA,CLIMATE; EVENTS; WATER; PRECIPITATION; RUNOFF; SIMULATION; IMPACTS; BALANCE; ENERGY,NA,NATURE PORTFOLIO,BERLIN,"HEIDELBERGER PLATZ 3, BERLIN, 14197, GERMANY",1758-678X,1758-6798,NA,NAT CLIM CHANGE,Nat.

FALSE,153,Variational Bayesian Neural Network for Ensemble Flood Forecasting,"Disastrous floods are destructive and likely to cause widespread economic losses. An understanding of flood forecasting and its potential forecast uncertainty is essential for water resource managers. Reliable forecasting may provide future streamflow information to assist in an assessment of the benefits of reservoirs and the risk of flood disasters. However, deterministic forecasting models are not able to provide forecast uncertainty information. To quantify the forecast uncertainty, a variational Bayesian neural network (VBNN) model for ensemble flood forecasting is proposed in this study. In VBNN, the posterior distribution is approximated by the variational distribution, which can avoid the heavy computational costs in the traditional Bayesian neural network. To transform the model parameters' uncertainty into the model output uncertainty, a Monte Carlo sample is applied to give ensemble forecast results. The proposed method is verified by a flood forecasting case study on the upper Yangtze River. A point forecasting model neural network and two probabilistic forecasting models, including hidden Markov Model and Gaussian process regression, are also applied to compare with the proposed model. The experimental results show that the VBNN performs better than other comparable models in terms of both accuracy and reliability.

Especially the usage of deterministic and probabilistic forecasts with sometimes widely divergent predicted future streamflow values makes it even more complicated for decision makers to sift out the relevant information. In this study multiple streamflow forecast information will be aggregated based on several different predictive distributions, and quantile forecasts. For this combination the Bayesian model averaging (BMA) approach, the nonhomogeneous Gaussian regression (NGR), also known as the ensemble model output statistic (EMOS) techniques, and a novel method called Beta-transformed linear pooling (BLP) will be applied. By the help of the quantile score (QS) and the continuous ranked probability score (CRPS), the combination results for the Sihl River in Switzerland with about 5 years of forecast data will be compared and the differences between the raw and optimally combined forecasts will be highlighted.

Real time control decisions suffer from streamflow forecast uncertainty. This study aims to use Probabilistic Streamflow Forecasts (PSFs) having a lead-time up to 48 h as input for the recurrent reservoir operation problem. A related technique for decision making is multi-stage stochastic optimization using scenario trees, referred to as Tree-based Model Predictive Control (TB-MPC). Deterministic Streamflow Forecasts (DSFs) are provided by applying random perturbations on perfect data. PSFs are synthetically generated from DSFs by a new approach which explicitly presents dynamic uncertainty evolution. We assessed different variables in the generation of stochasticity and compared the results using different scenarios. The developed real-time hourly flood control was applied to a test case which had limited reservoir storage and restricted downstream condition. According to hindcasting closed-loop experiment results, TB-MPC outperforms the deterministic counterpart in terms of decreased downstream flood risk according to different independent forecast scenarios. TB-MPC was also tested considering different number of tree branches, forecast horizons, and different inflow conditions. We conclude that using synthetic PSFs in TB-MPC can provide more robust solutions against forecast uncertainty by resolution of uncertainty in trees.",https://doi.org/10.3390/w10030340,10.3390/w10030340,"Uysal, Goekcen; Alvarado-Montero, Rodolfo; Schwanenberg, Dirk; Sensoy, Aynur",WATER,reservoir operation; multi-stage stochastic optimization; TB-MPC; flood control; real-time control,SYNTHETIC STREAMFLOW GENERATION; TERM OPTIMAL OPERATION; MULTIRESERVOIR SYSTEMS; OPTIMIZATION; MANAGEMENT; ERRORS; ALGORITHMS; TAIWAN; FUTURE; RULES,NA,MDPI,BASEL,"ST ALBAN-ANLAGE 66, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND",NA,2073-4441,NA,WATER-SUI,Water,MAR,2018,10,3,NA,NA,340,NA
FALSE,165,Forecasting the future establishment of invasive alien freshwater fish species,"Invasive alien species constitute a major threat to the world's freshwater ecosystems. Human translocations as well as rising temperatures have allowed freshwater fish species to expand their distribution into novel ecosystems, often with negative effects on native biodiversity. Early intervention is key to restricting damage and further spread of invasive aliens. This makes identification of areas with high risk for the establishment of invasive alien species necessary in order to target monitoring and mitigation measures. Here, we model lake-specific likelihood of establishment of five freshwater fish species which are increasing their distribution in Norway. In order to establish the likelihood of establishment resulting from human translocation, environmental factors or natural dispersal from an established population, a suite of anthropogenic and environmental covariates were included as predictors. We used these models to create a future scenario which modelled establishment risk for these species over a 50-year time period. Connectivity of lakes to other extant populations and anthropogenic covariates influenced likelihood of establishment-and subsequently future establishment risk-the most across all species. The effects of temperature were variable, and for the most part had little effect on likelihood of establishment. Our results indicate that human behaviour, infrastructure development and alternations of watershed connectivity are more important than climate induced range shifts on a short to medium time horizon. Synthesis and applications. Our study demonstrates how risk assessments of invasive establishment can be synthesised based on readily available open data sources. This allows for the construction of tools to forecast invasion hotspots as a basis for designing mitigation actions, including early monitoring programs, horizon scanning initiatives and eradication measures. It also allows managers to determine where species are spreading as a result of direct human translocation, and where they are expanding as a result of increased temperatures.",https://doi.org/10.1111/1365-2664.13993,10.1111/1365-2664.13993,"Perrin, Sam Wenaas; Baerum, Kim Magnus; Helland, Ingeborg Palm; Finstad, Anders Gravbrot",JOURNAL OF APPLIED ECOLOGY,connectivity; forecasting; freshwater fish; invasive alien species,COMMUNITY STRUCTURE; CLIMATE-CHANGE; POPULATIONS; PREDICTION; TRANSPORT; PATHWAYS; SPREAD; SHAPE; RISK,NA,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0021-8901,1365-2664,NA,J APPL ECOL,J.

To this end, a regional hydrological ensemble prediction system (RHEPS) is assembled and implemented. The RHEPS in this case comprises the ensemble meteorological forcing, a distributed hydrological model, and a statistical postprocessor. As the meteorological forcing, precipitation, and near-surface temperature outputs from the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA)/National Centers for Environmental Prediction (NCEP) 11-member Global Ensemble Forecast System Reforecast, version 2 (GEFSRv2), are used. The Hydrology Laboratory Research Distributed Hydrologic Model (HL-RDHM) is used as the distributed hydrological model, and a statistical autoregressive model with an exogenous variable is used as the postprocessor. To verify streamflow forecasts from the RHEPS, eight river basins in the MAR are selected, ranging in drainage area from; 262 to 29 965 km(2) and covering some of the major rivers in the MAR. The verification results for the RHEPS show that, at the initial lead times (1-3 days), the hydrological uncertainties have more impact on forecast skill than the meteorological ones. The former become less pronounced, and the meteorological uncertainties dominate, across longer lead times (> 3 days). Nonetheless, the ensemble streamflow forecasts remain skillful for lead times of up to 7 days. Additionally, postprocessing increases forecast skills across lead times and spatial scales, particularly for the high-flow conditions.

FALSE,173,Differing roles of base and fast flow in ensemble seasonal streamflow forecasting: An experimental investigation,"Seasonal streamflow forecasting, which is important for water resources management, is generally a challenging task in hydrology. This paper focuses on the consideration of base and fast flow for the forecasting of seasonal streamflow. Taking the three tributaries of the Pearl River in South China as case study, five forecasting experiments, which forecast the average daily flow in the three-month period by using the average daily flow in the antecedent month, are devised to elucidate the different roles of base, fast, and total flow. The recursive digital filter (RDF) model is employed for the separation of base flow from fast flow; the Bayesian joint probability (BJP) model is applied to generate ensemble forecasts under cross validation; and the Schaake shuffle is used to establish temporal structure to link ensemble members when adding up forecasts of base flow and fast flow. Forecasts in the different experiments are evaluated in terms of bias, reliability, and skill, and the relationship between correlation coefficient and forecast skill is illustrated. The results show that unbiased and reliable seasonal forecasts are generally obtained in the experiments. Correlation coefficients of base flow are overall higher than those of total flow while correlation coefficients of fast flow are lower. Forecast skill tends to increase with correlation coefficient. Meanwhile, fast flow can lead to extremely large total flow in the antecedent month, which can substantially enlarge the forecasts and diminish the forecast skill when the corresponding observation is not as large. By contrast, base flow tends to always contribute to forecast skill. The separation of base flow from fast flow, which accounts for the different dynamical processes of fast and base flow, can reduce the impact of fast flow and improve the forecast skill of total flow.",https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jhydrol.2020.125272,10.1016/j.jhydrol.2020.125272,"Huang, Zeqing; Zhao, Tongtiegang; Liu, Yang; Zhang, Yongyong; Jiang, Tao; Lin, Kairong; Chen, Xiaohong",JOURNAL OF HYDROLOGY,Streamflow forecasting; Seasonal flow; Base flow; Fast flow; Forecast skill,RECURSIVE DIGITAL-FILTERS; CLIMATE FORECASTS; SCHAAKE SHUFFLE; RIVER-BASIN; MODELS; SEPARATION; PREDICTION; RAINFALL; PRECIPITATION; TEMPERATURE,NA,ELSEVIER,AMSTERDAM,"RADARWEG 29, 1043 NX AMSTERDAM, NETHERLANDS",0022-1694,1879-2707,NA,J HYDROL,J.

Results based on a forecast verification study based on 60 years of independent data show that NHMMs with two or three hidden states, employing the NINO3 climate index as exogenous variable, provides forecasts with an average value of the continuous ranked probability skill score of about 0.2-0.25, meaning that they are better than climatology.

In Australia, the Bayesian joint probability (BJP) statistical approach has been deployed by the Australian Bureau of Meteorology to provide seasonal streamflow forecasts across the country since 2010. Here we assess the BJP approach, using antecedent conditions and climate indices as predictors, to produce Kharif season (April-September) streamflow forecasts for inflow to Pakistan's two largest upper Indus Basin (UIB) water supply dams, Tarbela (on the Indus) and Mangla (on the Jhelum). For Mangla, we compare these BJP forecasts to (i) ensemble streamflow predictions (ESPs) from the snowmelt runoff model (SRM) and (ii) a hybrid approach using the BJP with SRM-ESP forecast means as an additional predictor. For Tarbela, we only assess BJP forecasts using antecedent and climate predictors as we did not have access to SRM for this location. Cross validation of the streamflow forecasts shows that the BJP approach using two predictors (March flow and an El Nino Southern Oscillation, ENSO, climate index) provides skilful probabilistic forecasts that are reliable in uncertainty spread for both Mangla and Tarbela. For Mangla, the SRM approach leads to forecasts that exhibit some bias and are unreliable in uncertainty spread, and the hybrid approach does not result in better forecast skill. Skill levels for Kharif (April-September), early Kharif (April-June) and late Kharif (July-September) BJP forecasts vary between the two locations. Forecasts for Mangla show high skill for early Kharif and moderate skill for all Kharif and late Kharif, whereas forecasts for Tarbela also show moderate skill for all Kharif and late Kharif, but low skill for early Kharif. The BJP approach is simple to apply, with small input data requirements and automated calibration and forecast generation.

FALSE,183,A First Look at Decadal Hydrological Predictability by Land Surface Ensemble Simulations,"The prediction of terrestrial hydrology at the decadal scale is critical for managing water resources in the face of climate change. Here we conducted an assessment by global land model simulations following the design of the fifth Coupled Model Intercomparison Project (CMIP5) decadal hindcast experiments, specifically testing for the sensitivity to perfect initial or boundary conditions. The memory for terrestrial water storage (TWS) is longer than 6 years over 11% of global land areas where the deep soil moisture and aquifer water have a long memory and a nonnegligible variability. Ensemble decadal predictions based on realistic initial conditions are skillful over 31%, 43%, and 59% of global land areas for TWS, deep soil moisture, and aquifer water, respectively. The fraction of skillful predictions for TWS increases by 10%-16% when conditioned on Pacific Decadal Oscillation and Atlantic Multidecadal Oscillation indices. This study provides a first look at decadal hydrological predictability, with an improved skill when incorporating low-frequency climate information. Plain Language Summary Decadal prediction, which was initially proposed to more accurately project near-term (e.g., 10-30 years) climate change by using the experiences in weather and seasonal climate forecasting, has raised a wide concern since the IPCC CMIP5 project. The climate community is now trying to transition the decadal prediction from a pure research to a quasi-real-time operational effort. However, very limited information is known about the decadal hydrological predictability over land, which is more relevant to the livelihood and stakeholders. Here we combine an ensemble simulation method that is widely used to assess seasonal hydrological predictability, with the experimental design of the CMIP5 decadal climate hindcasts, to provide a first look at decadal hydrological predictability and skill by carrying out over 2,000 years global land model simulations. We found skillful decadal prediction for terrestrial water storage over one third land areas where deep soil moisture and aquifer have a nonnegligible variability. And the skill can be further enhanced by incorporating low-frequency teleconnection information from Atlantic and Pacific Oceans.

As multiyear temperature predictions become more mainstream and skillful, guidance is needed to assist practitioners who wish to explore this maturing field. This paper demonstrates the process and considerations of incorporating multiyear temperature predictions into water resources planning. Multiyear temperature predictions from the Community Earth System Model Decadal Prediction Large Ensemble are presented as discrete and probabilistic products and are used to force two common hydrologic modeling approaches: conceptual and empirical. The approaches are demonstrated to simulate streamflow in the upper Colorado River basin watershed in Colorado, where diagnostics show that increasing temperatures are associated with decreasing streamflows. Using temperature information for lead years 2-6, two analyses are performed: (i) a retrospective hindcast for the climatological period (1981-2010) and (ii) a blind forecast for 2011-15. For the retrospective hindcast, including temperature information improved the percent error as compared with climatology. For the blind forecast, the multiyear temperature prediction for warming was skillful, but the corresponding multiyear average streamflow predictions from both approaches were counterintuitive: with the predicted warming, the multiyear average streamflow was predicted to be lower than the climatological mean; however, the observed multiyear average streamflow was higher than the climatological mean. This was due to above-average precipitation during the prediction time frame, particularly for one of the years. With that year removed, the multiyear streamflow average became lower than the climatological mean. Temperature provides a marginal source of streamflow predictability, but there will be substantial uncertainty until prediction skill for year-to-year climate variability, especially for precipitation, increases.",https://doi.org/10.1175/JAMC-D-20-0134.1,10.1175/JAMC-D-20-0134.1,"Towler, Erin; Yates, David",JOURNAL OF APPLIED METEOROLOGY AND CLIMATOLOGY,Streamflow; Climate prediction; Forecast verification; skill; Hydrologic models,MID-1970S SHIFT; CLIMATE; MODEL; DRIVEN; SKILL; CMIP5,NA,AMER METEOROLOGICAL SOC,BOSTON,"45 BEACON ST, BOSTON, MA 02108-3693 USA",1558-8424,1558-8432,NA,J APPL METEOROL CLIM,J.

During the 3-week experiment period, a total of nine NWS forecasters analyzed three retrospective flash flood events in archive mode. This study will describe specifically what information participants extracted from the WoFS-FLASH products during these three archived events, and how this type of information is expected to impact operational decision-making processes. Overall feedback from the testbed participants' evaluations show promise for the coupled NSSL WoFS-FLASH system probabilistic flash flood model guidance to enable earlier assessment and detection of flash flood threats and to advance the current warning lead time for these events.",https://doi.org/10.1175/JHM-D-19-0131.1,10.1175/JHM-D-19-0131.1,"Yussouf, Nusrat; Wilson, Katie A.; Martinaitis, Steven M.; Vergara, Humberto; Heinselman, Pam L.; Gourley, Jonathan J.",JOURNAL OF HYDROMETEOROLOGY,Hydrometeorology; Operational forecasting; Probabilistic Quantitative Precipitation Forecasting (PQPF); Cloud resolving models; Communications; decision making; Flood events,DATA ASSIMILATION; ENSEMBLE; VERIFICATION,NA,AMER METEOROLOGICAL SOC,BOSTON,"45 BEACON ST, BOSTON, MA 02108-3693 USA",1525-755X,1525-7541,NA,J HYDROMETEOROL,J.

FALSE,191,Temperature and hydrologic alteration predict the spread of invasive Largemouth Bass (Micropterus salmoides),"The successful establishment of an aquatic invasive alien species can be mediated by a suite of environmental factors, including climate and anthropogenic disturbance. Dams and reservoirs are thought to promote freshwater fish invasion success through hydrological alterations but the evidence for their role in the global invasion of Largemouth Bass (Micropterus salmoides) on a landscape scale is limited. Here, we examine the distribution of Largemouth Bass, one of the most widely introduced fish in the world, from the Iberian Peninsula using species distribution models (SDMs), including an ensemble forecast. We used these models to test the role of twelve environmental predictors expected to influence the distribution of Largemouth Bass, including the reservoir storage capacity at local and upstream reaches. We found that the predictive accuracy, based on AUC criteria, of the ensemble model was higher than any of the six individual SDMs for Largemouth Bass. The most influential predictor of bass distribution included in our model of the Iberian Peninsula was temperature, where warmer temperatures were generally associated with bass presence, and cooler temperatures with absence. In addition to warmer temperatures, increasing storage of local and upstream reservoirs increased predicted presence, suggesting an important role of reservoirs in mediating the invasive success of this fish. Our results indicate that although natural climatic factors may be crucial in the successful invasion of Largemouth Bass, hydrological alteration (e.g., regulated flow regimes and lentic habitats associated with dams and reservoirs) may be important. Understanding the drivers promoting the establishment of this global invader will be important in identifying areas at risk and in developing future efforts to control its spread, especially when those drivers are ongoing anthropogenic disturbances such as the construction and operation of dams and reservoirs.

FALSE,195,Bayesian Model Averaging: A Unique Model Enhancing Forecasting Accuracy for Daily Streamflow Based on Different Antecedent Time Series,"Streamflow forecasting is a vital task for hydrology and water resources engineering, and the different artificial intelligence (AI) approaches have been employed for this purposes until now. Additionally, the forecasting accuracy and uncertainty estimation are the meaningful assignments that need to be recognized. The addressed research investigates the potential of novel ensemble approach, Bayesian model averaging (BMA), in streamflow forecasting using daily time series data from two stations (i.e., Hongcheon and Jucheon), South Korea. Six categories (i.e., M1-M6) of input combination using different antecedent times were employed for streamflow forecasting. The outcomes of BMA model were compared with those of multivariate adaptive regression spline (MARS), M5 model tree (M5Tree), and Kernel extreme learning machines (KELM) models considering four assessment indexes, root mean square error (RMSE), Nash-Sutcliffe efficiency (NSE), correlation coefficient (R), and mean absolute error (MAE). The results revealed the superior accuracy of BMA model over three machine learning models in daily streamflow forecasting. Considering RMSE values among the best models during testing phase, the best BMA model (i.e., BMA2) enhanced the forecasting accuracy of MARS1, M5Tree4, and KELM3 models by 5.2%, 5.8%, and 3.4% in Hongcheon station. Additionally, the best BMA model (i.e., BMA1) improved the forecasting accuracy of MARS1, M5Tree1, and KELM1 models by 6.7%, 9.5%, and 3.7% in Jucheon station. In addition, the best BMA models in both stations allowed the uncertainty estimation, and produced higher uncertainty of peak flows compared to that of low flows. As one of the most robust and effective tools, therefore, the BMA model can be successfully employed for streamflow forecasting with different antecedent times.",https://doi.org/10.3390/su12229720,10.3390/su12229720,"Kim, Sungwon; Alizamir, Meysam; Kim, Nam Won; Kisi, Ozgur",SUSTAINABILITY,streamflow forecasting; Bayesian model averaging; multivariate adaptive regression spline; M5 model tree; Kernel extreme learning machines; South Korea,EXTREME LEARNING-MACHINE; ADAPTIVE REGRESSION SPLINES; ABSOLUTE ERROR MAE; NEURAL-NETWORKS; RIVER; RUNOFF; DECOMPOSITION; REGION; TREES; RMSE,NA,MDPI,BASEL,"ST ALBAN-ANLAGE 66, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND",NA,2071-1050,NA,SUSTAINABILITY-BASEL,Sustainability,NOV,2020,12,22,NA,NA,9720,NA

The potential for TWS from GRACE (Gravity Recovery and Climate Experiment) satellites to provide long-lead streamflow forecasting in adjacent lowlands during the low-flow season was assessed using the upper Yellow River as a case study. Two linear models were trained for forecasting monthly streamflow with and without TWS anomaly (TWSA) from 2002 to 2016. Results show that the model based on streamflow and TWSA is superior to the model based on streamflow alone at up to a five-month lead-time. The inclusion of TWSA reduced errors in streamflow forecasts by 25% to 50%, with 3-5-month lead-times, which represents the role of terrestrial hydrologic memory in streamflow changes during the low-flow season.

FALSE,202,Impacts of Future Climate Projections on the Water Balance of the Gediz Basin in Turkey,"Located along the western coast of Turkey, the Gediz Basin counts on agriculture as its most important economic activity. Over the last few decades, the basin has been facing water-related problems, such as water scarcity and competing use of water. However, an investigation of possible future water demands and droughts is expected to be helpful for water managers dealing with the future water planning and management of the region. As such, this study aims at evaluating the future water balances occurring in the major reservoir of the basin during the 21s t century. For this purpose, four future water supply projections are generated using a hydroclimate modeling framework. This framework includes the coupling of a regional climate model, the weather research and forecasting (WRF) model, and a fully physically-based hydrologic model, the watershed environmental hydrology (WEHY) model, under two IPCC representative concentration pathway scenarios (RCP4.5 and RCP8.5) of a CMIP5 global climate model, HadGEM2-ES.

FALSE,204,Sensitivity of streamflow simulation in the Delaware River Basin to forecasted land-cover change for 2030 and 2060,"In order to simulate the potential effect of forecasted land-cover change on streamflow and water availability, there has to be confidence that the hydrologic model used is sensitive to small changes in land cover (<10%) and that this land-cover change exceeds the inherent uncertainty in forecasted conditions. To investigate this, a 26-year streamflow record was simulated for 33 basins (54-928 km(2)) in the Delaware River Basin using three dates of land cover: the 2011 National Land-Cover Dataset (Homer, Fry, & Barnes, ), 2030 land-cover conditions representing median values from 101 equally-likely forecasts, and 2060 land-cover conditions corresponding to the same iterations used to represent 2030. Streamflow was simulated using a process-based hydrologic model that includes both pervious and impervious methods as parameterized by three land-cover-based hydrologic response units (HRUs)-forested, agricultural, and developed land. Small, but significant differences in streamflow magnitude, variability, and seasonality were seen among the three time periods-2011, 2030, and 2060. Temporal differences were discernible from the range of conditions simulated with 101 equally likely forecasts for 2030. Development was co-located with the most frequent landscape components, as characterized by topographic wetness index, resulting in a change in hydrology for each HRU, highlighting that knowing the location of disturbance is key to understanding potential streamflow changes. These results show that streamflow simulation using regional calibration that incorporates land-cover-based HRUs can be sensitive to relatively small changes in land-cover and that temporal trends resulting from land-cover change can be isolated in order to evaluate other changes that might affect water resources.",https://doi.org/10.1002/hyp.13315,10.1002/hyp.13315,"Williamson, Tanja N.; Claggett, Peter",HYDROLOGICAL PROCESSES,environmental impacts; surface-water hydrology; water-resource management,CLIMATE; TRENDS; MODEL,NA,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0885-6087,1099-1085,NA,HYDROL PROCESS,Hydrol.

FALSE,207,Use of bias correction techniques to improve seasonal forecasts for reservoirs - A case-study in north western Mediterranean,"In this paper, we have compared different bias correction methodologies to assess whether they could be advantageous for improving the performance of a seasonal prediction model for volume anomalies in the Boadella reservoir (northwestern Mediterranean). The bias correction adjustments have been applied on precipitation and temperature from the European Centre for Middle-range Weather Forecasting System 4 (S4). We have used three bias correction strategies: two linear (mean bias correction, BC, and linear regression, LR) and one non-linear (Model Output Statistics analogs, MOS-analog). The results have been compared with climatology and persistence. The volume-anomaly model is a previously computed Multiple Linear Regression that ingests precipitation, temperature and in-flow anomaly data to simulate monthly volume anomalies. The potential utility for end-users has been assessed using economic value curve areas. We have studied the S4 hindcast period 1981-2010 for each month of the year and up to seven months ahead considering an ensemble of 15 members. We have shown that the MOS-analog and LR bias corrections can improve the original S4. The application to volume anomalies points towards the possibility to introduce bias correction methods as a tool to improve water resource seasonal forecasts in an end-user context of climate services. Particularly, the MOS-analog approach gives generally better results than the other approaches in late autumn and early winter. (c) 2017 Elsevier B.V.

FALSE,208,Leveraging multi-model season-ahead streamflow forecasts to trigger advanced flood preparedness in Peru,"Disaster planning has historically allocated minimal effort and finances toward advanced preparedness; however, evidence supports reduced vulnerability to flood events, saving lives and money, through appropriate early actions. Among other requirements, effective early action systems necessitate the availability of high-quality forecasts to inform decision making. In this study, we evaluate the ability of statistical and physically based season-ahead prediction models to appropriately trigger flood early preparedness actions based on a 75% or greater probability of surpassing the 80th percentile of historical seasonal streamflow for the floodprone Maranon River and Piura River in Peru. The statistical prediction model, developed in this work, leverages the asymmetric relationship between seasonal streamflow and the ENSO phenomenon. Additionally, a multi-model (least-squares combination) is also evaluated against current operational practices. The statistical prediction demonstrates superior performance compared to the physically based model for the Maranon River by correctly triggering preparedness actions in three out of four historical occasions, while both the statistical and multi-model predictions capture all four historical events when the required threshold excee-dance probability is reduced to 50 %, with only one false alarm. For the Piura River, the statistical model proves superior to all other approaches, correctly triggering 28% more often in the hindcast period. Continued efforts should focus on applying this season-ahead prediction framework to additional flood-prone locations where early actions may be warranted and current forecast capacity is limited.",https://doi.org/10.5194/nhess-21-2215-2021,10.5194/nhess-21-2215-2021,"Keating, Colin; Lee, Donghoon; Bazo, Juan; Block, Paul",NATURAL HAZARDS AND EARTH SYSTEM SCIENCES,NA,EL-NINO; CLIMATE FORECASTS; PREDICTION; RAINFALL; IMPROVEMENTS; PATTERNS,NA,COPERNICUS GESELLSCHAFT MBH,GOTTINGEN,"BAHNHOFSALLEE 1E, GOTTINGEN, 37081, GERMANY",1561-8633,1684-9981,NA,NAT HAZARD EARTH SYS,Nat.

Conventional hydrological parameter calibration is based on an objective function without consideration for forecast performance during lead-time periods. A novel objective function, i.e., minimizing the sum of the squared errors between forecasted and observed streamflow during multiple lead times, is proposed to calibrate hydrological parameters for improved forecasting. China's Baiyunshan Reservoir basin was selected as a case study, and the Xinanjiang model was used. The proposed method provided better results for peak flows, in terms of the value and occurrence time, than the conventional method. Specifically, the qualified rate of peak flow for 4-, 5-, and 6-h lead times in the proposed method were 69.2%, 53.8%, and 38.5% in calibration, and 60%, 40%, and 20% in validation, respectively. This compares favorably with the corresponding values for the conventional method, which were 53.8%, 15.4%, and 7.7% in calibration, and 20%, 20%, and 0% in validation, respectively. Uncertainty analysis revealed that the proposed method caused less parameter uncertainty than the conventional method.

FALSE,219,Skilful seasonal forecasts of streamflow over Europe?,"This paper considers whether there is any added value in using seasonal climate forecasts instead of historical meteorological observations for forecasting streamflow on seasonal timescales over Europe. A Europe-wide analysis of the skill of the newly operational EFAS (European Flood Awareness System) seasonal streamflow forecasts (produced by forcing the Lisflood model with the ECMWF System 4 seasonal climate forecasts), benchmarked against the ensemble streamflow prediction (ESP) forecasting approach (produced by forcing the Lisflood model with historical meteorological observations), is undertaken. The results suggest that, on average, the System 4 seasonal climate forecasts improve the streamflow predictability over historical meteorological observations for the first month of lead time only (in terms of hindcast accuracy, sharpness and overall performance). However, the predictability varies in space and time and is greater in winter and autumn. Parts of Europe additionally exhibit a longer predictability, up to 7 months of lead time, for certain months within a season. In terms of hindcast reliability, the EFAS seasonal streamflow hindcasts are on average less skilful than the ESP for all lead times. The results also highlight the potential usefulness of the EFAS seasonal streamflow forecasts for decision-making (measured in terms of the hindcast discrimination for the lower and upper terciles of the simulated streamflow). Although the ESP is the most potentially useful forecasting approach in Europe, the EFAS seasonal streamflow forecasts appear more potentially useful than the ESP in some regions and for certain seasons, especially in winter for almost 40 % of Europe. Patterns in the EFAS seasonal streamflow hindcast skill are however not mirrored in the System 4 seasonal climate hindcasts, hinting at the need for a better understanding of the link between hydrological and meteorological variables on seasonal timescales, with the aim of improving climate-model-based seasonal streamflow forecasting.",https://doi.org/10.5194/hess-22-2057-2018,10.5194/hess-22-2057-2018,"Arnal, Louise; Cloke, Hannah L.; Stephens, Elisabeth; Wetterhall, Fredrik; Prudhomme, Christel; Neumann, Jessica; Krzeminski, Blazej; Pappenberger, Florian",HYDROLOGY AND EARTH SYSTEM SCIENCES,NA,PROBABILISTIC FORECASTS; CLIMATE FORECASTS; WATER-RESOURCES; UNITED-STATES; SYSTEM; RIVER; PREDICTABILITY; DROUGHT; MODEL; TIME,NA,COPERNICUS GESELLSCHAFT MBH,GOTTINGEN,"BAHNHOFSALLEE 1E, GOTTINGEN, 37081, GERMANY",1027-5606,1607-7938,NA,HYDROL EARTH SYST SC,Hydrol.

However, systematic studies have not been performed to examine binary metaheuristic wrapper-based input variable selection (BMWIVS) in real-world streamflow forecasting. In this study, we explored binary metaheuristic-based shallow machine learning wrappers for one-step monthly streamflow forecasting using local weather information and global climate indices from three catchments with different hydroclimatic conditions. First, the maximal information coefficient (MIC) was employed to investigate the correlations among the forecasting target, streamflow and candidate input variables, which included both local and global climate information. Then, the BMWIVS models obtained by combining eight binary metaheuristic algorithms, five commonly used shallow machine learning algorithms, two combined filter-based input variable selection (FIVS) methods, and two forecasting methods were examined. Finally, the performance of each model was compared with the performance of typical benchmark models, including the univariate seasonal autoregressive integrated moving average model, five machine learning algorithms with no input variable selection, and five machine learning algorithms that use five different FIVS methods. The experimental results emphasized three significant findings. First, an appropriate input variable selection method should be selected in practice because several examined wrappers were inferior to the benchmark models. Second, the BMWIVS model that combined the regularized extreme learning machine method, binary gray wolf optimizer, FIVS results-based initialization method, and forecasted values averaged over multiple runs yielded the best performance in the three cases studied. Third, the correlations in terms of the MIC between the global climate indices and streamflow were lower than those between local weather information and streamflow, and the best wrapper and FIVS would select more local weather information variables than global climate index variables, which suggests that global climate information can be complementary to local weather information for one-step monthly streamflow forecasting.

FALSE,233,An intercomparison of approaches for improving operational seasonal streamflow forecasts,"For much of the last century, forecasting centers around the world have offered seasonal streamflow predictions to support water management. Recent work suggests that the two major avenues to advance seasonal predictability are improvements in the estimation of initial hydrologic conditions (IHCs) and the incorporation of climate information. This study investigates the marginal benefits of a variety of methods using IHCs and/or climate information, focusing on seasonal water supply forecasts (WSFs) in five case study watersheds located in the US Pacific Northwest region. We specify two benchmark methods that mimic standard operational approaches - statistical regression against IHCs and model-based ensemble streamflow prediction (ESP) - and then systematically intercompare WSFs across a range of lead times. Additional methods include (i) statistical techniques using climate information either from standard indices or from climate reanalysis variables and (ii) several hybrid/hierarchical approaches harnessing both land surface and climate predictability. In basins where atmospheric tele-connection signals are strong, and when watershed predictability is low, climate information alone provides considerable improvements. For those basins showing weak tele-connections, custom predictors from reanalysis fields were more effective in forecast skill than standard climate indices. ESP predictions tended to have high correlation skill but greater bias compared to other methods, and climate predictors failed to substantially improve these deficiencies within a trace weighting framework. Lower complexity techniques were competitive with more complex methods, and the hierarchical expert regression approach introduced here (hierarchical ensemble streamflow prediction - HESP) provided a robust alternative for skillful and reliable water supply forecasts at all initialization times. Three key findings from this effort are (1) objective approaches supporting methodologically consistent hindcasts open the door to a broad range of beneficial forecasting strategies; (2) the use of climate predictors can add to the seasonal forecast skill available from IHCs; and (3) sample size limitations must be handled rigorously to avoid over-trained forecast solutions. Overall, the results suggest that despite a rich, long heritage of operational use, there remain a number of compelling opportunities to improve the skill and value of seasonal streamflow predictions.",https://doi.org/10.5194/hess-21-3915-2017,10.5194/hess-21-3915-2017,"Mendoza, Pablo A.; Wood, Andrew W.; Clark, Elizabeth; Rothwell, Eric; Clark, Martyn P.; Nijssen, Bart; Brekke, Levi D.; Arnold, Jeffrey R.",HYDROLOGY AND EARTH SYSTEM SCIENCES,NA,WESTERN UNITED-STATES; EL-NINO; CLIMATE; PREDICTION; SYSTEM; PREDICTABILITY; PRECIPITATION; VARIABILITY; REGRESSION; FRAMEWORK,NA,COPERNICUS GESELLSCHAFT MBH,GOTTINGEN,"BAHNHOFSALLEE 1E, GOTTINGEN, 37081, GERMANY",1027-5606,1607-7938,NA,HYDROL EARTH SYST SC,Hydrol.

FALSE,235,Real-time optimization of a large-scale reservoir operation in Thailand using adaptive inflow prediction with medium-range ensemble precipitation forecasts,"Study region: The Sirikit Dam in the Nan River Basin is located on a main tributary of the Chao Phraya River in Thailand. Study focus: This study investigates forecasting river flows and real-time optimization of dam release using a distributed hydrological model with ensemble weather forecasting for reservoir operations which provide hydropower and irrigation facilities in Thailand during a case study of the 2019 drought event. Medium-range ensemble precipitation forecasts were employed using a hydrological model to predict the real-time reservoir inflow. Real-time optimization of the water release strategy determined a week in advance with an effective initial condition for hydropower generation and irrigation was conducted with different scenarios using dynamic programming considering inflow predictions. New hydrological insights for the region: The medium-range ensemble precipitation forecast con-ducted by the European Centre for Medium Range Weather Forecasts was used to quantify pre-cipitation for the study basin. The ensemble precipitation forecast with the hydrological model was employed for inflow prediction of the study basin which was located in a tropical climate with a distinct wet and dry season. The initial conditions of the hydrological model largely influenced the real-time inflow forecast. To determine the initial conditions of the model, the empirical data assimilation considering a drainage area factor was utilized and observed pre-cipitation data were used for model input forcing data during the initial analysis period. This method improved the reservoir inflow prediction and real-time reservoir optimization using dynamic programming with considering ensemble forecasts provided more efficient operating decisions than employing historical data. The resulting information will be useful for water resource management, which may be adapted to other basins in the study region.",https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ejrh.2021.100939,10.1016/j.ejrh.2021.100939,"Meema, Thatkiat; Tachikawa, Yasuto; Ichikawa, Yutaka; Yorozu, Kazuaki",JOURNAL OF HYDROLOGY-REGIONAL STUDIES,Ensemble inflow forecasting; Data assimilation; Distributed hydrologic model; Reservoir optimization; Dynamic programing; Thailand,CHAO-PHRAYA RIVER; ECONOMIC VALUE; CLIMATE; MULTIMODEL; DISCHARGE; FLOODS; MODEL; BASIN,NA,ELSEVIER,AMSTERDAM,"RADARWEG 29, 1043 NX AMSTERDAM, NETHERLANDS",NA,2214-5818,NA,J HYDROL-REG STUD,J.

FALSE,238,Forecasted range shifts of arid-land fishes in response to climate change,"Climate change is poised to alter the distributional limits, center, and size of many species. Traits may influence different aspects of range shifts, with trophic generality facilitating shifts at the leading edge, and greater thermal tolerance limiting contractions at the trailing edge. The generality of relationships between traits and range shifts remains ambiguous however, especially for imperiled fishes residing in xeric riverscapes. Our objectives were to quantify contemporary fish distributions in the Lower Colorado River Basin, forecast climate change by 2085 using two general circulation models, and quantify shifts in the limits, center, and size of fish elevational ranges according to fish traits. We examined relationships among traits and range shift metrics either singly using univariate linear modeling or combined with multivariate redundancy analysis. We found that trophic and dispersal traits were associated with shifts at the leading and trailing edges, respectively, although projected range shifts were largely unexplained by traits. As expected, piscivores and omnivores with broader diets shifted upslope most at the leading edge while more specialized invertivores exhibited minimal changes. Fishes that were more mobile shifted upslope most at the trailing edge, defying predictions. No traits explained changes in range center or size. Finally, current preference explained multivariate range shifts, as fishes with faster current preferences exhibited smaller multivariate changes. Although range shifts were largely unexplained by traits, more specialized invertivorous fishes with lower dispersal propensity or greater current preference may require the greatest conservation efforts because of their limited capacity to shift ranges under climate change.",https://doi.org/10.1007/s11160-017-9479-9,10.1007/s11160-017-9479-9,"Whitney, James E.; Whittier, Joanna B.; Paukert, Craig P.; Olden, Julian D.; Strecker, Angela L.",REVIEWS IN FISH BIOLOGY AND FISHERIES,Climate change; Imperiled fish; Nonnative fish; Range shifts; Rivers; Trait-based approach,FRESH-WATER FISHES; SPECIES TRAITS; PHYLOGENETIC CONSERVATISM; POTENTIAL IMPACTS; DISTRIBUTIONS; MARINE; RIVER; PREDICT; LIFE; VULNERABILITY,NA,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0960-3166,1573-5184,NA,REV FISH BIOL FISHER,Rev.

FALSE,241,Predicting current and future background ion concentrations in German surface water under climate change,"Salinization of surface waters is a global environmental issue that can pose a regional risk to freshwater organisms, potentially leading to high environmental and economic costs. Global environmental change including climate and land use change can increase the transport of ions into surface waters. We fit both multiple linear regression (LR) and random forest (RF) models on a large spatial dataset to predict Ca2+ (266 sites), Mg2+ (266 sites), and SO42- (357 sites) ion concentrations as well as electrical conductivity (EC-a proxy for total dissolved solids with 410 sites) in German running water bodies. Predictions in both types of models were driven by the major factors controlling salinity including geologic and soil properties, climate, vegetation and topography. The predictive power of the two types of models was very similar, with RF explaining 71-76% of the spatial variation in ion concentrations and LR explaining 70-75% of the variance. Mean squared errors for predictions were all smaller than 0.06. The factors most strongly associated with stream ion concentrations varied among models but rock chemistry and climate were the most dominant. The RF model was subsequently used to forecast the changes in EC that were likely to occur for the period of 2070 to 2100 in response to just climate change-i.e. no additional effects of other anthropogenic activities. The future forecasting shows approximately 10% and 15% increases in mean EC for representative concentration pathways 2.6 and 8.5 (RCP2.6 and RCP8.5) scenarios, respectively.

However, it is also one of the most important problems in hydrology due to its critical contribution in reducing economic and life losses. In many regions of the world, flood forecasting is one among the few feasible options to manage floods. Reliability of forecasts has increased in the recent years due to the integration of meteorological and hydrological modelling capabilities, improvements in data collection through satellite observations, and advancements in knowledge and algorithms for analysis and communication of uncertainties. The present paper reviews different aspects of flood forecasting, including the models being used, emerging techniques of collecting inputs and displaying results, uncertainties, and warnings.

FALSE,257,Fuzzy Postprocessing to Advance the Quality of Continental Seasonal Hydrological Forecasts for River Basin Management,"Streamflow forecasting services driven by seasonal meteorological forecasts from dynamic prediction systems deliver valuable information for decision-making in the water sector. Moving beyond the traditional river basin boundaries, large-scale hydrological models enable a coordinated, efficient, and harmonized anticipation and management of water-related risks (droughts, floods). However, the use of forecasts from such models at the river basin scale remains a challenge, depending on how the model reproduces the hydrological features of each particular river basin. Consequently, postprocessing of forecasts is a crucial step to ensure usefulness at the river basin scale. In this paper we present a methodology to postprocess seasonal streamflow forecasts from large-scale hydrological models and advance their quality for local applications. It consists of fuzzy logic systems that bias-adjust seasonal forecasts from a large-scale hydrological model by comparing its modeled streamflows with local observations. The methodology is demonstrated using forecasts from the pan-European hydrological model E-HYPE at the Jucar River basin (Spain). Fuzzy postprocessed forecasts are compared to postprocessed forecasts derived from a quantile mapping approach as a benchmark. Fuzzy postprocessing was able to provide skillful streamflow forecasts for the Jucar River basin, keeping most of the skill of raw E-HYPE forecasts and also outperforming quantile-mapping-based forecasts. The proposed methodology offers an efficient one-to-one mapping between large-scale modeled streamflows and basin-scale observations preserving its temporal dependence structure and can adapt its input set to increase the skill of postprocessed forecasts.",https://doi.org/10.1175/JHM-D-19-0266.1,10.1175/JHM-D-19-0266.1,"Macian-Sorribes, Hector; Pechlivanidis, Ilias; Crochemore, Louise; Pulido-Velazquez, Manuel",JOURNAL OF HYDROMETEOROLOGY,Seasonal forecasting; Hydrologic models; Mesoscale models,RESERVOIR OPERATION; DECISION-MAKING; MODEL; SYSTEM; STREAMFLOW; ENSEMBLE; PREDICTIONS; RULES; SKILL,NA,AMER METEOROLOGICAL SOC,BOSTON,"45 BEACON ST, BOSTON, MA 02108-3693 USA",1525-755X,1525-7541,NA,J HYDROMETEOROL,J.

FALSE,259,Decomposition ensemble model based on variational mode decomposition and long short-term memory for streamflow forecasting,"Reliable and accurate streamflow forecasting is vital for water resource management. Many streamflow prediction studies have demonstrated the excellent prediction ability of decomposition ensemble models. Several studies first extracted subsignals from a streamflow series and then split subsignals into training and validation sets to build prediction models, capturing some future information not available in practical streamflow forecasting. Alternatively, dividing a time series into training and validation sets first and later decomposing them into subsignals can expose the subsignals to the boundary effect, making predicting streamflow difficult. Furthermore, building one model for each subsignal is laborious and can cause error accumulation. Therefore, establishing a robust and efficient decomposition ensemble model without future information to predict highly nonstationary and nonlinear streamflow is challenging. Hence, a single-model forecasting (SF) scheme that assesses the validation distribution during the training stage to adapt to the boundary effect was designed. A SF scheme based on variational mode decomposition (VMD) and long short-term memory (LSTM), namely, SF-VMD-LSTM, was proposed to predict daily streamflow 1-7 days ahead. Non-decomposition-based and decomposition-ensemble-based LSTM models established using SF, multi-model ensemble forecasting (MEF) and SF with the most influential subsignals (SFMIS) and the ensemble empirical mode decomposition (EEMD) and discrete wavelet transform (DWT) were compared. Additionally, multi-model ensemble hindcasting (MEH), single-model hindcasting (SH) and SH with the most influential subsignals (SHMIS) were used as benchmarks to evaluate the forecasting schemes' adaptability to the boundary effect. Two daily streamflow series from Han River and Jing River, China, were investigated. The results indicate that (1) SF is more robust and efficient than MEF and SFMIS; (2) VMD performs better than EEMD and DWT; (3) SF-VMD-LSTM, with NSE values larger than 0.8 for almost all the prediction scenarios, outperformed other comparative models. Therefore, SF-VMD-LSTM is robust and efficient for forecasting highly nonstationary and nonlinear streamflow.",https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jhydrol.2020.124776,10.1016/j.jhydrol.2020.124776,"Zuo, Ganggang; Luo, Jungang; Wang, Ni; Lian, Yani; He, Xinxin",JOURNAL OF HYDROLOGY,Forecasting experiment; Hindcasting experiment; Decomposition and ensemble; Deep learning,ARTIFICIAL NEURAL-NETWORK; INCORRECT USAGE; HYBRID MODELS; RIVER FLOW; PREDICTION; WAVELET; RUNOFF; WATER; MACHINE; INFLOW,NA,ELSEVIER,AMSTERDAM,"RADARWEG 29, 1043 NX AMSTERDAM, NETHERLANDS",0022-1694,1879-2707,NA,J HYDROL,J.

FALSE,262,"Potential application of hydrological ensemble prediction in forecasting floods and its components over the Yarlung Zangbo River basin, China","In recent year, floods becomes a serious issue in the Tibetan Plateau (TP) due to climate change. Many studies have shown that ensemble flood forecasting based on numerical weather predictions can provide an early warning with extended lead time. However, the role of hydrological ensemble prediction in forecasting flood volume and its components over the Yarlung Zangbo River (YZR) basin, China, has not been investigated. This study adopts the variable infiltration capacity (VIC) model to forecast the annual maximum floods and annual first floods in the YZR based on precipitation and the maximum and minimum temperature from the European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts (ECMWF). N simulations are proposed to account for parameter uncertainty in VIC. Results show that when trade-offs between multiple objectives are significant, N simulations are recommended for better simulation and forecasting. This is why better results are obtained for the Nugesha and Yangcun stations. Our ensemble flood forecasting system can skillfully predict the maximum floods with a lead time of more than 10 d and can predict about 7 d ahead for meltwater-related components. The accuracy of forecasts for the first floods is inferior, with a lead time of only 5 d. The base-flow components for the first floods are insensitive to lead time, except at the Nuxia station, whilst for the maximum floods an obvious deterioration in performance with lead time can be recognized. The meltwater-induced surface runoff is the most poorly captured component by the forecast system, and the well-predicted rainfall-related components are the major contributor to good performance. The performance in 7 d accumulated flood volumes is better than the peak flows.",https://doi.org/10.5194/hess-23-3335-2019,10.5194/hess-23-3335-2019,"Liu, Li; Xu, Yue Ping; Pan, Su Li; Bai, Zhi Xu",HYDROLOGY AND EARTH SYSTEM SCIENCES,NA,RAINFALL-RUNOFF MODEL; GLOBAL CLIMATE MODELS; TIBETAN PLATEAU; MULTIOBJECTIVE CALIBRATION; STREAMFLOW PREDICTION; SPATIAL VARIABILITY; GLACIER MELT; LAND-COVER; SNOW; PRECIPITATION,NA,COPERNICUS GESELLSCHAFT MBH,GOTTINGEN,"BAHNHOFSALLEE 1E, GOTTINGEN, 37081, GERMANY",1027-5606,1607-7938,NA,HYDROL EARTH SYST SC,Hydrol.

FALSE,267,Improving the Reliability of Sub-Seasonal Forecasts of High and Low Flows by Using a Flow-Dependent Nonparametric Model,"Sub-seasonal streamflow forecasts are important for a range of water resource management applications, with a distinct practical interest in forecasts of high flows (e.g., for managing flood events) and low flows (e.g., for managing environmental flows). Despite this interest, differences in forecast performance for high and low flow events are not routinely investigated. Our study reveals that while forecasts evaluated over the full flow range can appear reliable, stratification into high/low flow ranges highlights significant under/over-estimation of forecast uncertainty, respectively. We overcome this challenge by introducing a flow-dependent (FD) nonparametric component into a post-processing model of hydrological forecasting errors, the Multi-Temporal Hydrological Residual Error (MuTHRE) model, yielding the MuTHRE-FD model. The MuTHRE and MuTHRE-FD models are compared in a case study with 11 Australian catchments, the GR4J rainfall-runoff model and post-processed rainfall forecasts from ACCESS-S. Through its improved treatment of flow-dependence, the MuTHRE-FD model achieves practically significant improvements over the original MuTHRE model in the reliability of forecasted cumulative volumes for: (a) high flows out to 7 days; (b) low flows out to 2 days; and (c) mid flows for majority of lead times. The new MuTHRE-FD model provides seamless sub-seasonal forecasts with high quality performance for both high and low flows over a range of lead times. This improvement provides forecast users with increased confidence in using sub-seasonal forecasts across a wide range of applications.",https://doi.org/10.1029/2020WR029317,10.1029/2020WR029317,"McInerney, David; Thyer, Mark; Kavetski, Dmitri; Laugesen, Richard; Woldemeskel, Fitsum; Tuteja, Narendra; Kuczera, George",WATER RESOURCES RESEARCH,Sub-seasonal streamflow forecasts; residual error model; innovations; flow dependence; streamflow post-processing,STREAMFLOW; PREDICTION; AUTOCORRELATION; INFERENCE; JOINT,NA,AMER GEOPHYSICAL UNION,WASHINGTON,"2000 FLORIDA AVE NW, WASHINGTON, DC 20009 USA",0043-1397,1944-7973,NA,WATER RESOUR RES,Water Resour.

FALSE,277,Analysis of the effects of biases in ensemble streamflow prediction (ESP) forecasts on electricity production in hydropower reservoir management,"This paper presents an analysis of the effects of biased extended streamflow prediction (ESP) forecasts on three deterministic optimization techniques implemented in a simulated operational context with a rolling horizon test bed for managing a cascade of hydroelectric reservoirs and generating stations in Quebec, Canada. The observed weather data were fed to the hydrological model, and the synthetic streamflow subsequently generated was considered to be a proxy for the observed inflow. A traditional, climatology-based ESP forecast approach was used to generate ensemble streamflow scenarios, which were used by three reservoir management optimization approaches. Both positive and negative biases were then forced into the ensembles by multiplying the streamflow values by constant factors. The optimization method's response to those biases was measured through the evaluation of the average annual energy generation in a forward-rolling simulation test bed in which the entire system is precisely and accurately modelled. The ensemble climate data forecasts, the hydrological modelling and ESP forecast generation, optimization model, and decision-making process are all integrated, as is the simulation model that updates reservoir levels and computes generation at each time step. The study focussed on one hydropower system both with and without minimum baseload constraints. This study finds that the tested deterministic optimization algorithms lack the capacity to compensate for uncertainty in future inflows and therefore place the reservoir levels at greater risk to maximize short-term profit. It is shown that for this particular system, an increase in ESP forecast inflows of approximately 5% allows managing the reservoirs at optimal levels and producing the most energy on average, effectively negating the deterministic model's tendency to underestimate the risk of spilling. Finally, it is shown that implementing minimum load constraints serves as a de facto control on deterministic bias by forcing the system to draw more water from the reservoirs than what the models consider to be optimal trajectories.",https://doi.org/10.5194/hess-23-2735-2019,10.5194/hess-23-2735-2019,"Arsenault, Richard; Cote, Pascal",HYDROLOGY AND EARTH SYSTEM SCIENCES,NA,STOCHASTIC OPTIMIZATION; SKILL; SDP,NA,COPERNICUS GESELLSCHAFT MBH,GOTTINGEN,"BAHNHOFSALLEE 1E, GOTTINGEN, 37081, GERMANY",1027-5606,1607-7938,NA,HYDROL EARTH SYST SC,Hydrol.

FALSE,279,Benchmarking ensemble streamflow prediction skill in the UK,"Skilful hydrological forecasts at sub-seasonal to seasonal lead times would be extremely beneficial for decision-making in water resources management, hydropower operations, and agriculture, especially during drought conditions. Ensemble streamflow prediction (ESP) is a well-established method for generating an ensemble of streamflow forecasts in the absence of skilful future meteorological predictions, instead using initial hydrologic conditions (IHCs), such as soil moisture, groundwater, and snow, as the source of skill. We benchmark when and where the ESP method is skilful across a diverse sample of 314 catchments in the UK and explore the relationship between catchment storage and ESP skill. The GR4J hydrological model was forced with historic climate sequences to produce a 51-member ensemble of streamflow hindcasts. We evaluated forecast skill seamlessly from lead times of 1 day to 12 months initialized at the first of each month over a 50-year hindcast period from 1965 to 2015. Results showed ESP was skilful against a climatology benchmark forecast in the majority of catchments across all lead times up to a year ahead, but the degree of skill was strongly conditional on lead time, forecast initialization month, and individual catchment location and storage properties. UK- wide mean ESP skill decayed exponentially as a function of lead time with continuous ranked probability skill scores across the year of 0.75, 0.20, and 0.11 for 1-day, 1-month, and 3-month lead times, respectively. However, skill was not uniform across all initialization months. For lead times up to 1 month, ESP skill was higher than average when initialized in summer and lower in winter months, whereas for longer seasonal and annual lead times skill was higher when initialized in autumn and winter months and lowest in spring. ESP was most skilful in the south and east of the UK, where slower responding catchments with higher soil moisture and groundwater storage are mainly located; correlation between catchment base flow index (BFI) and ESP skill was very strong (Spearman's rank correlation coefficient = 0.90 at 1-month lead time). This was in contrast to the more highly responsive catchments in the north and west which were generally not skilful at seasonal lead times. Overall, this work provides scientific justification for when and where use of such a relatively simple forecasting approach is appropriate in the UK. This study, furthermore, creates a low cost benchmark against which potential skill improvements from more sophisticated hydro-meteorological ensemble prediction systems can be judged.",https://doi.org/10.5194/hess-22-2023-2018,10.5194/hess-22-2023-2018,"Harrigan, Shaun; Prudhomme, Christel; Parry, Simon; Smith, Katie; Tanguy, Maliko",HYDROLOGY AND EARTH SYSTEM SCIENCES,NA,HYDROLOGICAL MODELS; UNITED-KINGDOM; FORECAST SKILL; SIMULATION; RAINFALL; SYSTEM; BASIN; DECOMPOSITION; BRITAIN; EUROPE,NA,COPERNICUS GESELLSCHAFT MBH,GOTTINGEN,"BAHNHOFSALLEE 1E, GOTTINGEN, 37081, GERMANY",1027-5606,1607-7938,NA,HYDROL EARTH SYST SC,Hydrol.

FALSE,283,Hydrological Model Diversity Enhances Streamflow Forecast Skill at Short- to Medium-Range Timescales,"We investigate the ability of hydrological multimodel ensemble predictions to enhance the skill of streamflow forecasts at short- to medium-range timescales. To generate the multimodel ensembles, we implement a new statistical postprocessor, namely, quantile regression-Bayesian model averaging (QR-BMA). Quantile regression-Bayesian model averaging uses quantile regression to bias correct the ensemble streamflow forecasts from the individual models and Bayesian model averaging to optimally combine their probability density functions. Additionally, we use an information-theoretic measure, namely, conditional mutual information, to quantify the skill enhancements from the multimodel forecasts. We generate ensemble streamflow forecasts at lead times from 1 to 7days using three hydrological models: (i) Antecedent Precipitation Index-Continuous, (ii) Hydrology Laboratory-Research Distributed Hydrologic Model, and (iii) Weather Research and Forecasting Hydrological modeling system. As forcing to the hydrological models, we use weather ensemble forecasts from the National Centers for Environmental Prediction 11-member Global Ensemble Forecast System Reforecast version 2. The forecasting experiments are performed for four nested basins of the North Branch Susquehanna River, USA. We find that after bias correcting the streamflow forecasts from each model, their skill performance becomes comparable. We find that the multimodel ensemble forecasts have higher skill than the best single-model forecasts. Furthermore, the skill enhancements obtained by the multimodel ensemble forecasts are found to be dominated by model diversity, rather than by increased ensemble size alone. This result, obtained using conditional mutual information, indicates that each hydrological model contributes additional information to enhance forecast skill. Overall, our results highlight benefits of hydrological multimodel forecasting for improving streamflow predictions.",https://doi.org/10.1029/2018WR023197,10.1029/2018WR023197,"Sharma, Sanjib; Siddique, Ridwan; Reed, Seann; Ahnert, Peter; Mejia, Alfonso",WATER RESOURCES RESEARCH,NA,COMBINING PREDICTIVE SCHEMES; TO-INTERANNUAL PREDICTION; ENSEMBLE FORECASTS; INTERCOMPARISON PROJECT; DATA ASSIMILATION; DAILY TEMPERATURE; ATLANTIC REGION; NEW-YORK; PRECIPITATION; SYSTEM,NA,AMER GEOPHYSICAL UNION,WASHINGTON,"2000 FLORIDA AVE NW, WASHINGTON, DC 20009 USA",0043-1397,1944-7973,NA,WATER RESOUR RES,Water Resour.

Skillful seasonal forecasts can drastically aid practical applications and productive sectors by reducing weather-related risks such as water availability. In this study two operational seasonal forecasting systems are tested in a water resource important watershed on the island of Crete. Hindcast precipitation and temperature data from the European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts (ECMWF) System 4 and Met Office GloSea5 systems are tested for their forecast skill up to seven months ahead. Data of both systems are downscaled and corrected for biases towards the observations. Different correction methods are applied and evaluated. Post-processed data from these methods are used as an input to the hydrological model HYPE, to provide streamflow forecasts. Results show that a prior adjustment of the two systems' precipitation and temperature may improve their forecast skill. Adjusted GloSea5 forecasts are slightly better estimates than the corresponding forecasts based on System 4. The results show that both systems provide a skillful ensemble streamflow prediction for one month ahead, with the skill decreasing rapidly beyond that. Update of the initial state of HYPE results in the reduction of the variability of the ensemble flow predictions and improves the skill but only as far as two months of forecast. Finally, the two systems were tested for their ability to capture a limited number of historical streamflow drought events, with indications that GloSea5 has a slightly better skill.",https://doi.org/10.3390/w10111593,10.3390/w10111593,"Grillakis, Manolis; Koutroulis, Aristeidis; Tsanis, Ioannis",WATER,seasonal ensemble streamflow prediction; Met Office GloSea5; ECMWF System 4; bias correction; initial conditions effect; basin scale,BIAS CORRECTION; SOIL-MOISTURE; STREAMFLOW FORECASTS; RAINFALL FORECASTS; CLIMATE; PRECIPITATION; MODEL; SKILL; TEMPERATURE; PREDICTIONS,NA,MDPI,BASEL,"ST ALBAN-ANLAGE 66, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND",2073-4441,NA,NA,WATER-SUI,Water,NOV,2018,10,11,NA,NA,1593,NA
FALSE,287,Long-Lead Seasonal Prediction of Streamflow over the Upper Colorado River Basin: The Role of the Pacific Sea Surface Temperature and Beyond,"We have developed two statistical models for extended seasonal predictions of the upper Colorado River basin (UCRB) natural streamflow during April-July: a stepwise linear regression (reduced to a simple regression with one predictor) and a neural network model. Monthly, basin-averaged soil moisture, snow water equivalent (SWE), precipitation, and the Pacific sea surface temperature (SST) are selected as potential predictors. Pacific SST predictors (PSPs) are derived from a dipole pattern over the Pacific (30 degrees S-65 degrees N) that is correlated with the lagging streamflow. For both models, the correlation between the hindcasted and observed streamflow exceeds 0.60 for lead times less than 4 months using soil moisture, SWE, and precipitation as predictors. This correlation is higher than that of an autoregression model (correlation similar to 0.50). Since these land surface and atmospheric variables have no statistically significant correlations with the streamflow, PSPs are then incorporated into the models. The two models have a correlation of similar to 0.50 using PSPs alone for lead times from 6 to 9 months, and such skills are probably associated with stronger correlation between SST and streamflow in recent decades. The similar prediction skills between the two models suggest a largely linear system between SST and streamflow. Four predictors together can further improve short-lead prediction skills (correlation similar to 0.80). Therefore, our results confirm the advantage of the Pacific SST information in predicting the UCRB streamflow with a long lead time and can provide useful climate information for water supply planning and decisions.",https://doi.org/10.1175/JCLI-D-20-0824.1,10.1175/JCLI-D-20-0824.1,"Zhao, Siyu; Fu, Rong; Zhuang, Yizhou; Wang, Gaoyun",JOURNAL OF CLIMATE,North America; Pacific Ocean; Streamflow; Sea surface temperature; Seasonal forecasting; Statistical forecasting; Neural networks,CANONICAL CORRELATION-ANALYSIS; GENESIS POTENTIAL INDEX; CLIMATE VARIABILITY; MONSOON RAINFALL; DROUGHT; SKILL; PRECIPITATION; OSCILLATION; METEOROLOGY; CHALLENGES,NA,AMER METEOROLOGICAL SOC,BOSTON,"45 BEACON ST, BOSTON, MA 02108-3693 USA",0894-8755,1520-0442,NA,J CLIMATE,J.

These methods applied as a pre-processor suitable for integration into the conceptual rainfall-runoff HBV (Hydrologiska Byrans Vattenbalansavdelning) model were assessed for hydrological modelling based on seasonal hydrographs. The enhanced HBV model was able to generate an ensemble (interval) hydrographs and averaged streamflow simulation. The proposed system, which was constructed to examine the possibility of employing EUMETSAT Satellite Application Facility on Support to Operational Hydrology and Water Management (H-SAF) data (e.g., precipitation and soil moisture), was shown to be useful in improving model updating and forecasting. Data from the Sola River mountain part of southern Poland, was used. A bias correction algorithm for a distribution derived transformation method was also developed by exploring Generalized Exponential (GE) theoretical distributions, along with Gamma (GA) and Weibull (WE) distributions on the different data used in this study. In order to remove biases in the ensemble of soil moisture the bias correction within the ensemble Kalman filter (EnKF-BC) was used as a post-processing technique. In terms of the precipitation and soil moisture satellite outputs, the EnKF-BC pre-processed HBV models significantly improved the accuracy of the simulated hydrographs in the summer season, while the positive effect of the corrected satellite precipitation was seen in the winter.",https://doi.org/,NA,"Ciupak, Maurycy; Ozga-Zielinski, Bogdan; Adamowski, Jan",III KRAJOWY KONGRES HYDROLOGICZNY: HYDROLOGIA W INZYNIERII I OCHRONIE SRODOWISKA,bias correction; distribution derived transformation; ensemble Kalman filter; precipitation and root zone soil moisture index; H-SAF products,SOIL-MOISTURE; MODEL,NA,WYDAWNICTWA KGW PAN,WARSZAWA,"UL PODLESNA 61, WARSZAWA, 01-673, POLAND",0867-7816,NA,NA,MONOGR KOM GOSPOD WE,NA,NA,2018,41,NA,5,19,NA,NA
FALSE,290,Improving probabilistic hydroclimatic projections through high-resolution convection-permitting climate modeling and Markov chain Monte Carlo simulations,"Understanding future changes in hydroclimatic variables plays a crucial role in improving resilience and adaptation to extreme weather events such as floods and droughts. In this study, we develop high-resolution climate projections over Texas by using the convection-permitting Weather Research and Forecasting (WRF) model with 4km horizontal grid spacing, and then produce the Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC)-based hydrologic forecasts in the Guadalupe River basin which is the primary concern of the Texas Water Development Board and the Guadalupe-Blanco River Authority. The Parameter-elevation Regressions on Independent Slopes Model (PRISM) dataset is used to verify the WRF climate simulations. The Model Parameter Estimation Experiment (MOPEX) dataset is used to validate probabilistic hydrologic predictions. Projected changes in precipitation, potential evapotranspiration (PET) and streamflow at different temporal scales are examined by dynamically downscaling climate projections derived from 15 Coupled Model Intercomparison Project Phase 5 (CMIP5) general circulation models (GCMs). Our findings reveal that the Upper Coast Climate Division of Texas is projected to experience the most remarkable wetting caused by precipitation and PET changes, whereas the most significant drying is expected to occur for the North Central Texas Climate Division. The dry Guadalupe River basin is projected to become drier with a substantial increase in future drought risks, especially for the summer season. And the extreme precipitation events are projected to increase in frequency and intensity with a reduction in overall precipitation frequency, which may result in more frequent occurrences of flash floods and drought episodes in the Guadalupe River basin.",https://doi.org/10.1007/s00382-019-04702-7,10.1007/s00382-019-04702-7,"Wang, S.; Wang, Y.",CLIMATE DYNAMICS,Convection permitting; High-resolution climate projection; Hydroclimatic changes; Markov chain Monte Carlo; Pseudo global warming,REGIONAL CLIMATE; WINTER PRECIPITATION; CHANGE IMPACTS; FUTURE CHANGES; WATER-BALANCE; FORECASTS; SENSITIVITY; ROBUST; MULTIMODEL; INFERENCE,NA,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"ONE NEW YORK PLAZA, SUITE 4600, NEW YORK, NY, UNITED STATES",0930-7575,1432-0894,NA,CLIM DYNAM,Clim.

FALSE,291,Long-term Reservoir Inflow Forecasts: Enhanced Water Supply and Inflow Volume Accuracy Using Deep Learning,"Machine-learning algorithms have shown promise for streamflow forecasts, reservoir operations, and scheduling, but have exhibited lower accuracy in predicting extended time horizons for reservoir inflows. Newer deep learning algorithms exhibited improved inflow forecasting accuracy, but existing research has been mostly limited to real-time operation and short-term planning. We propose a new multi-step forecasting approach to improve long-term forecasting accuracy for both water supply and inflow volumes. This approach uses historical snow water equivalent (SWE) and reservoir inflow time-series data to train an Encoder-Decoder algorithm to predict the reservoir inflow of future time-steps during the April-July runoff period. The optimal model and hyperparameters are selected through five-fold time-series cross validation for variations between long shortterm memory (LSTM) and convolutional neural network (CNN) Encoder-Decoder algorithms. We evaluated each algorithm using 30 years of reservoir inflow and SWE data at the Upper Stillwater Reservoir located in Utah. The optimal model was an LSTM Encoder-Decoder algorithm with 16 nodes per layer. Using this algorithm, we investigate the trade-off between model complexity and accuracy for long-term water supply, relative to a process-based Ensemble Streamflow Prediction (ESP) model as a baseline and simpler statistical methods traditionally used in forecasting (SARIMA, VAR, TBATS). Long-term water supply forecasts of the optimal deep learning algorithm proved superior to statistical methods and rivaled those of the ESP 50% exceedance probability forecast (i.e. the most probable forecast) evaluated over five consecutive hold-out periods.",https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jhydrol.2021.126676,10.1016/j.jhydrol.2021.126676,"Herbert, Zachary C.; Asghar, Zeeshan; Oroza, Carlos A.",JOURNAL OF HYDROLOGY,Reservoir; Forecastin; Deep learning; Snow; Inflow,ARTIFICIAL NEURAL-NETWORKS; PROBABILISTIC FORECASTS; STOCHASTIC SIMULATION; BLOCK BOOTSTRAP; TIME-SERIES; MODEL; VERIFICATION; RAINFALL; SERVICE; SYSTEM,NA,ELSEVIER,AMSTERDAM,"RADARWEG 29, 1043 NX AMSTERDAM, NETHERLANDS",0022-1694,1879-2707,NA,J HYDROL,J.

FALSE,295,Forecast of AMD Quantity by a Series Tank Model in Three Stages: Case Studies in Two Closed Japanese Mines,"There are about 100 sites of acid mine drainage (AMD) from abandoned/closed mines in Japan. For their sustainable treatment, future prediction of AMD quantity is crucial. In this study, AMD quantity was predicted for two closed mines in Japan based on a series tank model in three stages. The tank model parameters were determined from the relationship between the observed AMD quantity and the inflow of rainfall and snowmelt by using the Kalman filter and particle swarm optimization methods. The Automated Meteorological Data Acquisition System (AMeDAS) data of rainfall were corrected for elevation and by the statistical daily fluctuation model. The snowmelt was estimated from the AMeDAS data of rainfall, temperature, and sunshine duration by using mass and heat balance of snow. Fitting with one year of daily data was sufficient to obtain the AMD quantity model. Future AMD quantity was predicted by the constructed model using the forecast data of rainfall and temperature proposed by the Max Planck Institute-Earth System Model (MPI-ESM), based on the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) representative concentration pathway (RCP) 2.6 and RCP8.5 scenarios. The results showed that global warming causes an increase in the quantity and fluctuation of AMD, especially for large reservoirs and residence time of AMD.

FALSE,300,The benefit of using an ensemble of seasonal streamflow forecasts in water allocation decisions,"The area to be cropped in irrigation districts needs to be planned according to the allocated water, which in turn is a function of the available water resource. Initially conservative estimates of future (in)flows in rivers and reservoirs may lead to unnecessary reduction of the water allocated. Though water allocations may be revised as the season progresses, inconsistency in allocation is undesirable to farmers as they may then not be able to use that water, leading to an opportunity cost in agricultural production. We assess the benefit of using reservoir inflow estimates derived from seasonal forecast datasets to improve water allocation decisions. A decision model is developed to emulate the feedback loop between simulated reservoir storage and water allocations to irrigated crops and is evaluated using inflow forecasts generated with the Forecast Guided Stochastic Scenarios (FoGSS) model, a 12-month ensemble streamflow forecasting system. Two forcings are used to generate the forecasts: ensemble streamflow prediction - ESP (historical rainfall) - and POAMA (calibrated rainfall forecasts from the POAMA climate prediction system). We evaluate the approach in the Murrumbidgee basin in Australia, comparing water allocations obtained with an expected reservoir inflow from FoGSS against the allocations obtained with the currently used conservative estimate based on climatology as well as against allocations obtained using observed inflows (perfect information). The inconsistency in allocated water is evaluated by determining the total changes in allocated water made every 15 d from the initial allocation at the start of the water year to the end of the irrigation season, including both downward and upward revisions of allocations. Results show that the inconsistency due to upward revisions in allocated water is lower when using the forecast datasets (POAMA and ESP) compared to the conservative inflow estimates (reference), which is beneficial to the planning of cropping areas by farmers. Overconfidence can, however, lead to an increase in undesirable downward revisions. This is more evident for dry years than for wet years. Over the 28 years for which allocation decisions are evaluated, we find that the accuracy of the available water estimates using the forecast ensemble improves progressively during the water year, especially 1.5 months before the start of the cropping season in November. This is significant as it provides farmers with additional time to make key decisions on planting. Our results show that seasonal streamflow forecasts can provide benefit in informing water allocation policies, particularly by earlier establishing final water allocations to farmers in the irrigation season. This allows them to plan better and use water allocated more efficiently.",https://doi.org/10.5194/hess-24-3851-2020,10.5194/hess-24-3851-2020,"Kaune, Alexander; Chowdhury, Faysal; Werner, Micha; Bennett, James",HYDROLOGY AND EARTH SYSTEM SCIENCES,NA,MURRAY-DARLING BASIN; IRRIGATION; DROUGHT; MODEL; CLIMATE; AGRICULTURE; PREDICTION; RAINFALL; SYSTEM; REFORM,NA,COPERNICUS GESELLSCHAFT MBH,GOTTINGEN,"BAHNHOFSALLEE 1E, GOTTINGEN, 37081, GERMANY",1027-5606,1607-7938,NA,HYDROL EARTH SYST SC,Hydrol.

FALSE,302,"Statistical and dynamical downscaling impact on projected hydrologic assessment in arid environment: A case study from Bill Williams River basin and Alamo Lake, Arizona","A study was conducted to assess the projected impact of future climate on Alamo Lake and the Bill Williams River basin. We analyzed simulations of three-selected Representative Concentration Pathways 8.5 Global Climate Models (GCM) (i.e. HadGEM2-ES, MPI-ESM-LR and GFDL-ESM2M). These GCMs which, were part of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) Fifth Assessment Report, were selected as well performing GCMs that represent the historic climatology and prevailing precipitation bearing synoptic conditions in the southwest US. An analysis of both statistically and dynamically downscaled simulations projected increase in the frequency of dry winters during the mid-21st century (2020-2059) in two out of the three selected GCMs. For summer precipitation, the statistically downscaled simulations are inconclusive whereas, the dynamically downscaled simulations showed significant but contradicting future projections. In order to assess the impact of the projected climate on the hydrologic cycle at the Bill Williams River basins, we developed a modeling framework that includes the following components: 1) a weather generator that produces realizations of likely hourly precipitation events over the basin; 2) a hydrologic model that is based on the Colorado Basin River Forecast Center (CBRFC), National Weather Service modeling configuration that predicts flow at ten internal points and inflow into Alamo Lake; and 3) a lake model with the existing operation rules to simulates the lake outflow and levels. Using the above-described modeling framework, the impact of the projected mid 21-century climate on Alamo Lake was examined with respect to the total outflow from the dam, the frequency of large outflow events, and the frequency of high and low lake levels. The results show that dynamic downscaling provides a larger range of impacts than those provided by statistical downscaling. The results also indicate a wide range of impact scenarios with contradicting trends among the selected climate projections for mid-21st Century. These results imply increasing challenges in operating the Lake at its target level. This modeling framework can potentially be used to examine various future scenarios and to develop recommendations for a sustainable management scheme for the Alamo Lake. (C) 2019 The Author(s).

FALSE,306,Seasonal Climate Forecast Skill Assessment for the Management of Water Resources in a Run of River Hydropower System in the Poqueira River (Southern Spain),"Run of river (RoR) hydropower systems, despite being one of the most cost-effective and environmentally benign energy technologies, have the disadvantage that production is not constant because it is subject to a high variability in precipitation and snow cover. In addition, the management of RoR plants has to comply with some particular operating conditions, but also with some environmental flow requirements. This work presents the assessment of the main inputs included in a climate service, historical local data and the seasonal forecast of water inflow to RoR plants, which are used to predict the operability and the expected energy production. The analysis is presented through the application in a pilot RoR system located in the south of Spain, in a semi-arid Mediterranean area impacted by snow, where seasonal forecasting is especially challenging. The results show the high interannual variability of the operation in this kind of facilities. The outcomes indicate that seasonal climate forecast information would improve the prediction of observed river streamflow by 7.4% in reliability and 3.2% in sharpness compared to the current operational forecast based on historical data. The climate forecasts thus provide valuable information for the exploitation of available water resources, which generates a significant value for the operation of the plant and the energy production market.",https://doi.org/10.3390/w12082119,10.3390/w12082119,"Contreras, Eva; Herrero, Javier; Crochemore, Louise; Aguilar, Cristina; Jose Polo, Maria",WATER,climate service; seasonal forecast; energy production; Mediterranean high-mountain climate; reliability; sharpness,PRECIPITATION FORECASTS; STREAMFLOW; MODEL; BASIN,NA,MDPI,BASEL,"ST ALBAN-ANLAGE 66, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND",NA,2073-4441,NA,WATER-SUI,Water,AUG,2020,12,8,NA,NA,2119,NA
FALSE,307,"A Multivariate Approach to Generate Synthetic Short-To-Medium Range Hydro-Meteorological Forecasts Across Locations, Variables, and Lead Times","The use of hydro-meteorological forecasts in water resources management holds great promise as a soft pathway to improve system performance. Methods for generating synthetic forecasts of hydro-meteorological variables are crucial for robust validation of forecast use, as numerical weather prediction hindcasts are only available for a relatively short period (10-40 years) that is insufficient for assessing risk related to forecast-informed decision-making during extreme events. We develop a generalized error model for synthetic forecast generation that is applicable to a range of forecasted variables used in water resources management. The approach samples from the distribution of forecast errors over the available hindcast period and adds them to long records of observed data to generate synthetic forecasts. The approach utilizes the Skew Generalized Error Distribution (SGED) to model marginal distributions of forecast errors that can exhibit heteroskedastic, auto-correlated, and non-Gaussian behavior. An empirical copula is used to capture covariance between variables, forecast lead times, and across space. We demonstrate the method for medium-range forecasts across Northern California in two case studies for (1) streamflow and (2) temperature and precipitation, which are based on hindcasts from the NOAA/NWS Hydrologic Ensemble Forecast System (HEFS) and the NCEP GEFS/R V2 climate model, respectively. The case studies highlight the flexibility of the model and its ability to emulate space-time structures in forecasts at scales critical for water resources management.

To generate the flood inundation forecasts, a one-dimensional hydraulic model, namely the Hydrologic Engineering Center's River Analysis System (HEC-RAS), is coupled to a regional hydrological ensemble prediction system (RHEPS). The RHEPS is comprised of: i) hydrometeorological observations; ii) weather ensembles from the National Centers for Environmental Prediction Global Ensemble Forecast System Reforecast version 2 (GEFSRv2); and iii) Hydrology Laboratory Research Distributed Hydrologic Model (HL-RDHM) as the hydrological model. The coupled RHEPS-hydraulic system is evaluated along the tidal Delaware River near the City of Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, U.S. For the evaluation, emphasis is placed on the tidal-riverine transitional zone of the Delaware River and the downstream propagation of hydrometeorological uncertainty through the flood inundation forecasts. The coupled system is used to generate hourly flood inundation forecasts at lead times from 1 to 7 days, over the period 2008-2013. Additionally, WSEs from the coupled system are statistically postprocessed using quantile regression (QR). Results show that the raw flood inundation ensemble forecasts exhibit higher skill than the deterministic ones. We also find that statistical postprocessing improves the skill of the raw flood inundation ensemble forecasts, with greater improvements at the longer lead times (> 3 days). Overall, we find that both weather ensembles and statistical WSE postprocessing can be used to enhance the skill of flood inundation forecasts at short- to medium-range timescales. In turn, this may serve to enhance the spatial representation of flood forecasts several days in advance, which could contribute in the future to making flood forecast communication and warnings more effective.",https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jhydrol.2018.10.063,10.1016/j.jhydrol.2018.10.063,"Gomez, Michael; Sharma, Sanjib; Reed, Seann; Mejia, Alfonso",JOURNAL OF HYDROLOGY,Hydrologic-hydraulic modeling; Flood mapping; Statistical postprocessing; Numerical weather prediction; Weather ensembles,QUANTILE REGRESSION; ATLANTIC REGION; GIS TECHNIQUES; UNCERTAINTY; SYSTEM; RIVER; PREDICTION; MODEL; SCALE; CALIBRATION,NA,ELSEVIER,AMSTERDAM,"RADARWEG 29, 1043 NX AMSTERDAM, NETHERLANDS",0022-1694,1879-2707,NA,J HYDROL,J.

FALSE,313,Predicting adverse scenarios for a transboundary coastal aquifer system in the Atacama Desert (Peru/Chile),"The Caplina/Concordia transboundary coastal aquifer system, located in the Atacama Desert, is the primary source of water supply for domestic use and irrigation for La Yarada-Los Palos (Peru) and Concordia (Chile) agriculture districts, and to a lesser extent, for Tacna province public supply use (Peru). Despite the scarce amount of rainfall (<20 mm/year) in the area and the limited recharge coming from the Andean highlands, this transboundary aquifer system has been overexploited mainly for agriculture since before the 2000s on the Peruvian side. Consequently, this has caused groundwater depletion and seawater intrusion. In this study, comprehensive hydrogeological information was integrated to understand the aquifer system's behavior and the effects to which it has been subjected to groundwater overexploitation. To that end, a 3D hydrogeological framework was developed using the LEAPFROG software and a constant-density groundwater flow model with equivalent heads was generated in FEFLOW software, which was adjusted with Monte Carlo analysis and conventional automated calibration. Finally, eight scenarios, considering various water resource management options proposed by the authority and potential climatic trends (CMIP6), were simulated from 2020 to 2040. The results showed that between 2002 and 2020, the increase in the seawater wedge and the average groundwater level decline were 216 hm3/year and 7 m, respectively. It is expected that the depletion will continue with a groundwater level decline between 5 and 8 m and an increase in the seawater wedge between 1120 hm3/year and 1175 hm(3)/year for the forecast period. The study concludes that the aquifer system will remain unsustainable for the next 20 years, regardless of the selected scenarios, and suggests that any mitigation measure requires the participation of stakeholders from Peru, Chile, and Bolivia.

FALSE,316,The role of probabilistic precipitation forecasts in hydrologic predictability,"Accurate streamflow forecasts enable the appropriate management of water resources. Although there is a general consensus that climate information can enhance hydrological predictability, this might not be the case if the accuracy of the given climate information is unreliable. Hence, this study has developed a modeling framework to estimate the role of climate information in forecasting accurate streamflow. Ensemble streamflow prediction (ESP) technology was adopted as a dynamic hydrologic forecast method to 35 watersheds in South Korea. The probabilistic precipitation forecast (PPF), issued by the Korea Meteorological Administration, was used as climate information for updating the probabilities of climate scenarios. First, we found that the current PPF is not accurate enough for significantly enhancing the streamflow forecasting accuracy. Subsequently, multiple sets of PPF were synthetically generated to evaluate the role of climate information. Given the perfect categorical climate forecasts, we found that there is much potential for the enhancement of streamflow forecast skill especially in the seasons that exhibit greater streamflow variability. However, there is less potential for increasing the streamflow forecasting skill under below-normal conditions. The proposed modeling framework is capable of quantifying the magnitude of potential improvement in hydrological predictability under the assumption that better climate information will be available in the future. We expect that this modeling framework can be effectively applied to other regions across a wide range of climate regimes.",https://doi.org/10.1007/s00704-020-03273-6,10.1007/s00704-020-03273-6,"Seo, Seung Beom; Sung, Jang Hyun",THEORETICAL AND APPLIED CLIMATOLOGY,Streamflow forecast; Probabilistic precipitation forecast; ESP; Climate information; Hydrological predictability,ENSEMBLE STREAMFLOW FORECASTS; RUNOFF MODEL; CLIMATE; PREDICTION; RAINFALL; WEATHER; ENSO; OPTIMIZATION; OPERATION; TIME,NA,SPRINGER WIEN,WIEN,"SACHSENPLATZ 4-6, PO BOX 89, A-1201 WIEN, AUSTRIA",0177-798X,1434-4483,NA,THEOR APPL CLIMATOL,Theor.

FALSE,319,Land use change uncertainty impacts on streamflow and sediment projections in areas undergoing rapid development: A case study in the Mekong Basin,"Quantitative understanding of potential changes in streamflow and sediment load is complicated by uncertainty related to land use change projections, which is characterized by a high uncertainty in terms of demand (quantity) and location of changes (spatial distribution). We simulate the Sesan, Srepok, and Sekong Rivers (3S), the most important tributaries of the lower Mekong River, with the Soil and Water Assessment Tool (SWAT) to investigate the implications of conversion of forest to agricultural lands. Multiple land use transitions in the 3S basin are projected using the Land Change Modeler. The uncertainty in land use projection was addressed using an ensemble forecasting approach for 2060, combining (a) three land demand scenarios, (b) two transition potential modeling approaches (i.e., approach to create maps of the likelihood for areas to transition from one land use type to another), and (c) retaining or not protected areas. Land demand leads to the greatest uncertainty in land use change projections. Transition potential modeling approaches do not make much difference in the total change, but can result in spatial variations of change. Retaining protected areas can contribute significantly to uncertainty in land use change projections. Decrease in annual streamflow of the 3S basin varied from 3% to 21%, and changes in annual sediment outflux from the basin ranged from -8% to 249% for simulated scenarios. Land use demand uncertainty results in the highest streamflow and sediment load changes and can thus have major consequences for water and sediment management strategies in areas undergoing rapid development.",https://doi.org/10.1002/ldr.2831,10.1002/ldr.2831,"Shrestha, Bikesh; Cochrane, Thomas A.; Caruso, Brian S.; Arias, Mauricio E.",LAND DEGRADATION & DEVELOPMENT,deforestation; land change modeler; sediment; South East Asia; SWAT; Mekong Basin,SWAT MODEL APPLICATION; LARGE RIVER-BASIN; SUSPENDED SEDIMENT; HYDROLOGICAL IMPACTS; USE/COVER CHANGE; WATER-RESOURCES; CLIMATE-CHANGE; ENSEMBLE; FOREST; SOIL,NA,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",1085-3278,1099-145X,NA,LAND DEGRAD DEV,Land Degrad.

FALSE,324,Varying-parameter modeling within ensemble architecture: Application to extended streamflow forecasting,"Extended streamflow forecasting is nowadays important for early flood warning and risk mitigation under a changing climate. However, the absence of reliable estimates of the usual streamflow descriptors, at the considered time horizons, renders common input-output modeling approaches inapt for extended forecasting. For such a problem, system recurrence information is vital to produce relatively improved forecasts. Like any time series generated by complex systems, river flow can be represented by a time-varying parameter (TVP) model. TVP modeling frameworks often assume that the system evolution exhibits superstatistical random walks, and a number of statistical assumptions is followed upon, to infer better forecasts from the system. Also, the TVPs should hone a model's ability to capture system recurrence, which in this case translates to a number of state-based model structures. In this work, we develop an ensemble-based computationally efficient method that extracts useful cyclic-type TVPs which are strongly coupled over extended, but more continuous and less aggregated, time horizons. A multi-level modeling framework is proposed to facilitate the creation and direct use of updated parameter states to produce more reliable forecasts on the considered temporal resolutions. A dummy-variable optimization technique is also proposed within the state-updating procedure to allow smooth state transition. We show that the modeling framework produces stable results of parameter variations at different time horizons when applied to estimate the streamflow of Clearwater River. The proposed framework can incorporate exogenous descriptors at different levels without loss of generality and can be used for various forecasting applications.",https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jhydrol.2019.124511,10.1016/j.jhydrol.2019.124511,"Alobaidi, Mohammad H.; Meguid, Mohamed A.; Chebana, Fateh",JOURNAL OF HYDROLOGY,System Identification; Time-varying paramter (TVP); Multi-level modeling; Dummy variable optimization; Ensemble Learning; Streamflow forecasting,SUBSPACE IDENTIFICATION; KALMAN FILTER; TIME,NA,ELSEVIER,AMSTERDAM,"RADARWEG 29, 1043 NX AMSTERDAM, NETHERLANDS",0022-1694,1879-2707,NA,J HYDROL,J.

However, there is a lack of research on the cause analysis and scenario prediction of water resources vulnerability (WRV) in the three basins, which is the very important foundation for the management of water resources. First of all, based on the analysis of the causes of water resources vulnerability, this article set up the evaluation index system of water resource vulnerability from three aspects: water quantity, water quality and disaster. Then, we use the Improved Blind Deletion Rough Set (IBDRS) method to reduce the dimension of the index system, and we reduce the original 24 indexes to 12 evaluation indexes. Third, by comparing the accuracy of random forest (RF) and artificial neural network (ANN) models, we use the RF model with high fitting accuracy as the evaluation and prediction model. Finally, we use 12 evaluation indexes and an RF model to analyze the trend and causes of water resources vulnerability in three basins during 2000-2015, and further predict the scenarios in 2020 and 2030. The results show that the vulnerability level of water resources in the three basins has been improved during 2000-2015, and the three river basins should follow the development of scenario 1 to ensure the safety of water resources. The research proved that the combination of IBDRS and an RF model is a very effective method to evaluate and forecast the vulnerability of water resources in the Huang-Huai-Hai River Basin.",https://doi.org/10.3390/e22030333,10.3390/e22030333,"Chen, Yan; Feng, Yazhong; Zhang, Fan; Yang, Fan; Wang, Lei",ENTROPY,Huang-Huai-Hai river basin; water resources vulnerability; assessment; scenario prediction; random forest model,ROUGH SET; REGION; AREAS; SCALE,NA,MDPI,BASEL,"ST ALBAN-ANLAGE 66, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND",NA,1099-4300,NA,ENTROPY-SWITZ,Entropy,MAR,2020,22,3,NA,NA,333,NA
FALSE,329,Multivariate remotely sensed and in-situ data assimilation for enhancing community WRF-Hydro model forecasting,"Flood is one of the most catastrophic natural disasters in the United States, particularly in the Southeast states where hurricanes and tropical storms are most prevalent, causing billions of dollars in damage annually and significant losses of life and property. The Weather Research and Forecasting Hydrological model (WRF-Hydro) is a community-based hydrologic model designed to improve the skill of hydrometeorological forecasts, such as river discharge, through simulating hydrologic prognostic (e.g., soil moisture) and diagnostic (e.g., energy fluxes) variables. These quantities are potentially biased or erroneous due to the uncertainties involved in all layers of hydrologic predictions. In this study, we use an ensemble based Data Assimilation (DA) approach to explore the benefit of independently and jointly assimilating remotely sensed SMAP (Soil Moisture Active Passive) soil moisture (at different spatial resolutions) and USGS streamflow observations to improve the accuracy and reliability of WRF-Hydro model predictions while accounting for uncertainties. This study is conducted over a large region near to Houston, Texas where heavy rainfall from hurricane Harvey caused flooding in 2017. Before implementing DA, we first calibrated the WRF-Hydro model parameters using four United States Geological Survey (USGS) stream gauges installed within the watershed. In this step, we identified the most dominant model parameters, which were used later in the development of joint state-parameter DA. The findings of this study showed that the multivariate assimilation of soil moisture and streamflow observations results in improved prediction of stream flow as compared to univariate assimilation configurations and regardless of the watershed's streamflow regime. The results also revealed that, during the normal streamflow condition, assimilation of downscaled SMAP soil moisture at 1 km spatial resolution, would improve the accuracy of streamflow simulation more than the assimilation of coarse resolution products (i.e., the native SMAP at 36 km spatial resolution and its interpolated version at 9 km spatial resolution). However, during the period of hurricane Harvey, the soil moisture observations at different resolutions showed a similar impact on improving the streamflow prediction.",https://doi.org/10.1016/j.advwatres.2020.103721,10.1016/j.advwatres.2020.103721,"Abbaszadeh, Peyman; Gavahi, Keyhan; Moradkhani, Hamid",ADVANCES IN WATER RESOURCES,Flood prediction; WRF-Hydro; Data assimilation; SMAP soil moisture,SOIL-MOISTURE PRODUCT; ENSEMBLE KALMAN FILTER; PARTICLE FILTER; CLIMATE-CHANGE; SEQUENTIAL ASSIMILATION; EXTREME RAINFALL; STREAMFLOW; CALIBRATION; EVAPOTRANSPIRATION; UNCERTAINTY,NA,ELSEVIER SCI LTD,OXFORD,"THE BOULEVARD, LANGFORD LANE, KIDLINGTON, OXFORD OX5 1GB, OXON, ENGLAND",0309-1708,1872-9657,NA,ADV WATER RESOUR,Adv.

FALSE,337,Variational assimilation of streamflow data in distributed flood forecasting,"Data assimilation has the potential to improve flood forecasting. However, research efforts are still needed for an effective development of assimilation schemes suitable for operational usage, especially in case of distributed hydrologic models. This work presents a new assimilation system of streamflow data from multiple locations in a distributed hydrologic model. The system adopts a mixed variational-Monte Carlo approach, and is here tested with the hydrologic model MOBIDIC, that is part of the operational flood forecasting chain for Arno river in central Italy. The main objective of the work is to evaluate the actual gain that the system can lead to flood predictions in a real-time operational usage. Accordingly, a specifically designed assessment strategy is employed. It is based on several hindcast experiments that include both high flow and false alarm events in the period 2009-2014 in Arno river basin. Results show that the assimilation system can significantly increase the accuracy of flow predictions in respect to open loop simulations in both cases. Specific performances depend on location and event, but in the majority of cases the error on predicted peak flow is reduced of more than 50% with a lead time of around 10 h. The analysis reveals also that the structure of the hydrologic model, the coherence between observations at various sites, and the initial watershed saturation level, considerably affect the obtainable performances.

Effectively predicting water temperature is a key issue related to environment management. This study develops a probabilistic model based on C-vine copulas for water temperature prediction. The proposed framework is applied to forecast daily water temperature in the Yangtze River, considering long-term effects of preceding air temperature and daily discharge. The prediction performance of this framework is compared with the logistic regression model (LogR) and generalized regression neural network (GRNN). The results of this study indicate that the proposed C-vine copula framework and GRNN model provide better forecasting of stream temperature with weak human-related disturbances than LogR model. The outperformance of C-vine framework is reflected by its ability to accurately capture variations in the water temperature greatly affected by the Three Gorges Reservoir (TGR). This steady and reliable framework is further applied for the conservation of Chinese Sturgeon to estimate the range of suggested discharge, given the daily air temperatures, to adjust the water temperature within 18-20 degrees C at Yichang station during the spawning season. This application is verified to be more effective, providing indications for reservoir management to lower water temperatures by regulating river flow to ensure the occurrence of spawning activities.

Here we demonstrate that the annual water supply of the Colorado River is predictable up to several years in advance by a drift-free decadal climate prediction system using a fully coupled climate model. Observational analyses and model experiments show that prolonged shortages of water supply in the Colorado River are significantly linked to sea surface temperature precursors including tropical Pacific cooling, North Pacific warming, and southern tropical Atlantic warming. In the Colorado River basin, the water deficits can reduce crop yield and increase wildfire potential. Thus, a multi-year prediction of severe water shortages in the Colorado River basin could be useful as an early indicator of subsequent agricultural loss and wildfire risk. Sea surface temperature anomalies in the Atlantic and Pacific Oceans can help predict water shortages in the Colorado River basin, according to analyses of decadal climate predictions and observations.",https://doi.org/10.1038/s43247-020-00027-0,10.1038/s43247-020-00027-0,"Chikamoto, Yoshimitsu; Wang, S-Y Simon; Yost, Matt; Yocom, Larissa; Gillies, Robert R.",COMMUNICATIONS EARTH & ENVIRONMENT,NA,UNITED-STATES; DROUGHT; FLOW; VARIABILITY; STREAMFLOW,NA,SPRINGERNATURE,LONDON,"CAMPUS, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON, N1 9XW, ENGLAND",NA,2662-4435,NA,COMMUN EARTH ENVIRON,Commun.

Risk analysis models that neglect such dependences potentially yield biased results regarding flood control operations. To enhance the accuracy of flood risk analysis and inform decision making regarding real-time flood control for a multireservoir system, this study proposed an integrated flood risk identification, analysis, and diagnosis model framework that incorporates the multidimensional dependences of forecast uncertainties. The framework includes an uncertainty identification model that uses the copula function to characterize the joint probability function of the mixed dependent uncertainties. It also incorporates a realtime flood risk analysis module that couples simulation and optimization to convert the complex multiobjective operation under uncertainty into a tractable model capable of flexibly evaluating individual and joint flood risks. The third component is a risk diagnosis module that calculates risk contributions using conditional probability, and identifies stable and vulnerable reservoirs within the system to alter operational decisions toward risk reduction. Methodologies were verified through application to a mixed four-reservoir system in the Pi River Basin, China. The principal findings were as follows. (1) Positive-dominated dependences of forecast uncertainties were identified because of error propagation through the meteorological and rainfall-runoff forecasts within the spatial and temporal continuity connection, and the copula function accurately described and quantified the multidimensional temporal and spatial dependences of the uncertainties. (2) In neglecting the spatial dependences of forecast uncertainties, the joint flood risk of the reservoir system was underestimated; in ignoring high-order temporal dependences, individual flood risk was underestimated owing to biased estimation in error variance. (3) Systematic reorganization of the operational strategies of diagnosed stable and vulnerable reservoirs could provide guidance for reduction and homogenization of flood risks.

TRUE,343,CLIMATE OF WEST SIBERIA DURING THE SLOWING PHASE OF WARMING (1986-2015) AND PREDICTION OF HYDRO CLIMATIC RESOURCES FOR 2021-2030,"The relevance of the study. The most visible affect of the present climate change is the rise of surface air temperature. Regional and local indicators of climate change differ from the global characteristics. Transformation of the hydrological cycle, water balance, river runoff in its turn affects climate processes. In order to predict the response of geosystems and their hydro-climatic resources to climate change it is necessary to have a clear vision of contemporary climate change and its projections for the coming decades in specific geographical localities. The aim of the study is (1) to assess the climate change over West Siberia on the basis of statistical analysis of monthly air temperature and precipitation time series up to 2015, (2) predict the average air temperature and precipitation fields for the 2021-2030, and (3) determine the climate-driven changes in water balance and water flow regime over the study area. The methods used in the study. Analysis and forecasting of spatial and temporal variability of surface air temperature and precipitation rates at meteorological stations in the region are made by statistical methods in the StatSoft STATISTICA package (regression analysis, trend analysis, cluster analysis to classify objects, exponential smoothing and forecasting). The averaged monthly land water balance constituents are determined for the base (1966-1985), current (1986-2015) and forecast (2021-2030) using the method of hydrological and climatical calculations developed by V.S. Mezentsev. The results. It is shown that the modern 30yrs climatic period differs from the previous one in higher energy level (air temperature). Against this background, not only upward but downward temperature trends in some months are observed. The authors have predicted the average temperatures and precipitation rates in a cold season and monthly temperatures and precipitation in a warm season of the year at 31 meteorological stations for 2021-2030. The estimates for the current and forecast periods made it possible to compute the average regime parametres of precipitation, evapotranspiration, runoff and moisture of soil active layer at the meteorological stantions located in different lanscape zones and regions of West Siberian plain. The projected increase in temperature and evapotranspiration does not lead to the expected decrease in flow even in the southern dry regions.

The river discharge prediction is important for reservoir operations and flood control. This study investigated the usefulness of Climate Forecast System Version 2 (CFSv2) data output to predict the Upper Citarum discharge. We statistically downscaled the CFSv2 output to derive the local climate prediction and then incorporated the result to hydrological model to obtain the discharge prediction. The statistical downscaling method used in this research is Multi Windows Constructed Analogue (CA) method using velocity potential (chi) and stream function (psi) at 850 hPa as predictors and daily rainfall as predictand. The windows used are Australian Monsoon Index (AUSMI) and Western North Pacific Monsoon Index (WNPMI). The daily rainfall prediction was then used as an input for the Soil and Water Assessment Toll (SWAT) hydrological model to generate discharge prediction in the Upper Citarum basin. In this study, we investigated how well the prediction system predict low discharge event of <54.8 m(3)/s which influences the turbine movement in Saguling Power House. Our verifications were done in the period of December-January-February 2011 -2016, using Brier Score and Brier Skill Score. The result showed that CFSv2 is able to represent the event of low discharge event that occurs for 10 to 14 days in one month with good accuracy and skill.

Characterizing the dependent information and conducting spatio-temporal dependent forecast error correction can reduce the total uncertainty in real-time forecasting. On the basis of a single-site martingale model of forecast evolution (MMFE), which can simulate forecast uncertainty evolution over the temporal scale, this study developed a dynamic long-term streamflow probabilistic forecasting model that addresses spatio-temporal dependent error correction for a multisite system. Error characteristics and hybrid spatiotemporal forecast improvements with complex dependencies are captured by Copula function, which describes the systemwide evolution of forecast uncertainty. The proposed model was verified by forecasting the streamflow of the Hongze Lake-Luoma Lake system in China. The results revealed the following. 1) The spatio-temporal dependent error correction based on MMFE can refine the spatio-temporal dimension hybrid error information, which is helpful in improving forecast accuracy. 2) As the spatio-temporal dependence of forecast uncertainty is described using a Copula function, selection of the marginal distribution and connection function is flexible through combining statistical and informational characteristics of the errors, which is helpful in improving the fittedness of complex system error simulation. 3) Compared with the benchmark forecast model without correction, the proposed model greatly decreased forecast uncertainty by reducing the standard deviation of the errors, continuous ranked probability score (CRPS), and Brier score (BS) by nearly 40%, 11.4%, and 34.6%, respectively, and further reduce the CRPS by 2.1% on average (highest value: 3.7%) and reduce the BS by 1.2% on average (highest value: 2.0%) in comparison with only temporal correction.

The NMME-DTVGM drought forecasts have higher detectability and accuracy and lower false alarm rate than the reference forecasts at different lead times (from 1 to 4 months) during the cold-dry season. No apparent advantage is shown in drought predictions during spring and summer seasons because of a long memory of the initial conditions in spring and a lower predictive skill for precipitation in summer.

Ensemble Streamflow Prediction (ESP) is commonly used in the case of long-term lead times (a few months or seasons ahead). ESP covers the use of historical meteorological scenarios in driving a hydrological model to generate an ensemble of possible future streamflow. Many studies have evaluated methods for selecting optimal subsets of scenarios to improve forecasting skill, and indeed, this is still an ongoing area of research. In this study, we propose a procedure that calculates the maximum potential skill of a classic ESP forecast. A genetic algorithm (GA) is used to determine the best possible set of climatological scenarios given any ensemble size. Along with providing a direct estimate of the ESP forecasting potential in hindcast experiments, the method can be used as a reference for comparing other methods to ESP. The procedure is also used to compare classical ESP, a well-established forecasting method, with two new methods, namely, the Analogue method and the Contingency Table (CT) approach. A discriminant analysis is finally implemented to attempt to identify key features of ESP members that performed well as compared to their counterparts using historic climatology and climate indices. It is shown while there exists a potential for improvement, a lot of research must still be realized to exploit this potential. The procedure was tested over two basins in Canada. In general, results showed that for any forecast date, decreasing the ensemble size led to a higher potential for better forecasting skills.

We acquired time series of lake ice breakup and freeze up, local weather conditions, and large-scale climate oscillations from 1981-2015 for seven lakes in northern Wisconsin, USA, and two lakes in Ontario, Canada. Multiple linear regression models were developed to understand the drivers of lake ice phenology. We used projected air temperature and precipitation from 126 climate change scenarios to forecast the day of year of ice breakup and freeze up in 2050 and 2070. Lake ice melted 5 days earlier and froze 8 days later over the past 35 years. Warmer spring and winter air temperatures contributed to earlier ice breakup; whereas warmer November temperatures delayed lake freeze. Lake ice breakup is projected to be 13 days earlier on average by 2070, but could vary by 3 days later to 43 days earlier depending upon the degree of climatic warming by late century. Similarly, the timing of lake freeze up is projected to be delayed by 11 days on average by 2070, but could be 1 to 28 days later.

FALSE,514,Seasonal streamflow forecasts for Europe - Part 2: Sources of skill,"This paper uses hindcasts (1981-2010) to investigate the sources of skill in seasonal hydrological forecasts for Europe. The hindcasts were produced with WUSHP (Wageningen University Seamless Hydrological Prediction system). Skill was identified in a companion paper. In WUSHP, hydrological processes are simulated by running the Variable Infiltration Capacity (VIC) hydrological model forced with an ensemble of bias-corrected output from the seasonal forecast system 4 (S4) of the European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts (ECMWF). We first analysed the meteorological forcing. The precipitation forecasts contain considerable skill for the first lead month but hardly any significant skill at longer lead times. Seasonal forecasts of temperature have more skill. Skill in summer temperature is related to climate change and is more or less independent of lead time. Skill in February and March is unrelated to climate change. Different sources of skill in hydro-meteorological variables were isolated with a suite of specific hydrological hindcasts akin to ensemble streamflow prediction (ESP). These hindcasts show that in Europe, initial conditions of soil moisture (SM) form the dominant source of skill in run-off. From April to July, initial conditions of snow contribute significantly to the skill. Some remarkable skill features are due to indirect effects, i.e. skill due to forcing or initial conditions of snow and soil moisture at an earlier stage is stored in the hydrological state (snow and/or soil moisture) of a later stage, which then contributes to persistence of skill. Skill in evapotranspiration (ET) originates mostly in the meteorological forcing. For run-off we also compared the full hindcasts (with S4 forcing) with two types of ESP (or ESP-like) hindcasts (with identical forcing for all years). Beyond the second lead month, the full hindcasts are less skilful than the ESP (or ESP-like) hindcasts, because inter-annual variations in the S4 forcing consist mainly of noise which enhances degradation of the skill.",https://doi.org/10.5194/hess-23-371-2019,10.5194/hess-23-371-2019,"Greuell, Wouter; Franssen, Wietse H.

TRUE,515,Forecasting distributions of an aquatic invasive species (Nitellopsis obtusa) under future climate scenarios,"Starry stonewort (Nitellopsis obtusa) is an alga that has emerged as an aquatic invasive species of concern in the United States. Where established, starry stonewort can interfere with recreational uses of water bodies and potentially have ecological impacts. Incipient invasion of starry stonewort in Minnesota provides an opportunity to predict future expansion in order to target early detection and strategic management. We used ecological niche models to identify suitable areas for starry stonewort in Minnesota based on global occurrence records and present-day and future climate conditions. We assessed sensitivity of forecasts to different parameters, using four emission scenarios (i.e., RCP 2.6, RCP 4.5, RCP 6, and RCP 8.5) from five future climate models (i.e., CCSM, GISS, IPSL, MIROC, and MRI). From our niche model analyses, we found that (i) occurrences from the entire range, instead of occurrences restricted to the invaded range, provide more informed models; (ii) default settings in Maxent did not provide the best model; (iii) the model calibration area and its background samples impact model performance; (iv) model projections to future climate conditions should be restricted to analogous environments; and (v) forecasts in future climate conditions should include different future climate models and model calibration areas to better capture uncertainty in forecasts. Under present climate, the most suitable areas for starry stonewort are predicted to be found in central and southeastern Minnesota. In the future, suitable areas for starry stonewort are predicted to shift in geographic range under some future climate models and to shrink under others, with most permutations indicating a net decrease of the species' suitable range. Our suitability maps can serve to design shortterm plans for surveillance and education, while future climate models suggest a plausible reduction of starry stonewort spread in the long-term if the trends in climate warming remain.",https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0180930,10.1371/journal.pone.0180930,"Romero-Alvarez, Daniel; Escobar, Luis E.; Varela, Sara; Larkin, Daniel J.; Phelps, Nicholas B.

FALSE,517,Scenario approach for the seasonal forecast of Kharif flows from the Upper Indus Basin,"Snow and glacial melt runoff are the major sources of water contribution from the high mountainous terrain of the Indus River upstream of the Tarbela reservoir. A reliable forecast of seasonal water availability for the Kharif cropping season (April-September) can pave the way towards better water management and a subsequent boost in the agro-economy of Pakistan. The use of degree-day models in conjunction with satellite-based remote-sensing data for the forecasting of seasonal snow and ice melt runoff has proved to be a suitable approach for data-scarce regions. In the present research, the Snowmelt Runoff Model (SRM) has not only been enhanced by incorporating the glacier (G) component but also applied for the forecast of seasonal water availability from the Upper Indus Basin (UIB). Excelbased SRM + G takes account of separate degree-day factors for snow and glacier melt processes. All-year simulation runs with SRM + G for the period 2003-2014 result in an average flow component distribution of 53, 21, and 26% for snow, glacier, and rain, respectively. The UIB has been divided into Upper and Lower parts because of the different climatic conditions in the Tibetan Plateau. The scenario approach for seasonal forecasting, which like the Ensemble Streamflow Prediction method uses historic meteorology as model forcings, has proven to be adequate for long-term water availability forecasts. The accuracy of the forecast with a mean absolute percentage error (MAPE) of 9.5% could be slightly improved compared to two existing operational forecasts for the UIB, and the bias could be reduced to 2.0 %. However, the association between forecasts and observations as well as the skill in predicting extreme conditions is rather weak for all three models, which motivates further research on the selection of a subset of ensemble members according to forecasted seasonal anomalies.",https://doi.org/10.5194/hess-22-1391-2018,10.5194/hess-22-1391-2018,"Ismail, Muhammad Fraz; Bogacki, Wolfgang",HYDROLOGY AND EARTH SYSTEM SCIENCES,NA,SNOW COVER; RIVER-BASIN; PRECIPITATION; VERIFICATION; CLIMATE; MODEL; PREDICTION; HIMALAYA,NA,COPERNICUS GESELLSCHAFT MBH,GOTTINGEN,"BAHNHOFSALLEE 1E, GOTTINGEN, 37081, GERMANY",1027-5606,1607-7938,NA,HYDROL EARTH SYST SC,Hydrol.

FALSE,524,A Stepwise and Dynamic C-Vine Copula-Based Approach for Nonstationary Monthly Streamflow Forecasts,"In recent years, the stationary assumption of hydroclimatic variables as well as their temporal and spatial dependence structure have been challenged due to anthropogenic and climate changes. This study developed a stepwise and dynamic C-vine copula-based conditional model (SDCVC) to incorporate the nonstationarity into a monthly streamflow prediction, which depicted the predictor-predictand association on the basis of monthly streamflow and rainfall series of upstream and downstream stations in the Yangtze River basin of China. The model consists of (1) nonstationary modeling of the margins and nonstationary temporal and spatial dependence structure by the generalized additive models with location, scale, and shape (GAMLSS) and C-vine copula incorporating climate-related indexes as covariates during training time frames; and (2) a four-dimensional C-vine copula-based conditional quantile function to generate the simulated series during validation time frames. Three kinds of nonstationary models corresponding to different degrees were investigated to show the impact of nonstationarity on the streamflow forecasting. The proposed SDCVC model considering highest degree of nonstationarity outperformed the other two nonstationary models in terms of the performance metrics, because the SDCVC model not only described the dynamic change of time-varying connections between parameter and the large-scale climate forcings, but the stepwise strategy, by selecting the optimum time horizon, helped increase forecasting accuracy. Furthermore, the SDCVC model is superior, to some extent, to classical data-driven approaches [support vector regression (SVR) and adaptive-network-based fuzzy inference system (ANFIS)] in terms of the performance metrics.",https://doi.org/10.1061/(ASCE)HE.1943-5584.0002145,10.1061/(ASCE)HE.1943-5584.0002145,"Xu, Pengcheng; Wang, Dong; Wang, Yuankun; Singh, Vijay P.",JOURNAL OF HYDROLOGIC ENGINEERING,Monthly streamflow prediction; Dynamic C-vine copula; Nonstationarity; Generalized additive models with location; scale; and shape (GAMLSS); Climate change,SUPPORT VECTOR REGRESSION; RIVER FLOOD HAZARD; FREQUENCY-ANALYSIS; CLIMATE-CHANGE; YANGTZE-RIVER; MODELS; RAINFALL; PRECIPITATION; PREDICTION; DEPENDENCE,NA,ASCE-AMER SOC CIVIL ENGINEERS,RESTON,"1801 ALEXANDER BELL DR, RESTON, VA 20191-4400 USA",1084-0699,1943-5584,NA,J HYDROL ENG,J.

FALSE,525,Conditioning ensemble streamflow prediction with the North Atlantic Oscillation improves skill at longer lead times,"Skilful hydrological forecasts can benefit decision-making in water resources management and other water-related sectors that require long-term planning. In Ireland, no such service exists to deliver forecasts at the catchment scale. In order to understand the potential for hydrological forecasting in Ireland, we benchmark the skill of ensemble streamflow prediction (ESP) for a diverse sample of 46 catchments using the GR4J (Genie Rural a 4 parametres Journalier) hydrological model. Skill is evaluated within a 52-year hindcast study design over lead times of 1 d to 12 months for each of the 12 initialisation months, January to December. Our results show that ESP is skilful against a probabilistic climatology benchmark in the majority of catchments up to several months ahead. However, the level of skill was strongly dependent on lead time, initialisation month, and individual catchment location and storage properties. Mean ESP skill was found to decay rapidly as a function of lead time, with a continuous ranked probability skill score (CRPSS) of 0.8 (1 d), 0.32 (2-week), 0.18 (1-month), 0.05 (3-month), and 0.01 (12-month). Forecasts were generally more skilful when initialised in summer than other seasons. A strong correlation (rho = 0.94) was observed between forecast skill and catchment storage capacity (baseflow index), with the most skilful regions, the Midlands and the East, being those where slowly responding, high-storage catchments are located. Forecast reliability and discrimination were also assessed with respect to low- and high-flow events. In addition to our benchmarking experiment, we conditioned ESP with the winter North Atlantic Oscillation (NAO) using adjusted hindcasts from the Met Office's Global Seasonal Forecasting System version 5. We found gains in winter forecast skill (CRPSS) of 7 %-18% were possible over lead times of 1 to 3 months and that improved reliability and discrimination make NAO-conditioned ESP particularly effective at forecasting dry winters, a critical season for water resources management. We conclude that ESP is skilful in a number of different contexts and thus should be operationalised in Ireland given its potential benefits for water managers and other stakeholders.",https://doi.org/10.5194/hess-25-4159-2021,10.5194/hess-25-4159-2021,"Donegan, Sean; Murphy, Conor; Harrigan, Shaun; Broderick, Ciaran; Quinn, Daire Foran; Golian, Saeed; Knight, Jeff; Matthews, Tom; Prudhomme, Christel; Scaife, Adam A.; Stringer, Nicky; Wilby, Robert L.",HYDROLOGY AND EARTH SYSTEM SCIENCES,NA,RAINFALL-RUNOFF MODEL; FORECASTING SYSTEM; PROBABILISTIC FORECASTS; HYDROLOGICAL MODELS; SEASONAL FORECASTS; PART 2; PREDICTABILITY; VERIFICATION; PERFORMANCE; CALIBRATION,NA,COPERNICUS GESELLSCHAFT MBH,GOTTINGEN,"BAHNHOFSALLEE 1E, GOTTINGEN, 37081, GERMANY",1027-5606,1607-7938,NA,HYDROL EARTH SYST SC,Hydrol.

FALSE,530,Development of a monthly to seasonal forecast framework tailored to inland waterway transport in central Europe,"Traditionally, navigation-related forecasts in central Europe cover short-to medium-range lead times linked to the travel times of vessels to pass the main waterway bottlenecks leaving the loading ports. Without doubt, this aspect is still essential for navigational users, but in light of the growing political intention to use the free capacity of the inland waterway transport in Europe, additional lead time supporting strategic decisions is more and more in demand. However, no such predictions offering extended lead times of several weeks up to several months currently exist for considerable parts of the European waterway network. This paper describes the set-up of a monthly to seasonal forecasting system for the German stretches of the international waterways of the Rhine, Danube and Elbe rivers. Two competitive forecast approaches have been implemented: the dynamical set-up forces a hydrological model with post-processed outputs from ECMWF general circulation model System 4, whereas the statistical approach is based on the empirical relationship (teleconnection) of global oceanic, climate and regional hydro-meteorological data with river flows. The performance of both forecast methods is evaluated in relation to the climatological forecast (ensemble of historical streamflow) and the well-known ensemble streamflow prediction approach (ESP, ensemble based on historical meteorology) using common performance indicators (correlation coefficient; mean absolute error, skill score; mean squared error, skill score; and continuous ranked probability, skill score) and an impact-based evaluation quantifying the potential economic gain. The following four key findings result from this study: (1) as former studies for other regions of central Europe indicate, the accuracy and/or skill of the meteorological forcing used has a larger effect than the quality of initial hydrological conditions for relevant stations along the German waterways. (2) Despite the predictive limitations on longer lead times in central Europe, this study reveals the existence of a valuable predictability of streamflow on monthly up to seasonal timescales along the Rhine, upper Danube and Elbe waterways, and the Elbe achieves the highest skill and economic value. (3) The more physically based and the statistical approach are able to improve the predictive skills and economic value compared to climatology and the ESP approach. The specific forecast skill highly depends on the forecast location, the lead time and the season. (4) Currently, the statistical approach seems to be most skilful for the three waterways investigated. The lagged relationship between the monthly and/or seasonal streamflow and the climatic and/or oceanic variables vary between 1 month (e.g. local precipitation, temperature and soil moisture) up to 6 months (e.g. sea surface temperature). Besides focusing on improving the forecast methodology, especially by combining the individual approaches, the focus is on developing useful forecast products on monthly to seasonal timescales for waterway transport and to operationalize the related forecasting service.",https://doi.org/10.5194/hess-21-6401-2017,10.5194/hess-21-6401-2017,"Meissner, Dennis; Klein, Bastian; Ionita, Monica",HYDROLOGY AND EARTH SYSTEM SCIENCES,NA,NORTH-ATLANTIC OSCILLATION; SEA-SURFACE TEMPERATURE; RELATIVE ECONOMIC VALUE; LOW-FLOW FORECASTS; ENSEMBLE PREDICTION; RIVER FLOW; UNITED-STATES; 2015 DROUGHT; EL-NINO; SKILL,NA,COPERNICUS GESELLSCHAFT MBH,GOTTINGEN,"BAHNHOFSALLEE 1E, GOTTINGEN, 37081, GERMANY",1027-5606,1607-7938,NA,HYDROL EARTH SYST SC,Hydrol.

Residents, emergency personnel, and water resource managers need to make timely decisions about how and when to prepare. Uncertainty in forecasting is a critical component of this decision-making, but often poses a confounding factor for public and professional understanding of forecast products. A new suite of products from the National Weather Service's Hydrologic Ensemble Forecast System (HEFS) provides short- and long-range forecasts, ranging from 6 h to 1 yr, and shows uncertainty in hydrologic forecasts. To understand how various audiences use and interpret ensemble forecasts showing a range of hydrologic forecast possibilities, a research project was conducted using scenario-based focus groups and surveys with community residents, emergency managers, and water resource managers in West Virginia and Maryland. The research assessed the utility of the HEFS products, identified barriers to proper understanding of the products, and suggested modifications to product design that could improve the understandability and accessibility for a range of users. There was a difference between the residential users' reactions to the HEFS compared to the emergency managers and water resource managers, with the public reacting less favorably to all versions. The emergency managers preferred the revised HEFS products but had suggestions for additional changes, which were incorporated.

We present a simple, low-cost, and robust approach for forecasting monthly and yearly streamflows during the current hydrological year, which is applicable to headwater catchments. The procedure innovatively combines the use of well-known regression analysis techniques, the two-parameter Gamma continuous cumulative probability distribution function and the Monte Carlo method. Several model performance statistics metrics (including the Coefficient of Determination R-2; the Root-Mean-Square Error RMSE; the Mean Absolute Error MAE; the Index of Agreement IOA; the Mean Absolute Percent Error MAPE; the Coefficient of Nash-Sutcliffe Efficiency NSE; and the Inclusion Coefficient IC) were used and the results showed good levels of accuracy (improving as the number of observed months increases). The model forecast outputs are the mean monthly and yearly streamflows along with the 10th and 90th percentiles. The methodology has been successfully applied to two headwater reservoirs within the Guadalquivir River Basin in southern Spain, achieving an accuracy of 92% and 80% in March 2017.

Extreme fluctuation in water levels in rivers, such as floods and droughts, are catastrophic in every manner; therefore, forecasting at an early stage would prevent possible disasters and relief efforts could be set up on time. This study aims to digitally model the water level in the Kabul River to prevent and alleviate the effects of any change in water level in this river downstream. This study used a machine learning tool known as the automatic autoregressive integrated moving average for statistical methodological analysis for forecasting the river flow. Based on the hydrological data collected from the water level of Kabul River in Swat, the water levels from 2011-2030 were forecasted, which were based on the lowest value of Akaike Information Criterion as 9.216. It was concluded that the water flow started to increase from the year 2011 till it reached its peak value in the year 2019-2020, and then the water level will maintain its maximum level to 250 cumecs and minimum level to 10 cumecs till 2030. The need for this research is justified as it could prove helpful in establishing guidelines for hydrological designers, the planning and management of water, hydropower engineering projects, as an indicator for weather prediction, and for the people who are greatly dependent on the Kabul River for their survival.",https://doi.org/10.3390/su131910720,10.3390/su131910720,"Musarat, Muhammad Ali; Alaloul, Wesam Salah; Rabbani, Muhammad Babar Ali; Ali, Mujahid; Altaf, Muhammad; Fediuk, Roman; Vatin, Nikolai; Klyuev, Sergey; Bukhari, Hamna; Sadiq, Alishba; Rafiq, Waqas; Farooq, Waqas",SUSTAINABILITY,ARIMA; Kabul River; machine learning; floods; droughts; forecasting,MODEL SELECTION; WATER-QUALITY; RUNOFF; COOPERATION; AFGHANISTAN; MANAGEMENT; CONFLICT; WAVELET; BASIN; RMSE,NA,MDPI,BASEL,"ST ALBAN-ANLAGE 66, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND",NA,2071-1050,NA,SUSTAINABILITY-BASEL,Sustainability,OCT,2021,13,19,NA,NA,10720,NA
FALSE,551,Multi-temporal Hydrological Residual Error Modeling for Seamless Subseasonal Streamflow Forecasting,"Subseasonal streamflow forecasts, with lead times of 1-30 days, provide valuable information for operational water resource management. This paper introduces the multi-temporal hydrological residual error (MuTHRE) model to address the challenge of obtaining seamless subseasonal forecasts - that is, daily forecasts with consistent high-quality performance over multiple lead times (1-30 days) and aggregation scales (daily to monthly). The key advance of the MuTHRE model is combining the representation of three temporal characteristics of hydrological residual errors: seasonality, dynamic biases, and non-Gaussian errors. The MuTHRE model is applied in 11 Australian catchments using the hydrological model GR4J and post processed rainfall forecasts from the numerical weather prediction model ACCESS-S, and is evaluated against a baseline model that does not model these error characteristics. The MuTHRE model provides high improvements (practically significant in the majority of performance stratifications) in terms of reliability: (i) at short lead times (up to 10 days), due to representing non-Gaussian errors, (ii) stratified by month, due to representing seasonality in hydrological errors, and (iii) in dry years, due to representing dynamic biases in hydrological errors. Forecast performance also improves in terms of sharpness, volumetric bias, and CRPS skill score; these improvements are statistically but not practically significant in the majority of stratifications. Importantly, improvements are consistent across multiple time scales (daily and monthly). This study highlights the benefits of modeling multiple temporal characteristics of hydrological errors and demonstrates the power of the MuTHRE model for producing seamless subseasonal streamflow forecasts that can be utilized for a wide range of applications.",https://doi.org/10.1029/2019WR026979,10.1029/2019WR026979,"McInerney, David; Thyer, Mark; Kavetski, Dmitri; Laugesen, Richard; Tuteja, Narendra; Kuczera, George",WATER RESOURCES RESEARCH,subseasonal streamflow forecasts; seamless forecasts; probabilistic forecasts; residual error model; streamflow postprocessing,PARAMETER-ESTIMATION; SERVICE HEFS; ENSEMBLE; PREDICTION; RUNOFF; RANGE; UNCERTAINTY; CALIBRATION; INFERENCE; SKILL,NA,AMER GEOPHYSICAL UNION,WASHINGTON,"2000 FLORIDA AVE NW, WASHINGTON, DC 20009 USA",0043-1397,1944-7973,NA,WATER RESOUR RES,Water Resour.

TRUE,554,Input selection and performance optimization of ANN-based streamflow forecasts in the drought-prone Murray Darling Basin region using IIS and MODWT algorithm,"Forecasting streamflow is vital for strategically planning, utilizing and redistributing water resources. In this paper, a wavelet-hybrid artificial neural network (ANN) model integrated with iterative input selection (IIS) algorithm (IIS-W-ANN) is evaluated for its statistical preciseness in forecasting monthly streamflow, and it is then benchmarked against M5 Tree model. To develop hybrid IIS-W-ANN model, a global predictor matrix is constructed for three local hydrological sites (Richmond, Gwydir, and Darling River) in Australia's agricultural (Murray-Darling) Basin. Model inputs comprised of statistically significant lagged combination of streamflow water level, are supplemented by meteorological data (i.e., precipitation, maximum and minimum temperature, mean solar radiation, vapor pressure and evaporation) as the potential model inputs. To establish robust forecasting models, iterative input selection (US) algorithm is applied to screen the best data from the predictor matrix and is integrated with the non-decimated maximum overlap discrete wavelet transform (MODWT) applied on the IIS-selected variables. This resolved the frequencies contained in predictor data while constructing a wavelet-hybrid (i.e., IIS-W-ANN and IIS-W-M5 Tree) model. Forecasting ability of US-W-ANN is evaluated via correlation coefficient (r), Willmott's Index (WI), Nash-Sutcliffe Efficiency (E-NS), root-mean-square-error (RMSE), and mean absolute error (MAE), including the percentage RMSE and MAE. While ANN models are seen to outperform M5 Tree executed for all hydrological sites, the IIS variable selector was efficient in determining the appropriate predictors, as stipulated by the better performance of the IIS coupled (ANN and M5 Tree) models relative to the models without IIS. When IIS-coupled models are integrated with MODWT, the wavelet-hybrid IIS-W-ANN and IIS-W-M5 Tree are seen to attain significantly accurate performance relative to their standalone counterparts. Importantly, IIS-W-ANN model accuracy outweighs IIS-ANN, as evidenced by a larger r and WI (by 7.5% and 3.8%, respectively) and a lower RMSE (by 21.3%). In comparison to the IIS-W-M5 Tree model, IIS-W-ANN model yielded larger values of WI = 0.936-0.979 and E-NS = 0.770-0.920. Correspondingly, the errors (RMSE and MAE) ranged from 0.162-0.487 m and 0.139-0.390 m, respectively, with relative errors, RRMSE = (15.65-21.00) % and MAPE = (14.79-20.78) %. Distinct geographic signature is evident where the most and least accurately forecasted streamflow data is attained for the Gwydir and Darling River, respectively. Conclusively, this study advocates the efficacy of iterative input selection, allowing the proper screening of model predictors, and subsequently, its integration with MODWT resulting in enhanced performance of the models applied in streamflow forecasting.",https://doi.org/10.1016/j.atmosres.2017.06.014,10.1016/j.atmosres.2017.06.014,"Prasad, Ramendra; Deo, Ravinesh C.; Li, Yan; Maraseni, Tek",ATMOSPHERIC RESEARCH,"Wavelet-hybrid model; Streamflow forecasting; Drought in Murray-Darling Basin; Iterative input selection algorithm, MODWT",SUPPORT VECTOR MACHINE; ARTIFICIAL NEURAL-NETWORK; DISCRETE WAVELET TRANSFORM; GLOBAL SOLAR-RADIATION; M5 MODEL TREES; VARIABLE SELECTION; PARTICLE SWARM; AUSTRALIAN RAINFALL; UPPER REACH; SHORT-TERM,NA,ELSEVIER SCIENCE INC,NEW YORK,"STE 800, 230 PARK AVE, NEW YORK, NY 10169 USA",0169-8095,1873-2895,NA,ATMOS RES,Atmos.

FALSE,566,"Hybrid forecasting model for non-stationary daily runoff series: A case study in the Han River Basin, China","Accurate and reliable short-term runoff prediction is of great significance to the management of water resources optimization and reservoir flood operation. In order to improve the accuracy of short-term runoff forecasting, a hybrid model-based feature decomposition-learning reconstruction named VMD-DBN-IPSO was proposed. In this paper, variational mode decomposition (VMD) is first used to decompose the original daily runoff series into a set of sub-sequence for improving the frequency resolution. Partial autocorrelation function (PACF) is then applied to determine the input variables of each sub-sequence. The improved particle swarm optimization (IPSO) algorithm is combined with the deep belief network (DBN) model to predict each sub-sequences and finally reconstruct the ensemble forecasting result. Three quantitative evaluation indicators, mean absolute error (MAE), root mean square error (RMSE) and Nash-Sutcliffe efficiency coefficient (NSE), were used to evaluate and compare the established models using the historical daily runoff data (1/1/1988-31/12/2017) at Yangxian and Ankang hydrological station in the Han River Basin of China. Meanwhile, a comparative analysis of the performance of VMD-DBN-IPSO model under different forecast periods (1-, 3-, 5- and 7-day lead time) was performed. In addition, the prediction ability of peak runoff of the VMD-DBN-IPSO model is further verified by analyzing the 10 peak flows during the testing data-series. The results indicate that the VMD-DBN-IPSO model can always achieve the best performance in the training and testing stage, and has good stability and representativeness, the NSE coefficient remains above 0.8, and the prediction error of peak flow is within 20%.

FALSE,567,Forecasting monthly fluctuations of lake surface areas using remote sensing techniques and novel machine learning methods,"Drought is one of the most environmentally impactful hydrologic processes with devastating economic consequences for many rural communities in arid and semi-arid countries all over the world. In this research, we have employed satellite data and a stochastic approach for forecasting the changes in lake surface areas and demonstrated for the application of the new technique for the case study of the Lake Gregory in Australia. High-resolution Landsat satellite images are used on a monthly time scale from Landsat 5, 7, and 8, on days that are not cloudy. The software ENVI 5.3, using normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI), and modify normalized difference water index (MNDWI) indices were employed to obtain the lake surface maps, and satellite images have been split into water and non-water using a decision tree. The ArcGIS 10.3 software was used to calculate the area of the Lake monthly. The overall trend data shows that from 2004 to 2019, the LS is steadily declining, reaching its lowest area in 2019.The TRMM satellite monthly precipitation (P) and temperature (T) measurement were obtained to investigate the correlation between these changes and regional precipitation. We developed a novel generalized group method of data handling (GGMDH) to forecast lake surface (LS) fluctuations, in which the LS time-series database is extracted from the satellite imagery. For downscaling, precipitation and three different scenarios are defined based on climate change projections to forecast the LS in the 2020-2060 period. The comparison of the GGMDH with stochastic models integrated with preprocessing scenarios indicates the GGMDH in long-term LS forecasting outperforms the stochastic model. The result showed GGMDH is the best model among other ones to modeling lake surface by R-2 (%) = 94.16, RMSE = 8.77 for the forecasting stage.

FALSE,572,Impact of the quality of hydrological forecasts on the management and revenue of hydroelectric reservoirs - a conceptual approach,"The improvement of a forecasting system and the continuous evaluation of its quality are recurrent steps in operational practice. However, the systematic evaluation of forecast value or usefulness for better decision-making is less frequent, even if it is also essential to guide strategic planning and investments. In the hydropower sector, several operational systems use medium-range hydrometeorological forecasts (up to 7-10 d ahead) and energy price predictions as input to models that optimize hydropower production. The operation of hydropower systems, including the management of water stored in reservoirs, is thus partially impacted by weather and hydrological conditions. Forecast value can be quantified by the economic gains obtained with the optimization of operations informed by the forecasts. In order to assess how much improving the quality of hydrometeorological forecasts will improve their economic value, it is essential to understand how the system and its optimization model are sensitive to sequences of input forecasts of different quality. This paper investigates the impact of 7 d streamflow forecasts of different quality on the management of hydroelectric reservoirs and the economic gains generated from a linear programming optimization model. The study is based on a conceptual approach. Flows from 10 catchments in France are synthetically generated over a 4-year period to obtain forecasts of different quality in terms of accuracy and reliability. These forecasts define the inflows to 10 hydroelectric reservoirs, which are conceptually parameterized. Relationships between forecast quality and economic value (hydropower revenue) show that forecasts with a recurrent positive bias (overestimation) and low accuracy generate the highest economic losses when compared to the reference management system where forecasts are equal to observed inflows. The smallest losses are observed for forecast systems with underdispersion reliability bias, while forecast systems with negative bias (underestimation) show intermediate losses. Overall, the losses (which amount to millions of Euros) represent approximately 1% to 3% of the revenue over the study period. Besides revenue, the quality of the forecasts also impacts spillage, stock evolution, production hours and production rates, with systematic over- and underestimations being able to generate some extreme reservoir management situations.",https://doi.org/10.5194/hess-25-1033-2021,10.5194/hess-25-1033-2021,"Cassagnole, Manon; Ramos, Maria-Helena; Zalachori, Ioanna; Thirel, Guillaume; Garcon, Remy; Gailhard, Joel; Ouillon, Thomas",HYDROLOGY AND EARTH SYSTEM SCIENCES,NA,ENSEMBLE PREDICTION; ECONOMIC VALUE; PROBABILISTIC FORECASTS; HYDROPOWER SYSTEM; DECISION-MAKING; OPTIMIZATION; STREAMFLOW; INFORMATION; MODELS; SKILL,NA,COPERNICUS GESELLSCHAFT MBH,GOTTINGEN,"BAHNHOFSALLEE 1E, GOTTINGEN, 37081, GERMANY",1027-5606,1607-7938,NA,HYDROL EARTH SYST SC,Hydrol.

FALSE,587,Statistical forecast of seasonal discharge in Central Asia using observational records: development of a generic linear modelling tool for operational water resource management,"The semi-arid regions of Central Asia crucially depend on the water resources supplied by the mountainous areas of the Tien Shan and Pamir and Altai mountains. During the summer months the snow-melt-and glacier-melt-dominated river discharge originating in the mountains provides the main water resource available for agricultural production, but also for storage in reservoirs for energy generation during the winter months. Thus a reliable seasonal forecast of the water resources is crucial for sustainable management and planning of water resources. In fact, seasonal forecasts are mandatory tasks of all national hydro-meteorological services in the region. In order to support the operational seasonal forecast procedures of hydro-meteorological services, this study aims to develop a generic tool for deriving statistical forecast models of seasonal river discharge based solely on observational records. The generic model structure is kept as simple as possible in order to be driven by meteorological and hydrological data readily available at the hydro-meteorological services, and to be applicable for all catchments in the region. As snow melt dominates summer runoff, the main meteorological predictors for the forecast models are monthly values of winter precipitation and temperature, satellite-based snow cover data, and antecedent discharge. This basic predictor set was further extended by multi-monthly means of the individual predictors, as well as composites of the predictors. Forecast models are derived based on these predictors as linear combinations of up to four predictors. A user-selectable number of the best models is extracted automatically by the developed model fitting algorithm, which includes a test for robustness by a leave-one-out cross-validation. Based on the cross-validation the predictive uncertainty was quantified for every prediction model. Forecasts of the mean seasonal discharge of the period April to September are derived every month from January until June. The application of the model for several catchments in Central Asia - ranging from small to the largest rivers (240 to 290 000 km(2) catchment area) for the period 2000-2015 provided skilful forecasts for most catchments already in January, with adjusted R-2 values of the best model in the range of 0.6-0.8 for most of the catchments. The skill of the prediction increased every following month, i.e. with reduced lead time, with adjusted R-2 values usually in the range 0.8-0.9 for the best and 0.7-0.8 on average for the set of models in April just before the prediction period. The later forecasts in May and June improve further due to the high predictive power of the discharge in the first 2 months of the snow melt period. The improved skill of the set of forecast models with decreasing lead time resulted in narrow predictive uncertainty bands at the beginning of the snow melt period. In summary, the proposed generic automatic forecast model development tool provides robust predictions for seasonal water availability in Central Asia, which will be tested against the official forecasts in the upcoming years, with the vision of operational implementation.",https://doi.org/10.5194/hess-22-2225-2018,10.5194/hess-22-2225-2018,"Apel, Heiko; Abdykerimova, Zharkinay; Agalhanova, Marina; Baimaganbetov, Azamat; Gavrilenko, Nadejda; Gerlitz, Lars; Kalashnikova, Olga; Unger-Shayesteh, Katy; Vorogushyn, Sergiy; Gafurov, Abror",HYDROLOGY AND EARTH SYSTEM SCIENCES,NA,PRECIPITATION CLIMATE; DOMINATED CATCHMENTS; METEOROLOGICAL DATA; TARIM RIVER; RUNOFF; SNOW; MELT; PREDICTABILITY; GLACIERS; BASIN,NA,COPERNICUS GESELLSCHAFT MBH,GOTTINGEN,"BAHNHOFSALLEE 1E, GOTTINGEN, 37081, GERMANY",1027-5606,1607-7938,NA,HYDROL EARTH SYST SC,Hydrol.

FALSE,588,The multi temporal/multi-model approach to predictive uncertainty assessment in real-time flood forecasting,"This work extends the multi-temporal approach of the Model Conditional Processor (MCP-MT) to the multi-model case and to the four Truncated Normal Distributions (TNDs) approach, demonstrating the improvement on the single-temporal one. The study is framed in the context of probabilistic Bayesian decision-making that is appropriate to take rational decisions on uncertain future outcomes. As opposed to the direct use of deterministic forecasts, the probabilistic forecast identifies a predictive probability density function that represents a fundamental knowledge on future occurrences. The added value of MCP-MT is the identification of the probability that a critical situation will happen within the forecast lead-time and when, more likely, it will occur. MCP-MT is thoroughly tested for both single-model and multi-model configurations at a gauged site on the Tiber River, central Italy. The stages forecasted by two operative deterministic models, STAFOM-RCM and MISDc, are considered for the study. The dataset used for the analysis consists of hourly data from 34 flood events selected on a time series of six years. MCP-MT improves over the original models' forecasts: the peak overestimation and the rising limb delayed forecast, characterizing MISDc and STAFOM-RCM respectively, are significantly mitigated, with a reduced mean error on peak stage from 45 to 5 cm and an increased coefficient of persistence from 0.53 up to 0.75. The results show that MCP-MT outperforms the single-temporal approach and is potentially useful for supporting decision-making because the exceedance probability of hydrometric thresholds within a forecast horizon and the most probable flooding time can be estimated.

Optimally managing these resources depends on predicting water availability. We built a probabilistic nonlinear regression water supply forecast (WSF) technique for the US Department of Agriculture, which runs the largest stand-alone WSF system in the US West. Design criteria included improved accuracy over the existing system; uncertainty estimates that seamlessly handle complex (heteroscedastic, non-Gaussian) prediction errors; integration of physical hydrometeorological process knowledge and domain-specific expert experience; ability to accommodate nonlinearity, model selection uncertainty and equifinality, and predictor multicollinearity and high dimensionality; and relatively easy, low-cost implementation. Some methods satisfied some of these requirements but none met all, leading us to develop a novel, interdisciplinary, and pragmatic prediction metasystem through a carefully considered synthesis of well-established, off-the-shelf components and approaches, spanning supervised and unsupervised machine learning, nonparametric statistical modeling, ensemble learning, and evolutionary optimization, focusing on maintaining but radically updating the principal components regression framework widely used for WSF. Testing this integrated multi-method prediction engine demonstrated its value for river forecasting; USDA adoption is a landmark for transitioning machine learning from research into practice in this field.

TRUE,591,THE FORECASTING OF WATER RUNOFF OF THE STYR RIVER FOR THE COMING YEARS,"Formulation of the problem. The water flow of the Styr River is using for the needs of industry, agriculture and the population. Thus, forecasting the water flow of this river for the future is an important scientific and practical task. The hydrological forecasts that have a lead time of one year, two years, or a decade are not as reliable as they need to be. Now in the world this problem is not solved. Along with quantitative forecasting methods, the qualitative methods have also been developed. The method of commensurability refers to such methods. It was developed by Chinese geophysicist Weng Wen-Bo in 1984. The commensurability method supports prediction of various natural phenomena, including floods and other dangerous events. The objective of this paper is to use the Weng Wen-Bo method for long-term water flow forecasting of the Styr River at Lutsk city. Methods. The commensurability method uses the dates on which natural phenomena (earthquakes, floods, droughts, etc.) were observed. For this reason, it has been called the information method. It is characterized by simplicity of calculation, graphical visualization, the use of researcher intuition and minimum needs for input information. There are several ways of forecasting using the method of commensurability. This paper is used a method of forecasting by two-dimensional commensurability graphs. Such approach consists in the determining the commensurability values in the dates array of certain phenomena occurrence and creating a two-dimensional graph of commensurability, according to which forecasting occurs. The use of such a method allows determining the years that may be wet and dry in the near future. Results. The data of observations at the hydrological station of the Styr River - Lutsk city for the period 1923-2017 are used in the paper. The results of the study on the commensurability method show that the water flow of the river Styr in 2020-2021 should be more than the norm and in 2023-2024 - less than the norm. Scientific novelty and practical significance. In Ukraine the commensurability method was used for the first time for long-term forecasting of water flow for coming years. The estimating of the effectiveness of forecasting by the commensurability method requires an array of long-term forecasts. Therefore, the next step of the study should be to forecast of water flow on different rivers, but provided that they have the long series of observation. The results of the long-term forecasting will enable the relevant services the negative consequences of a hydrological phenomenon, such as low water flow or floods on rivers will prevent.",https://doi.org/10.26565/2410-7360-2021-54-12,10.26565/2410-7360-2021-54-12,"Gorbachova, Liudmyla; Khrystiuk, Borys",VISNYK OF V N KARAZIN KHARKIV NATIONAL UNIVERSITY-SERIES GEOLOGY GEOGRAPHY ECOLOGY,water flow; commensurability method; long-term forecasting; wet year; dry year,FLOODS,NA,V N KARAZIN KHARKIV NATL UNIV,KHARKIV,"4, SVOBODY SQ, KHARKIV, 61022, UKRAINE",2410-7360,2411-3913,NA,VISN V N KKNU-GEOL G,Visn.

FALSE,593,Contribution of potential evaporation forecasts to 10-day streamflow forecast skill for the Rhine River,"Medium-term hydrologic forecast uncertainty is strongly dependent on the forecast quality of meteorological variables. Of these variables, the influence of precipitation has been studied most widely, while temperature, radiative forcing and their derived product potential evapotranspiration (PET) have received little attention from the perspective of hydrological forecasting. This study aims to fill this gap by assessing the usability of potential evaporation forecasts for 10-day-ahead streamflow forecasting in the Rhine basin, Europe. In addition, the forecasts of the meteorological variables are compared with observations. Streamflow reforecasts were performed with the daily wflow_hbv model used in previous studies of the Rhine using the ECMWF 20-year meteorological reforecast dataset. Meteorological forecasts were compared with observed rainfall, temperature, global radiation and potential evaporation for 148 subbasins. Secondly, the effect of using PET climatology versus using observation-based estimates of PET was assessed for hydrological state and for streamflow forecast skill. We find that (1) there is considerable skill in the ECMWF reforecasts to predict PET for all seasons, and (2) using dynamical PET forcing based on observed temperature and satellite global radiation estimates results in lower evaporation and wetter initial states, but (3) the effect on forecasted 10-day streamflow is limited. Implications of this finding are that it is reasonable to use meteorological forecasts to forecast potential evaporation and use this is in mediumrange streamflow forecasts. However, it can be concluded that an approach using PET climatology is also sufficient, most probably not only for the application shown here, but also for most models similar to the HBV concept and for moderate climate zones. As a by-product, this research resulted in gridded datasets for temperature, radiation and potential evaporation based on the Makkink equation for the Rhine basin. The datasets have a spatial resolution of 1.2 x 1.2 km and an hourly time step for the period from July 1996 through 2015.

FALSE,602,Performance of Post-Processed Methods in Hydrological Predictions Evaluated by Deterministic and Probabilistic Criteria,"Meteorological Ensemble Streamflow Prediction (ESP), which uses Ensemble Weather forecasts (EWFs) to drive hydrological models, is a useful methodology for extending forecast periods and to provide valuable uncertainty information to improve the operation of future water resources. However, raw EWFs are usually biased and under-dispersive and so cannot be directly used in ESP, leading to the development of several post-processing methods. The performance of these methods needs to be evaluated/compared in building ESP based on deterministic and probabilistic criteria. In addition, likely influencing factors also need to be identified. This study evaluated the performance of four state-of-the-art methods: the Generator-based Post-Processing (GPP) method, Extended Logistic Regression (ExLR), Bayesian Model Averaging (BMA) and Affine Kernel Dressing (AKD), using a simple bias correction (BC) method as a benchmark. The evaluation was carried out over four watersheds with different basin areas in the humid region of central-south China based on the weather reforecasts from the Global Ensemble Forecasting System (GEFS). The results show that the performance of the post-processing methods varies with the forecast variable (precipitation, or air temperature or streamflow), but all of them outperform the BC and GEFS. For the four post-processing methods, the advantage of the generator-based methods (GPP and ExLR) lies in their probabilistic performance, which outperforms the distribution-based methods (BMA and AKD) by about 10% in precipitation forecasts and about 20% in streamflow forecasts, while the distribution-based methods (BMA and AKD) are better at their deterministic performance for precipitation forecasts, with a benefit of about 15%. Meanwhile, the post-processing methods generally perform better for precipitation and streamflow forecasts, but worse for air temperature forecasts for a bigger basin compared to the distribution-based methods.

This study is based on two years (2015-2016) of rain estimates from a dual-polarization S-band Doppler weather radar (SPOL) and flood locations observed by the Climate Emergency Management Center (CGE) of Sao Paulo City Hall. The logistic regression model is based on daily accumulated precipitation, a maximum precipitation rate, and daily rainfall duration. The model presented a probability of detection (POD) of 46% (71%) on average for flood events (conditional), while, for events without flash flood, it reached 98% probability.

FALSE,608,Seasonal drought predictability and forecast skill in the semi-arid endorheic Heihe River basin in northwestern China,"Endorheic and arid regions around the world are suffering from serious drought problems. In this study, a drought forecasting system based on eight state-of-the-art climate models from the North American Multi-Model Ensemble (NMME) and a Distributed Time-Variant Gain Hydrological Model (DTVGM) was established and assessed over the upstream and midstream of Heihe River basin (UHRB and MHRB), a typical arid endorheic basin. The 3-month Standardized Precipitation Index (SPI3) and 1-month Standardized Streamflow Index (SSI1) were used to capture meteorological and hydrological drought, and values below - 1 indicate drought events. The skill of the forecasting systems was evaluated in terms of anomaly correlation (AC) and Brier score (BS) or Brier skill score (BSS). The predictability for meteorological drought was quantified using AC and BS with a perfect model assumption, referring to the upper limit of forecast skill. The hydrological predictability was to distinguish the role of initial hydrological conditions (ICs) and meteorological forcings, which was quantified by root-mean-square error (RMSE) within the ESP (Ensemble Streamflow Prediction) and reverse ESP framework. The UHRB and MHRB showed season-dependent meteorological drought predictability and forecast skill, with higher values during winter and autumn than that during spring. For hydrological forecasts, the forecast skill in the UHRB was higher than that in MHRB. Predicting meteorological droughts more than 2 months in advance became difficult because of complex climate mechanisms. However, the hydrological drought forecasts could show some skills up to 3-6 lead months due to memory of ICs during cold and dry sea-sons. During wet seasons, there are no skillful hydrological predictions from lead month 2 onwards because of the dominant role of meteorological forcings. During spring, the improvement of hydrological drought predictions was the most significant as more streamflow was generated by seasonal snowmelt. Besides meteorological forcings and ICs, human activities have reduced the hydrological variability and increased hydrological drought predictability during the wet seasons in the MHRB.",https://doi.org/10.5194/hess-22-5697-2018,10.5194/hess-22-5697-2018,"Ma, Feng; Luo, Lifeng; Ye, Aizhong; Duan, Qingyun",HYDROLOGY AND EARTH SYSTEM SCIENCES,NA,CLIMATE-CHANGE; HYDROLOGICAL DROUGHT; UNITED-STATES; PREDICTION; FRAMEWORK; TEMPERATURE; SIMULATION; SYSTEM,NA,COPERNICUS GESELLSCHAFT MBH,GOTTINGEN,"BAHNHOFSALLEE 1E, GOTTINGEN, 37081, GERMANY",1027-5606,1607-7938,NA,HYDROL EARTH SYST SC,Hydrol.

FALSE,609,Understanding the Impact of Observation Data Uncertainty on Probabilistic Streamflow Forecasts Using a Dynamic Hierarchical Model,"Earlier researches have proposed algorithms to quantify the measurement uncertainty in rating curves and found that the magnitude of the uncertainty can be significant enough to impact hydrologic modeling. Therefore, they suggested frameworks to include measurement uncertainty in the rating curve to make it robust. Despite their efforts, a robust rating curve is often ignored in traditional practices, considering the investment of time and money as well as the resulting benefit from it. In the current research, we are interested in understanding the role of the measurement error variance in real-time streamflow forecasting. Our objectives are (i) to employ a state-of-the-art statistical forecasting model that can handle measurement uncertainty in daily streamflow and (ii) to understand the trade-off in forecasting performance when substantial knowledge regarding the measurement uncertainty is provided to the modeler. We apply the Bayesian dynamic hierarchical model (BDHM) on four gauging sites in the United States. Results show that the BDHM performs better than the daily climatology and local linear regression model. Also, the forecast variance changes proportionally with the change in the error variance as an input in the observation equation. Following this, we design a simulation-based study, which assigns the measurement error in the reported streamflow to obtain multiple realizations of the true streamflow. The inclusion of substantial knowledge about the true error improves the BDHM's performance by lowering the CRPS (continuous rank probability score) values. However, the inclusion increases the forecast variance to bring the true streamflow within the sampling variability of the forecasted streamflow. Overall, an improved trade-off between the success rate of forecasts and the forecast variance can be achieved by including the measurement error in the BDHM for rivers that witness less dispersed streamflow data. Plain Language Summary Rating curve uncertainty is one of the major sources of measurement uncertainty in reported streamflow. It occurs when a precalibrated stage-discharge relationship curve is used to indirectly measure the streamflow volume based on river stage measurement. Considering the cost and time involved to include the uncertainty in reported streamflow, rating curve uncertainty is often ignored in traditional streamflow modeling practices. The current study adopts a state-of-the-art statistical model that can include rating curve uncertainty while issuing daily streamflow forecasts 1 to 3 days in advance. The study found that a proper knowledge of rating curve uncertainty at a gauge site significantly improves the forecasting of true streamflow. Key Points Bayesian dynamic hierarchical model (BDHM) can include the measurement uncertainty that has a substantial impact on real-time forecasting BDHM efficiently predicts the reported streamflow 1 to 3 days in advance while compared with the daily climatology and a semiparametric forecasting model Knowledge of the measurement uncertainty improves the overall performance of BDHM in predicting the true streamflows",https://doi.org/10.1029/2019WR025463,10.1029/2019WR025463,"Das Bhowmik, Rajarshi; Ng, Tze Ling; Wang, Jui-Pin",WATER RESOURCES RESEARCH,uncertainty; measurement error; Bayesian; BDHM; forecasting; Streamflow,RATING-CURVE UNCERTAINTY; RIVER DISCHARGE; FLOOD; CALIBRATION; ERROR; SCORE,NA,AMER GEOPHYSICAL UNION,WASHINGTON,"2000 FLORIDA AVE NW, WASHINGTON, DC 20009 USA",0043-1397,1944-7973,NA,WATER RESOUR RES,Water Resour.

The use of data produced by untrained people into flood forecasting models may effectively allow Early Warning Systems (EWS) to better perform while support decision-making to reduce the fatalities and economic losses due to inundation hazard. In this work, we develop a Data Assimilation (DA) method integrating Volunteered Geographic Information (VGI) and a 2D hydraulic model and we test its performances. The proposed framework seeks to extend the capabilities and performances of standard DA works, based on the use of traditional in situ sensors, by assimilating VGI while managing and taking into account the uncertainties related to the quality, and the location and timing of the entire set of observational data. The November 2012 flood in the Italian Tiber River basin was selected as the case study. Results show improvements of the model in terms of uncertainty with a significant persistence of the model updating after the integration of the VGI, even in the case of use of few-selected observations gathered from social media.

A post-processor like the Ensemble Pre-Processor (EPP) developed by U.S. National Weather Service must be used to remove various biases and to extract useful predictive information from those forecasts, In this paper, we investigate how different designs of canonical events in the EPP can help post-process precipitation forecasts from the Global Ensemble Forecast System (GEFS) and Climate Forecast System Version 2 (CFSv2). The use of canonical events allow those products to be linked seamlessly and then the post-processed ensemble precipitation forecasts can be generated using the Schaake Shuffle procedure. We used the post-processed ensemble precipitation forecasts to drive a distributed hydrological model to obtain ensemble streamflow forecasts and evaluated those forecasts against the observed streamflow. We found that the careful design of canonical events can help extract more useful information, especially when up-to-date observed precipitation is used to setup the canonical events. We also found that streamflow forecasts using post-processed precipitation forecasts have longer lead times and higher accuracy than streamflow forecasts made by traditional Extend Streamflow Prediction (ESP) and the forecasts based on original GEFS and CFSv2 precipitation forecasts.

FALSE,617,Assessment of an ensemble seasonal streamflow forecasting system for Australia,"Despite an increasing availability of skilful longrange streamflow forecasts, many water agencies still rely on simple resampled historical inflow sequences (stochastic scenarios) to plan operations over the coming year. We assess a recently developed forecasting system called forecast guided stochastic scenarios (FoGSS) as a skilful alternative to standard stochastic scenarios for the Australian continent. FoGSS uses climate forecasts from a coupled oceanland-atmosphere prediction system, post-processed with the method of calibration, bridging and merging. Ensemble rainfall forecasts force a monthly rainfall-runoff model, while a staged hydrological error model quantifies and propagates hydrological forecast uncertainty through forecast lead times. FoGSS is able to generate ensemble streamflow forecasts in the form of monthly time series to a 12-month forecast horizon. FoGSS is tested on 63 Australian catchments that cover a wide range of climates, including 21 ephemeral rivers. In all perennial and many ephemeral catchments, FoGSS provides an effective alternative to resampled historical inflow sequences. FoGSS generally produces skilful forecasts at shorter lead times (< 4 months), and transits to climatologylike forecasts at longer lead times. Forecasts are generally reliable and unbiased. However, FoGSS does not perform well in very dry catchments (catchments that experience zero flows more than half the time in some months), sometimes producing strongly negative forecast skill and poor reliability. We attempt to improve forecasts through the use of (i) ESP rainfall forcings, (ii) different rainfall-runoff mod-els, and (iii) a Bayesian prior to encourage the error model to return climatology forecasts in months when the rainfallrunoff model performs poorly. Of these, the use of the prior offers the clearest benefit in very dry catchments, where it moderates strongly negative forecast skill and reduces bias in some instances. However, the prior does not remedy poor reliability in very dry catchments. Overall, FoGSS is an attractive alternative to historical inflow sequences in all but the driest catchments. We discuss ways in which forecast reliability in very dry catchments could be improved in future work.",https://doi.org/10.5194/hess-21-6007-2017,10.5194/hess-21-6007-2017,"Bennett, James C.; Wang, Quan J.; Robertson, David E.; Schepen, Andrew; Li, Ming; Michael, Kelvin",HYDROLOGY AND EARTH SYSTEM SCIENCES,NA,PRECIPITATION; RAINFALL; MODEL; SKILL; CALIBRATION; DROUGHT,NA,COPERNICUS GESELLSCHAFT MBH,GOTTINGEN,"BAHNHOFSALLEE 1E, GOTTINGEN, 37081, GERMANY",1027-5606,1607-7938,NA,HYDROL EARTH SYST SC,Hydrol.

FALSE,618,"Postprocessing continental-scale, medium-range ensemble streamflow forecasts in South America using Ensemble Model Output Statistics and Ensemble Copula Coupling","Probabilistic hydrological forecasting and ensemble techniques have leveraged streamflow prediction at regional to continental scales up to several weeks in advance. However, ensembles that only account for meteorological forecast uncertainty are typically biased and subject to dispersion errors, thus limiting their use for rational decision-making and optimization systems. Statistical postprocessing is therefore necessary to convert ensemble forecasts into calibrated and sharp predictive distributions, and it should also account for dependencies between lead times to enable realistic forecast trajectories. This work provides a continental-scale assessment of the use of statistical postprocessing on medium-range, ensemble streamflow forecasts over South America (SA). These forecasts were produced through a large-scale hydrologic-hydrodynamic model forced with a global precipitation dataset and ECMWF reforecast data. The Ensemble Model Output Statistics (EMOS) technique was used to generate conditional predictive distributions in 488 locations at each forecast lead time, while the Ensemble Copula Coupling method with the transformation scheme (ECC-T) was applied to derive ensemble traces from EMOS distributions. Postprocessed streamflow forecasts were cross-validated for the period from 1996 to 2014 using a range of verification metrics. Results showed that the skill and reliability of EMOS forecasts substantially improve over the raw ensembles, and that EMOS leads to skillful predictions relative to discharge climatology and persistence forecasts up to 15 days in advance in most locations. Furthermore, EMOS results in predictive distributions that are generally sharper than the climatology. Limitations in depicting autocorrelations of forecast trajectories were observed in rivers for which the raw ensemble spread is very low and EMOS has to largely increase dispersion, especially at short lead times. The study's findings suggest that combining a continental-scale hydrological model with EMOS and ECC-T methods can lead to skillful predictions and realistic ensemble traces in several locations in SA, even if in situ hydrometeorological observations are not available in real time.",https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jhydrol.2021.126520,10.1016/j.jhydrol.2021.126520,"Siqueira, Vinicius Alencar; Weerts, Albrecht; Klein, Bastian; Fan, Fernando Mainardi; Dias de Paiva, Rodrigo Cauduro; Collischonn, Walter",JOURNAL OF HYDROLOGY,EMOS; ECC; South America; Ensemble forecasting; Post-processing; Medium-range,PREDICTIVE UNCERTAINTY ASSESSMENT; HYDROLOGICAL ENSEMBLE; PROBABILISTIC FORECASTS; CONDITIONAL PROCESSOR; PRECIPITATION; RUNOFF; RESOLUTION; SYSTEM; BASIN; CALIBRATION,NA,ELSEVIER,AMSTERDAM,"RADARWEG 29, 1043 NX AMSTERDAM, NETHERLANDS",0022-1694,1879-2707,NA,J HYDROL,J.

The model is developed to explore three innovations in hierarchical modeling for seasonal forecasting at ungaged sites: (1) predictive climate teleconnections are inferred directly from ocean fields instead of predefined climate indices, (2) a parsimonious modeling structure is introduced to allow climate teleconnections to vary spatially across streamflow gages, and (3) climate teleconnections and antecedent hydrologic conditions are considered jointly for regional forecast development. The proposed model is developed and calibrated in a hierarchical Bayesian framework to pool regional information across sites and enhance regionalization skill. The model is validated in a cross-validation framework along with five simpler nested formulations to test specific hypotheses embedded in the full model structure. Results indicate that each of the three innovations improve out-of-sample summer low-flow forecasts, with the greatest benefits derived from the spatially heterogeneous effect of climate teleconnections.

In this study, the SWAT model is applied to the Narmada river basin to estimate the surface runoff. The capability of the model is tested for the south west monsoon season (June-September) of 2016 and validated against the NCUM global NWP model forecast data up to Day-5. Two heavy rainfall events are used for verification of the global model forecast with the observed data. The two verification events occurring during 1 July to 15 July (mean of 15 days) and 30 Aug to 11 Sept (mean of 12 days) are considered. Using Arc GIS sub watershed boundaries, the drainage network, slope, land use map and soil map are generated for the whole Narmada river basin. The surface runoff is computed by forcing with observed rainfall data as well as the NCUM model rainfall forecasts data as input to the SWAT model. Model simulations are compared at five stations of Narmada namely-Balkheri, Sandia, Handia, Hoshangabad and Garudeshwar. Initially, the NCUM model rainfall forecast is compared with the actual observation to evaluate the model performances in terms of bias estimation. Then the surface runoff is computed using the observed rainfall data and NCUM forecast data up to Day-5 and made a comparison to evaluate the SWAT model performances. It is shown that the estimated surface runoff during the two active phases is simulated well with some overestimation during the season. The skill of hydrological simulations is examined during different length of forecasts. It is seen that the SWAT model output performance is related to the NWP rainfall forecast skills. NCUM global NWP model is overestimating rainfall amount (wet bias) by 50-70 mm/day over the basin during the two active phases. Further, in all the days' forecasts, the model is showing wet bias over the upper part of the Narmada river basin and a dry bias over the lower part of the basin.

Three main components of the proposed EGEP approach which are capable of producing a parsimonious model include (i) creating a population of suitable solutions using classic genetic programming (GP) instead of a single solution, (ii) combining the solutions throughout gene expression programming, and (iii) parsimony selection based upon trade-off analysis between the complexity and accuracy of the best-evolved solutions at the holdout validation set. The EGEP model was trained and verified using the streamflow measurements from the Shahrchay River lying northwest of Iran. Several statistical indicators were computed for verification of the ensemble models' accuracy with that of classic GP and artificial neural network models developed as the benchmarks.

FALSE,634,Seasonal predictability of water resources in a Mediterranean freshwater reservoir and assessment of its utility for end-users0,"In this study we explore the seasonal predictability of water resources in a Mediterranean environment (the Boadella reservoir, in north-eastern Spain). Its utility for end-users is assessed through the analysis of economic value curve areas (EVA). Firstly, we have built monthly multiple linear regression (MLR) models for the in-flow, out-flow and volume anomalies by identifying the underlying relationships between these predictands and their potential predictors, both meteorological and human influenced: rainfall, maximum and minimum temperatures, reservoir volume and discharge. Subsequently, we have forecast the monthly anomalies with these models for the period 1981-2010 (up to seven months ahead). We have tested the aforementioned models with four strategies in a leave-one-out cross-validation procedure (LOOCV): a) Climatology (Clim.), b) persistence (Pers.), c) antecedent observations + climatology (A + Clim.), d) antecedent observations + European Centre for Medium-range Weather Forecasts (ECMWF) System 4 anomalies (A + S4). Climatology is the operational strategy against which the other approximations are compared. The second and third approaches only use observations as input data. Finally, the last one combines both observations and ECMWF System 4 forecasts. The LOOCV revealed that reservoir volume is the variable best described by the MLR models, followed by in-flow and out-flow anomalies. In the case of volume anomalies, the predictability displayed provides added value with respect to climatology with a minimum of four months in advance. For in-flow and out-flow this is true at one month ahead, and regarding the latter variable we encounter enhanced predictability also at longer horizons for the summer months, when water demands peak (a valuable result for end-users). Hence, there is a window of opportunity to develop future operational frameworks that could outperform the use of climatology for these variables and forecast horizons. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V.

FALSE,635,Evaluating skill and robustness of seasonal meteorological and hydrological drought forecasts at the catchment scale - Case Catalonia (Spain),"Robust sub-seasonal and seasonal drought forecasts are essential for water managers and stakeholders coping with water shortage. Many studies have been conducted to evaluate the performance of hydrological forecasts, that is, streamflow. Nevertheless, only few studies evaluated the performance of hydrological drought forecasts. The objective of this study, therefore, is to analyse the skill and robustness of meteorological and hydrological drought forecasts on a catchment scale (the Ter and Llobregat rivers in Catalonia, Spain), rather than on a continental or global scale. Meteorological droughts were forecasted using downscaled (5 km) probabilistic weather reforecasts (ECMWF-SEAS4). These downscaled data were also used to produce hydrological drought forecasts, derived from time series of streamflow data simulated with a hydrological model (LISFLOOD). This resulted in seasonal hydro-meteorological reforecasts with a lead time up to 7 months, for the time period 2002-2010. These monthly reforecasts were compared to two datasets: (1) droughts derived from a proxy for observed data, including gridded precipitation data and discharge simulated by the LISFLOOD model, fed by these gridded climatological data; and (2) droughts derived from in situ observed precipitation and discharge. Results showed that the skill of hydrological drought forecasts is higher than the climatology, up to 3-4 months lead time. On the contrary, meteorological drought forecasts, analysed using the Standardized Precipitation Index (SPI), do not show added value for short accumulation times (SPI1 and SPI3). The robustness analysis showed that using either a less extreme or a more extreme threshold leads to a large change in forecasting skill, which points at a rather low robustness of the hydrological drought forecasts. Because the skill found in hydrological drought forecasts is higher than the meteorological ones in this case study, the use of hydrological drought forecasts in Catalonia is highly recommended for management of water resources.",https://doi.org/10.1016/j.envint.2019.105206,10.1016/j.envint.2019.105206,"Van Hateren, Theresa C.; Sutanto, Samuel J.; Van Lanen, Henny A.

Hydrological forecasts, which are an essential part of these systems, are used to trigger action against floods around the world. This research presents an evaluation framework, where the skills of the Global Flood Awareness System (GloFAS) are assessed in Peru for the years 2009-2015. Simulated GloFAS discharges are compared against observed ones for 10 river gauges. Forecasts skills are assessed from two perspectives: (i) by calculating verification scores at every river section against simulated discharges and (ii) by comparing the flood signals against reported events.

In this study, an effective data-driven model for surface water quality prediction is developed to analyze the inherent water quality variation tendencies and provide real-time early warnings according to the historical observation data. The developed data-driven model is integrated by an improved genetic algorithm (IGA) for selecting optimal initial weight parameters of neural a network and a back-propagation neural network (BPNN) for adjusting appropriate connection architectures of neural network. First, improved genetic algorithm is used to optimize the reasonable initial weight parameters and prevent the developed model from selecting a local optimal result. Second, BPNN is applied to adjust appropriate connection architectures and identify the features of water quality variation. The developed model is then applied to forecast the surface water quality variations for real-time early warning in Ashi River, China, comparing with simple BPNN model. The prediction results demonstrate that the developed data-driven model can significantly improve the prediction performance both in prediction accuracy and reliability, and effectively provide real-time early warning for emergency response.",https://doi.org/10.1007/s11356-019-06049-2,10.1007/s11356-019-06049-2,"Jin, Tao; Cai, Shaobin; Jiang, Dexun; Liu, Jie",ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE AND POLLUTION RESEARCH,Surface water quality; Water quality prediction; Early warning; Improved genetic algorithm; Back-propagation neural network,ARTIFICIAL NEURAL-NETWORK; RIVER-BASIN; SYSTEM; RESERVOIR; RISK,NA,SPRINGER HEIDELBERG,HEIDELBERG,"TIERGARTENSTRASSE 17, D-69121 HEIDELBERG, GERMANY",0944-1344,1614-7499,NA,ENVIRON SCI POLLUT R,Environ.

Short-term weather forecasts and antecedent hydrological variables were inputs to a three-layered hydrologically-relevant Artificial Neural Network (ANN) to forecast inflow for 7-days of lead-time. Application of the scheme was demonstrated over 23 dams in U.S. with varying hydrological characteristics and climate regimes. Probabilistic forecast was also explored by feeding ANN with ensembles of weather forecast fields. Results suggest forecasting skill improves with decreasing coefficient of variation in inflow and increasing drainage area. Forecast-informed operations were simulated using a rolling horizon scheme and assessed against benchmark control rules.

FALSE,645,Ensemble Streamflow Forecasting Using an Energy Balance Snowmelt Model Coupled to a Distributed Hydrologic Model with Assimilation of Snow and Streamflow Observations,"In many river basins across the world, snowmelt is an important source of streamflow. However, detailed snowmelt modeling is hampered by limited input data and uncertainty arising from inadequate model structure and parametrization. Data assimilation that updates model states based on observations, reduces uncertainty and improves streamflow forecasts. In this study, we evaluated the Utah Energy Balance (UEB) snowmelt model coupled to the Sacramento Soil Moisture Accounting (SAC-SMA) and rutpix7 stream routing models, integrated within the Research Distributed Hydrologic Model (RDHM) framework for streamflow forecasting. We implemented an ensemble Kalman filter for assimilation of snow water equivalent (SWE) observations in UEB and a particle filter for assimilation of streamflow to update the SAC-SMA and rutpix7 states. Using leave one out validation, it was shown that the modeled SWE at a location where observations were excluded from data assimilation was improved through assimilation of data from other stations, suggesting that assimilation of sparse observations of SWE has the potential to improve the distributed modeling of SWE over watershed grid cells. In addition, the spatially distributed snow data assimilation improved streamflow forecasts and the forecast volume error was reduced. On the other hand, the assimilation of streamflow observations did not provide additional forecast improvement over that achieved by the SWE assimilation for seasonal forecast volume likely due to there being little information content in streamflow at the forecast date prior to its rising during the melt period and this application of particle filter being better suited for shorter timescales.",https://doi.org/10.1029/2019WR025472,10.1029/2019WR025472,"Gichamo, Tseganeh Z.; Tarboton, David G.",WATER RESOURCES RESEARCH,ensemble streamflow forecast; Utah Energy Balance (UEB) snowmelt model; Research Distributed Hydrologic Model (RDHM); data assimilation; ensemble Kalman filter (EnKF); particle filter (PF),SURFACE-TEMPERATURE; TURBULENT FLUXES; KALMAN FILTER; SOIL-MOISTURE; INFORMATION; PRECIPITATION; FREQUENCY; STATES,NA,AMER GEOPHYSICAL UNION,WASHINGTON,"2000 FLORIDA AVE NW, WASHINGTON, DC 20009 USA",0043-1397,1944-7973,NA,WATER RESOUR RES,Water Resour.

FALSE,646,THE BENEFIT OF USING AN ENSEMBLE OF SEASONAL STREAMFLOW FORECASTS,"The area to be cropped in irrigation districts needs to be planned according to the allocated water, which in turn is a function of the available water resource. However, conservative estimates of the available resource in rivers and reservoirs may lead to unnecessary curtailments in allocated water due to conservative estimates of future (in) flows. Water allocations may be revised as the season progresses, though inconsistency in allocation is undesirable to farmers as they may then not be able to use that water, thus leading to an opportunity cost in agricultural production. In this study we assess the benefit of using reservoir inflow estimates derived from seasonal forecast datasets to improve water allocation decisions. A feedback loop between simulated reservoir storage and emulated water allocations to General Security (water allocated to irrigating) was developed to evaluate two seasonal reservoir inflow forecast datasets (POAMA and ESP), derived from the Forecast Guided Stochastic Scenarios (FoGSS), a 12 month seasonal ensemble forecast in Australia. We evaluate the approach in the Murrumbidgee basin, comparing water allocations obtained with an expected reservoir inflow from FoGSS against the allocations obtained with an expected reservoir inflow from a conservative estimate based on climatology (as currently used by the basin authority), as well as against those obtained using observed inflows (perfect information). The inconsistency in allocated water is evaluated by determining the total changes in allocated water made every 15 days from the initial allocation at the start of the water year to the end of the irrigation season, including both downward and upward revisions of allocations. Results show that the inconsistency due to upward revisions in allocated water is lower when using the forecast datasets (POAMA and ESP) compared to the conservative inflow estimates (reference) which is beneficial to the planning of cropping areas by farmers. Over confidence can, however, lead to an increase in undesirable downward revisions. This is more evident for dry years than for wet years. Even though biases are found in inflow predictions, the accuracy of the available water estimates using the forecast ensemble improves progressively during the water year, especially one and a half months before the start of the cropping season in November, providing additional time for farmers to make key decision on planting.",https://doi.org/,NA,"Kaune Schmidt, Alexander Jose","VALUE OF USING HYDROLOGICAL DATASETS FOR WATER ALLOCATION DECISIONS: EARTH OBSERVATIONS, HYDROLOGICAL MODELS AND SEASONAL FORECASTS",NA,NA,NA,CRC PRESS-BALKEMA,LEIDEN,"PO BOX 11320, LEIDEN,  South Holland, NETHERLANDS",NA,NA,978-94-6395-008-4; 978-0-367-42955-3,NA,NA,NA,2019,NA,NA,83,113,NA,NA

This study developed a flood routing model combined with a particle filter-based assimilation model and a one-dimensional hydrodynamic model. This model was applied to an indoor micro-model, using the Lower Yellow River (LYR) as prototype. Real-time observations of the water level from the micro-model were used for data assimilation. The results show that, compared to the traditional hydrodynamic model, the assimilation model could effectively update water level, flow discharge, and roughness coefficient in real time, thus yielding improved results. The mean water levels of the particle posterior distribution are closer to the observed values than before assimilation, even when water levels change greatly. In addition, the calculation results for different lead times indicate that the root mean square error of the forecasting water level gradually increases with increasing lead time. This is because the roughness value changes greatly in response to unsteady water flow, and the incurring error accumulates with the predicted period. The results show that the assimilation model can simulate water level changes in the micro-model and provide both research method and technical support for real flood forecasting in the LYR.",https://doi.org/10.3390/w10111612,10.3390/w10111612,"Chen, Minghong; Pang, Juanjuan; Wu, Pengxiang",WATER,flood forecasting; data assimilation; particle filter algorithm; micro-model; Lower Yellow River,SEQUENTIAL DATA ASSIMILATION; TUTORIAL,NA,MDPI,BASEL,"ST ALBAN-ANLAGE 66, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND",2073-4441,NA,NA,WATER-SUI,Water,NOV,2018,10,11,NA,NA,1612,NA

In 2011, the mountainous region of Rio de Janeiro state suffered one of the largest natural hazards in Brazil, affecting more than 300,000 people, leaving more than 900 dead. This article simulates this natural hazard through Quantitative Precipitation Forecasting (QPF) and streamflow forecast ensemble, using 18 combinations of parameterizations between cumulus, microphysics, surface layer, planetary boundary layer, land surface and lateral contour conditions of the Weather Research and Forecasting (WRF) Model, coupling to the Soil Moisture Accounting Procedure (SMAP) hydrological model, seeking to find the best set of parametrizations for the forecasting of extreme events in the region. The results showed rainfall and streamflow forecast were underestimated by the models, reaching an error of 57.4% to QPF and 24.6% error to streamflow, and part of these errors are related to the lack of skill of the atmospheric model in predicting the intensity and the spatial-temporal distribution of rainfall.

Here some possible model structures are investigated using a range of stochastic regression and transfer function techniques with additional insights gained from simple analytical approximations. The methods were evaluated using records for two of the largest lakes in the world Lake Malawi and Lake Victoria - with forecast skill demonstrated several months ahead using water balance models formulated in terms of net inflows.

Statistical streamflow post-processing is an important technique available to improve the probabilistic properties of the forecasts. This study evaluates post-processing approaches based on three transformations - logarithmic (Log), log-sinh (Log-Sinh), and Box-Cox with lambda = 0.2 (BC0.2) - and identifies the best-performing scheme for post-processing monthly and seasonal (3-months-ahead) streamflow forecasts, such as those produced by the Australian Bureau of Meteorology. Using the Bureau's operational dynamic streamflow forecasting system, we carry out comprehensive analysis of the three post-processing schemes across 300 Australian catchments with a wide range of hydro-climatic conditions. Forecast verification is assessed using reliability and sharpness metrics, as well as the Continuous Ranked Probability Skill Score (CRPSS). Results show that the uncorrected forecasts (i. e. without post-processing) are unreliable at half of the catchments. Post-processing of forecasts substantially improves reliability, with more than 90% of forecasts classified as reliable. In terms of sharpness, the BC0.2 scheme substantially outperforms the Log and Log-Sinh schemes. Overall, the BC0.2 scheme achieves reliable and sharper-than-climatology forecasts at a larger number of catchments than the Log and Log-Sinh schemes.

The US Department of Agriculture Natural Resources Conservation Service (NRCS) operates the largest such system regionally. NRCS recently developed a next-generation WSF prototype, the multi-model machine-learning metasystem (M-4). Here, we test this ensemble artificial intelligence (AI)-based prototype against challenging theoretical and practical criteria for accepting a new operational WSF model. In 20 hindcasting test-cases spanning diverse environments across the western US and Alaska, on average out-of-sample R-2 and RPSS improved over 50% and RMSE improved 13% relative to current benchmarks. The M-4 ensemble mean forecast also performed more consistently than any of its diverse constituent models and in several cases outperformed all of them. Live operational testing at a subset of sites during the 2020 forecast season additionally demonstrated logistical feasibility of workflows, as well as geophysical explainability of results in terms of known hydrologic processes, belying the black-box reputation of machine learning and enabling relatable forecast storylines for clients. This was accomplished using WSF-focused pragmatic solutions, like popular votes for different candidate predictors among the constituent forecast systems, and graphical visualization of reduced-dimension, AI-extracted nonlinear feature-target relationships. We also found that certain M-4 technical design elements, including autonomous machine learning (AutoML), hyperparameter pre-calibration, and theory-guided data science, collectively permitted automated (over-the-loop) training and operation. Overall, the analyses confirmed M-4 meets requirements for NRCS operational adoption. This finding signals that, despite negligible operational-community uptake of machine learning so far, suitably purpose-designed novel AI systems have capacity to transition into large-scale practical applications with service-delivery organizations; it appears M-4 will be the largest AI migration into operational river forecasting to date.

Two distinct ensemble prediction systems accounting for (i) perturbed initial and lateral boundary conditions of the meteorological state and (ii) mesoscale model physical parameterizations have been implemented on the Agly catchment of the eastern Pyrenees with three subcatchments exhibiting different rainfall regimes. Different evaluations of the performance of the hydrometeorological strategies have been performed: (i) verification of short-range ensemble prediction systems and corresponding streamflow forecasts, for a better understanding of how forecasts behave; (ii) usual measures derived from a contingency table approach, to test an alert threshold exceedance; and (iii) overall evaluation of the hydrometeorological chain using the continuous rank probability score, for a general quantification of the ensemble performances. Results show that the overall discharge forecast is improved by both ensemble strategies with respect to the deterministic forecast.

Therefore, the flow forecasts for these plants subsidize the decision making within the scope of the Electric Sector, since they allow the evaluation of the operational conditions of the hydroelectric and thermoelectric plants through the use of energy optimization models, providing gains in the operations of SIN (Sistema Interligado Nacional - the Brazilian National Interconnected System). The precipitation forecast is of fundamental importance for the elaboration of these hydroelectric flow forecasts. For energy evaluations, the DECOMP and NEWAVE models are used, with the GEVAZP model being applied to generate scenarios through an AR (p) (autoregressive) model. Accordingly, this study shows the impact of precipitation forecast on flow predictions in the climate horizon. For this, a statistical correction was made in the rain predicted by the CFS (Climate Forecast System) model, which tends to overestimate the predicted rain, with rainfall-flow models being calibrated. Tests were performed with this new modeling system and the results, in the form of scenarios, were compared with the scenarios generated by the GEVAZP model, showing the possibility of reducing the generated range by the latter, consequently causing the DECOMP model to not consider ranges with little or no probability of occurrence, which can improve the optimization of the SIN operation planning. This work also shows that the SMAP model exhibited better performance when compared to the Neural Networks model, in terms of the average flow range predicted in relation to the observed flow. There was a clear improvement in the flow predictions with the incorporation of the rain observed one month ahead in the simulations, mainly in the forecast of high flows.

To attain a complete evaluation of the ensemble-model based results, the global mean of six quantitative statistical performance evaluation measures: the coefficient of correlation (R), mean absolute relative error (MAE), root mean squared error (RMSE), Nash-Sutcliffe efficiency coefficient (NS), relative RMSE, and the Willmott's Index (WI), and Taylor diagrams, including skill scores relative to a persistence model, were selected to assess the performances of the developed predictive models. The results indicated that all of the averaged R value attained was higher than 0.900 and all of the averaged NS values were higher than 0.800, representing good performance of the SVR, MARS and M5Tree models applied in the 1-, 2- and 3-day ahead modeling horizon, and this also accorded with the deductions made through an assessment of the Willmott's Index. However, the M5Tree model outperformed both the SVR and MARS models (with NS = 0.917 vs. 0.904 and 0.901 for 1-day, 0.893 vs. 0.854 and 0.845 for 2-day, and 0.850 vs. 0.828 and 0.810 for 3-day forecasting horizons, respectively), which was in concurrence with the high value of WI. Therefore, based on the ensemble of 50 models, the performance of the M5Tree can be considered as superior to the SVR and MARS models when applied in a problem of river flow forecasting at multiple forecast horizon. A detailed comparison of the overall performance of all three models evaluated through Taylor diagrams and boxplots indicated that the 1-day ahead forecasting results were more accurate for all of the predictive models compared to the 2- and 3-day ahead forecasting horizons. Data-intelligent models designed in this study indicate that the M5Tree method could successfully be explored for short-term river flow forecasting in semiarid mountainous regions, which may have useful implications in water resources management, ecological sustainability and assessment of river systems.",https://doi.org/10.1007/s00477-018-1585-2,10.1007/s00477-018-1585-2,"Yin, Zhenliang; Feng, Qi; Wen, Xiaohu; Deo, Ravinesh C.; Yang, Linshan; Si, Jianhua; He, Zhibin",STOCHASTIC ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH AND RISK ASSESSMENT,River flow forecasting; Support vector regression; Multivariate adaptive regression spline; M5Tree model; Data-driven model,SUPPORT VECTOR MACHINE; ADAPTIVE REGRESSION SPLINES; ARTIFICIAL NEURAL-NETWORK; RAINFALL-RUNOFF PROCESS; GLOBAL SOLAR-RADIATION; FUZZY INFERENCE SYSTEM; ABSOLUTE ERROR MAE; PAN EVAPORATION; REFERENCE EVAPOTRANSPIRATION; FREQUENCY-ANALYSIS,NA,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"ONE NEW YORK PLAZA, SUITE 4600, NEW YORK, NY, UNITED STATES",1436-3240,1436-3259,NA,STOCH ENV RES RISK A,Stoch.

FALSE,695,A Composite Uncertainty Forecasting Model for Unstable Time Series: Application of Wind Speed and Streamflow Forecasting,"Wind speed and streamflow series always are nonlinear and unstable because the effects of chaotic weather systems. These inherent features make them difficult to forecast, especially in a changing environment. To improve forecasting accuracy, an innovation uncertainty forecasting architecture is developed by coupling data decomposition method, feature selection, multiple artificial intelligence (AI) techniques and composite strategy to do unstable time series forecasting. In the designed architecture, the AVMD (adaptive variational mode decomposition) is first applied to excavate implicit information from the original time series. Then, the random forest is utilized to select the suitable inputs for each mode. After that, the GPR (Gaussian Process Regression), a very famous probabilistic AI technique, is driven by various neural networks (ELM (Extreme Learning Machine), BP (Back Propagation Neural Networks), GRNN(Generalized Regression Neural Networks) and RBF (Radial Basis Function Neural Networks)) to produce both deterministic and probabilistic forecasting results in a nonlinear manner to play strengths of each other. The effectiveness and applicability of the proposed approach is verified by unstable wind speed data and streamflow data, and also compared with eleven related models. Results indicate that the proposed model not only improves the forecasting accuracy for deterministic predictions, but also provides more probabilistic information for decision making. The proposed method achieves significantly better performance than the traditional forecasting models both on wind speed forecasting and streamflow forecasting with at least 50% average performance promotion over all the eleven competitors. Comprehensive comparisons demonstrate the superior performance of the proposed method than the involved models as a powerful tool for unstable series forecasting.",https://doi.org/10.1109/ACCESS.2020.3034127,10.1109/ACCESS.2020.3034127,"Sun, Na; Zhang, Shuai; Peng, Tian; Zhou, Jianzhong; Sun, Xinguo",IEEE ACCESS,Forecasting; Predictive models; Wind speed; Data models; Computational modeling; Uncertainty; Unstable time series prediction; hybrid model; GPR; artificial intelligence; combination forecasting,NEURAL-NETWORK; SECONDARY DECOMPOSITION; PREDICTION INTERVAL; HYBRID MODEL; MACHINE; OPTIMIZATION; MULTISTEP,NA,IEEE-INST ELECTRICAL ELECTRONICS ENGINEERS INC,PISCATAWAY,"445 HOES LANE, PISCATAWAY, NJ 08855-4141 USA",2169-3536,NA,NA,IEEE ACCESS,IEEE Access,NA,2020,8,NA,209251,209266,NA,NA
FALSE,700,Seasonal forecasting of hydrological drought in the Limpopo Basin: a comparison of statistical methods,"The Limpopo Basin in southern Africa is prone to droughts which affect the livelihood of millions of people in South Africa, Botswana, Zimbabwe and Mozambique. Seasonal drought early warning is thus vital for the whole region. In this study, the predictability of hydrological droughts during the main runoff period from December to May is assessed using statistical approaches. Three methods (multiple linear models, artificial neural networks, random forest regression trees) are compared in terms of their ability to forecast streamflow with up to 12 months of lead time. The following four main findings result from the study. 1. There are stations in the basin at which standardised streamflow is predictable with lead times up to 12 months. The results show high inter-station differences of forecast skill but reach a coefficient of determination as high as 0.73 (cross validated). 2. A large range of potential predictors is considered in this study, comprising well-established climate indices, customised teleconnection indices derived from sea surface temperatures and antecedent streamflow as a proxy of catchment conditions. El Nino and customised indices, representing sea surface temperature in the Atlantic and Indian oceans, prove to be important teleconnection predictors for the region. Antecedent streamflow is a strong predictor in small catchments (with median 42% explained variance), whereas teleconnections exert a stronger influence in large catchments. 3. Multiple linear models show the best forecast skill in this study and the greatest robustness compared to artificial neural networks and random forest regression trees, despite their capabilities to represent nonlinear relationships. 4. Employed in early warning, the models can be used to forecast a specific drought level. Even if the coefficient of determination is low, the forecast models have a skill better than a climatological forecast, which is shown by analysis of receiver operating characteristics (ROCs). Seasonal statistical forecasts in the Limpopo show promising results, and thus it is recommended to employ them as complementary to existing forecasts in order to strengthen preparedness for droughts.",https://doi.org/10.5194/hess-21-1611-2017,10.5194/hess-21-1611-2017,"Seibert, Mathias; Merz, Bruno; Apel, Heiko",HYDROLOGY AND EARTH SYSTEM SCIENCES,NA,SOUTHERN AFRICA; NEURAL-NETWORK; RIVER-BASIN; PREDICTABILITY; VARIABILITY; PREDICTION; RAINFALL; CLIMATE; PRECIPITATION; PERFORMANCE,NA,COPERNICUS GESELLSCHAFT MBH,GOTTINGEN,"BAHNHOFSALLEE 1E, GOTTINGEN, 37081, GERMANY",1027-5606,1607-7938,NA,HYDROL EARTH SYST SC,Hydrol.

FALSE,705,The application of ensemble precipitation forecasts to reservoir operation,"Although inflow forecasts are useful information that can be used for improving reservoir operation efficiency, uncertainty is still a challenge for getting sound operation results. Ensemble precipitation forecasts can take uncertainties under consideration, so they have been a research topic for improving reservoir operations. In this paper, a rainfall-runoff model, combined of a multiple linear regression model (for non-flood seasons) and the Xinanjiang model (for flood seasons), for inflow forecasts and a stochastic dynamic programming model for reservoir operations are developed in order to effectively use the ensemble precipitation forecast. To explore the best way for using the ensemble precipitation forecast, two post-processing techniques, i.e., ensemble forecast averaging (EFA) and interval value (IV), are tested. The ensemble precipitation forecast from the European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts (ECMWF) was chosen due to its high accuracy, and the Huanren reservoir, located in China, was used to test the newly developed models. The results show that, compared with the traditional rule curve, hydropower generation increases by 4.86% and 4.55%, respectively, when EFA and IV are used, which indicates that the use of ensemble forecasts facilitates considerable improvements in operating performance.",https://doi.org/10.2166/ws.2018.105,10.2166/ws.2018.105,"Peng, Anbang; Zhang, Xiaoli; Peng, Yong; Xu, Wei; You, Fangfang",WATER SUPPLY,ensemble precipitation forecasts; inflow forecast; reservoir operation; stochastic dynamic programming model,XINANJIANG MODEL,NA,IWA PUBLISHING,LONDON,"ALLIANCE HOUSE, 12 CAXTON ST, LONDON SW1H0QS, ENGLAND",1606-9749,1607-0798,NA,WATER SUPPLY,Water Supply,MAR,2019,19,2,588,595,NA,NA
FALSE,710,Inter-comparison between retrospective ensemble streamflow forecasts using meteorological inputs from ECMWF and NOAA/ESRL in the Hudson River sub-basins during Hurricane Irene (2011),"The objective of this work was to evaluate the benefits of using multi-model meteorological ensembles in representing the uncertainty of hydrologic forecasts. An inter-comparison experiment was performed using meteorological inputs from different models corresponding to Hurricane Irene (2011), over three sub-basins of the Hudson River basin. The ensemble-based precipitation inputs were used as forcing in a hydrological model to retrospectively forecast hourly streamflow, with a 96-hour lead time. The inputs consisted of 73 ensemble members, namely one high-resolution ECMWF deterministic member, 51 ECMWF members and 21 NOAA/ESRL (GEFS Reforecasts v2) members. The precipitation inputs were resampled to a common grid using the bilinear resampling method that was selected upon analysing different resampling methods. The results show the advantages of forcing hydrologic forecasting systems with multi-model ensemble forecasts over using deterministic and single model ensemble forecasts. The work showed that using the median of all 73 ensemble streamflow forecasts relatively improved the Nash-Sutcliffe Efficiency and lowered the biases across the examined sub-basins, compared with using the ensemble median from an individual model. This research contributes to the growing literature that demonstrates the promising capabilities of multi-model systems to better describe the uncertainty in streamflow predictions.",https://doi.org/10.2166/nh.2018.182,10.2166/nh.2018.182,"Saleh, F.; Ramaswamy, V; Georgas, N.; Blumberg, A.
