1,Forecasting the combined effects of anticipated climate change and agricultural conservation practices on fish recruitment dynamics in Lake Erie,"Many aquatic ecosystems are experiencing multiple anthropogenic stressors that threaten their ability to support ecologically and economically important fish species. Two of the most ubiquitous stressors are climate change and non-point source nutrient pollution. Agricultural conservation practices (ACPs, i.e. farming practices that reduce runoff, prevent erosion, and curb excessive nutrient loading) offer a potential means to mitigate the negative effects of non-point source pollution on fish populations. However, our understanding of how ACP implementation amidst a changing climate will affect fish production in large ecosystems that receive substantial upstream sediment and nutrient inputs remains incomplete. Towards this end, we explored how anticipated climate change and the implementation of realistic ACPs might alter the recruitment dynamics of three fish populations (native walleye Sander vitreus and yellow perch Perca flavescens and invasive white perch Morone americana) in the highly productive, dynamic west basin of Lake Erie. We projected future (2020-2065) recruitment under different combinations of anticipated climate change (n = 2 levels) and ACP implementation (n = 4 levels) in the western Lake Erie catchment using predictive biological models driven by forecasted winter severity, spring warming rate, and Maumee River total phosphorus loads that were generated from linked climate, catchment-hydrology, and agricultural-practice-simulation models. In general, our models projected reduced walleye and yellow perch recruitment whereas invasive white perch recruitment was projected to remain stable or increase relative to the recent past. Our modelling also suggests the potential for trade-offs, as ACP implementation was projected to reduce yellow perch recruitment with anticipated climate change. Overall, our study presents a useful modelling framework to forecast fish recruitment in Lake Erie and elsewhere, as well as offering projections and new avenues of research that could help resource management agencies and policy-makers develop adaptive and resilient management strategies in the face of anticipated climate and land-management change.",https://doi.org/10.1111/fwb.13515,10.1111/fwb.13515,"Dippold, David A.; Aloysius, Noel R.; Keitzer, Steven Conor; Yen, Haw; Arnold, Jeffrey G.; Daggupati, Prasad; Fraker, Michael E.; Martin, Jay F.; Robertson, Dale M.; Sowa, Scott P.; Johnson, Mari-Vaughn V.; White, Mike J.; Ludsin, Stuart A.",FRESHWATER BIOLOGY,climate warming; eutrophication; fisheries management; multiple stressors; percid,STIZOSTEDION-VITREUM-VITREUM; LAURENTIAN GREAT-LAKES; PERCH PERCA-FLAVESCENS; FRESH-WATER FISHES; EASTERN BERING-SEA; YELLOW PERCH; WHITE PERCH; RE-EUTROPHICATION; MORONE-AMERICANA; ENVIRONMENTAL-FACTORS,,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0046-5070,1365-2427,,FRESHWATER BIOL,Freshw.

2,Projecting the effects of agricultural conservation practices on stream fish communities in a changing climate,"How anticipated climate change might affect long-term outcomes of present-day agricultural conservation practices remains a key uncertainty that could benefit water quality and biodiversity conservation planning. To explore this issue, we forecasted how the stream fish communities in the Western Lake Erie Basin (WLEB) would respond to increasing amounts of agricultural conservation practice (ACP) implementation under two IPCC future greenhouse gas emission scenarios (RCP4.5: moderate reductions; RCP8.5: business-as-usual conditions) during 2020-2065. We used output from 19 General Circulation Models to drive linked agricultural land use (APEX), watershed hydrology (SWAT), and stream fish distribution (boosted regression tree) models, subsequently analyzing how projected changes in habitat would influence fish community composition and functional trait diversity. Our models predicted both positive and negative effects of climate change and ACP implementation on WLEB stream fishes. For most species, climate and ACPs influenced species in the same direction, with climate effects outweighing those of ACP implementation. Functional trait analysis helped clarify the varied responses among species, indicating that more extreme climate change would reduce available habitat for large-bodied, cool-water species with equilibrium life-histories, many of which also are of importance to recreational fishing (e.g., northern pike, smallmouth bass). By contrast, available habitat forwarm-water, benthic species with more periodic or opportunistic life-histories (e.g., northern hogsucker, greater redhorse, greenside darter) was predicted to increase. Further, ACP implementation was projected to hasten these shifts, suggesting that efforts to improve water quality could come with costs to other ecosystem services (e.g., recreational fishing opportunities). Collectively, our findings demonstrate the need to consider biological outcomes when developing strategies to mitigate water quality impairment and highlight the value of physical-biological modeling approaches to agricultural and biological conservation planning in a changing climate.

3,"HMETS-A Simple and Efficient Hydrology Model for Teaching Hydrological Modelling, Flow Forecasting and Climate Change Impacts","Hydrological models are commonly used to forecast streamflow and for climate change impact studies. There is a wide range of hydrology models using lumped conceptual approaches all the way to more physically based distributed algorithms. Most of these models come with a steep learning curve before they can be used efficiently by the end user, and they can be tricky to calibrate appropriately. Only a small number of hydrology models can be considered easy to set up and use, and even fewer provide their source code for easy modification to be tailored to individual needs. These drawbacks make it difficult to use these models in educational applications. The goal of this paper is to introduce a very simple, yet efficient, lumped-conceptual hydrological model designed to address the above problems. The MATLAB-based HMETS hydrological model is simple and can be easily and quickly set up on a new watershed, including automatic calibration using state of the art optimization algorithms. Despite its simplicity, the model has proved to perform well against two other lumped-conceptual hydrological models over 320 watersheds. HMETS obtained a median Nash-Sutcliffe Efficiency of 0.72 in validation, compared to 0.64 for MOHYSE (similar structure) and 0.77 for HSAMI (more complex structure). The model's source code is freely available and includes an optional simplified user interface. A climate change impacts simulation tool using the constant scaling downscaling method is also incorporated to the interface. HMETS has been tested in the Construction Engineering Final-Year Project for a group of 60 undergraduate students.",https://doi.org/,,"Martel, Jean-Luc; Demeester, Kenjy; Brissette, Francois; Poulin, Annie; Arsenault, Richard",INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ENGINEERING EDUCATION,teaching hydrological modelling; rainfall-runoff model; lumped model; conceptual model; climate change impact studies,UNCERTAINTY; OPTIMIZATION; EQUIFINALITY,,TEMPUS PUBLICATIONS,"DURRUS, BANTRY","IJEE , ROSSMORE,, DURRUS, BANTRY, COUNTY CORK 00000, IRELAND",0949-149X,,,INT J ENG EDUC,Int.

4,Comparing models using air and water temperature to forecast an aquatic invasive species response to climate change,"Understanding invasive species spread and projecting how distributions will respond to climate change is a central task for ecologists. Typically, current and projected air temperatures are used to forecast future distributions of invasive species based on climate matching in an ecological niche modeling approach. While this approach was originally developed for terrestrial species, it has also been widely applied to aquatic species even though aquatic species do not experience air temperatures directly. In the case of lakes, species respond to lake thermal regimes, which reflect the interaction of climate and lake attributes such as depth, size, and clarity. The result is that adjacent waterbodies can differ notably in thermal regime. Given these obvious limitations of modeling aquatic species distributions using climate data, we take advantage of recent advances in simulating lake thermal regimes to model the distributions of invasive spiny water flea (Bythotrephes cederstromii) for current and projected future climates in the upper Midwest of the USA. We compared predictions and future projections from models based on modeled air temperatures with models based on modeled water temperature. All models predicted that the number of suitable lakes in the region will decrease with climate change. Models based on air and water temperature differed dramatically in the extent of this decrease. The air temperature model predicted 89% of study lakes to be suitable, with suitability declining dramatically in the late century with climate warming to just a single suitable lake. Lake suitability predictions from the water temperature model declined to a much lesser degree with warming (42% of lakes were predicted to be suitable, declining to 19% in the late century) and were more spatially independent. Our results expose the limitations of using air temperatures to model habitat suitability for aquatic species, and our study further highlights the importance of understanding lake-specific responses to climate when assessing aquatic species responses to climate change. While we project a contraction in the potential range ofBythotrepheswith warming in the study region, we anticipate thatBythotrepheswill likely continue to expand into new lakes that will remain suitable in the following decades.",https://doi.org/10.1002/ecs2.3137,10.1002/ecs2.3137,"Walsh, Jake R.; Hansen, Gretchen J.

5,A Forecasting and Prediction Methodology for Improving the Blue Economy Resilience to Climate Change in the Romanian Lower Danube Euroregion,"European Union (EU) policy encourages the development of a blue economy (BE) by unlocking the full economic potential of oceans, seas, lakes, rivers and other water resources, especially in member countries in which it represents a low contribution to the national economy (under 1%). However, climate change represents a main barrier to fully realizing a BE. Enabling conditions that will support the sustainable development of a BE and increase its climate resiliency must be promoted. Romania has high potential to contribute to the development of the EU BE due to its geographic characteristics, namely the presence of the Danube Delta-Black Sea macrosystem, which is part of the Romanian Lower Danube Euroregion (RLDE). Aquatic living resources represent a sector which can significantly contribute to the growth of the BE in the RLDE, a situation which imposes restrictions for both halting biodiversity loss and maintaining the proper conditions to maximize the benefits of the existing macrosystem. It is known that climate change causes water quality problems, accentuates water level fluctuations and loss of biodiversity and induces the destruction of habitats, which eventually leads to fish stock depletion. This paper aims to develop an analytical framework based on multiple linear predictive and forecast models that offers cost-efficient tools for the monitoring and control of water quality, fish stock dynamics and biodiversity in order to strengthen the resilience and adaptive capacity of the BE of the RLDE in the context of climate change. The following water-dependent variables were considered: total nitrogen (TN); total phosphorus (TP); dissolved oxygen (DO); pH; water temperature (wt); and water level, all of which were measured based on a series of 26 physicochemical indicators associated with 4 sampling areas within the RLDE (Braila, Galati, Tulcea and Sulina counties). Predictive models based on fish species catches associated with the Galati County Danube River Basin segment and the Danube Delta Biosphere Reserve Administration territory were included in the analytical framework to establish an efficient tool for monitoring fish stock dynamics and structures as well as identify methods of controlling fish biodiversity in the RLDE to enhance the sustainable development and resilience of the already-existing BE and its expansion (blue growth) in the context of aquatic environment climate variation. The study area reflects the integrated approach of the emerging BE, focused on the ocean, seas, lakes and rivers according to the United Nations Agenda. The results emphasized the vulnerability of the RLDE to climate change, a situation revealed by the water level, air temperature and water quality parameter trend lines and forecast models. Considering the sampling design applied within the RLDE, it can be stated that the Tulcea county Danube sector was less affected by climate change compared with the Galati county sector as confirmed by water TN and TP forecast analysis, which revealed higher increasing trends in Galati compared with Tulcea. The fish stock biodiversity was proven to be affected by global warming within the RLDE, since peaceful species had a higher upward trend compared with predatory species. Water level and air temperature forecasting analysis proved to be an important tool for climate change monitoring in the study area. The resulting analytical framework confirmed that time series methods could be used together with machine learning prediction methods to highlight their synergetic abilities for monitoring and predicting the impact of climate change on the marine living resources of the BE sector within the RLDE. The forecasting models developed in the present study were meant to be used as methods of revealing future information, making it possible for decision makers to adopt proper management solutions to prevent or limit the negative impacts of climate change on the BE. Through the identified independent variables, prediction models offer a solution for managing the dependent variables and the possibility of performing less cost-demanding aquatic environment monitoring activities.",https://doi.org/10.3390/su132111563,10.3390/su132111563,"Petrea, Stefan Mihai; Zamfir, Cristina; Simionov, Ira Adeline; Mogodan, Alina; Nuta, Florian Marcel; Rahoveanu, Adrian Turek; Nancu, Dumitru; Cristea, Dragos Sebastian; Buhociu, Florin Marian",SUSTAINABILITY,blue economy; fish stocks; water quality; machine learning; forecast models,ARTIFICIAL NEURAL-NETWORKS; WATER-QUALITY INDEX; DISSOLVED-OXYGEN; CHANGE IMPACTS; FISH; RIVER; GROWTH; FISHERIES; LEVEL; NORTH,,MDPI,BASEL,"ST ALBAN-ANLAGE 66, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND",,2071-1050,,SUSTAINABILITY-BASEL,Sustainability,NOV,2021,13,21,,,11563,
6,A meta-modeling approach for hydrological forecasting under uncertainty: Application to groundwater nitrate response to climate change,"We suggest a quantitative predictive approach based on meta-modeling techniques for long-term forecasting in hydrology. We apply our scalable methodological framework to a representative groundwater body in EmiliaRomagna region of Italy to evaluate the potential impact of climate change on groundwater nitrate concentration. The approach allows to (i) handle the uncertainty associated with the projection of climate variables, (ii) preserve an accurate description of flow and transport processes, and (iii) drastically accelerate computationally intensive simulations, at a time. A long-term climate scenario (i.e. referred to the 30-years 2061-2090) is developed for the study area by considering changes in the natural recharge to groundwater, the baseflow of the main rivers, and the rate of nitrate leaching. Global sensitivity analysis is performed to assess the relative influence of these factors on the quantity of interest (QoI), i.e. the long-term prediction of groundwater nitrate concentration. Our analysis enables also us to compute the spatial statistics and variability of the moments of the QoI over the study area and to perform Monte Carlo simulations to fully characterize the probabilistic behavior of the QoI at selected sensitive locations.",https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jhydrol.2021.127173,10.1016/j.jhydrol.2021.127173,"Focaccia, S.; Panini, G.; Pedrazzoli, P.; Ciriello, V",JOURNAL OF HYDROLOGY,Meta-modeling; Polynomial chaos expansion; Nitrate contamination; Climate change; Groundwater,GLOBAL SENSITIVITY-ANALYSIS; POLYNOMIAL CHAOS; FRAMEWORK; IMPACTS,,ELSEVIER,AMSTERDAM,"RADARWEG 29, 1043 NX AMSTERDAM, NETHERLANDS",0022-1694,1879-2707,,J HYDROL,J.

7,A multi-scenario ensemble streamflow forecast method for Amu Darya River Basin under considering climate and land-use changes,"Land-use and climate changes have impacts on hydrological processes for river basin. In this study, a multi-scenario ensemble streamflow forecast (MESF) method is developed for analyzing the streamflow variation under considering climate and land-use changes, through incorporating CA-Markov model, global climate model (GCM) and Soil and Water Assessment Tool (SWAT) model within a general framework. The advantages of MESF are as follows: (i) it can simultaneously assess the impacts of land-use and climate changes on streamflow; (ii) it can obtain the possible trend and the range of future streamflows through ensemble forecast under multiple scenarios; (iii) based on analysis of streamflow processes under extreme scenarios, it can examine the effects of key factors on streamflow. The MESF method is applied to the upper reaches of the Amu Darya River Basin in Central Asia. Totally 72 scenarios, under different land-use patterns, GCMs and Representative Concentration Pathways (RCPs), are analyzed. Ensemble forecast results reveal that (i) during 2021-2050, the average annual precipitation and the average annual temperature would both increase, but the mean annual streamflow would decrease; (ii) compared to the impact of land-use change, climate change has more obvious effects on the streamflow (with contribution of 78.8%-98.7%); (iii) among all factors of land-use change, glacier melting triggered by climate warming is the most prominent factor; (iv) the peak flow in one year would have a tendency to shift from summer to spring due to the rising temperature and the speeding up snow melt.",https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jhydrol.2021.126276,10.1016/j.jhydrol.2021.126276,"Xu, Z.

8,Forecasting water temperature in lakes and reservoirs using seasonal climate prediction,"Seasonal climate forecasts produce probabilistic predictions of meteorological variables for subsequent months. This provides a potential resource to predict the influence of seasonal climate anomalies on surface water balance in catchments and hydro-thermodynamics in related water bodies (e.g., lakes or reservoirs). Obtaining seasonal forecasts for impact variables (e.g., discharge and water temperature) requires a link between seasonal climate forecasts and impact models simulating hydrology and lake hydrodynamics and thermal regimes. However, this link remains challenging for stakeholders and the water scientific community, mainly due to the probabilistic nature of these predictions. In this paper, we introduce a feasible, robust, and open-source workflow integrating seasonal climate forecasts with hydrologic and lake models to generate seasonal forecasts of discharge and water temperature profiles. The workflow has been designed to be applicable to any catchment and associated lake or reservoir, and is optimized in this study for four catchment-lake systems to help in their proactive management. We assessed the performance of the resulting seasonal forecasts of discharge and water temperature by comparing them with hydrologic and lake (pseudo)observations (reanalysis). Precisely, we analysed the historical performance using a data sample of past forecasts and reanalysis to obtain information about the skill (performance or quality) of the seasonal forecast system to predict particular events. We used the current seasonal climate forecast system (SEAS5) and reanalysis (ERA5) of the European Centre for Medium Range Weather Forecasts (ECMWF). We found that due to the limited predictability at seasonal time-scales over the locations of the four case studies (Europe and South of Australia), seasonal forecasts exhibited none to low performance (skill) for the atmospheric variables considered. Nevertheless, seasonal forecasts for discharge present some skill in all but one case study. Moreover, seasonal forecasts for water temperature had higher performance in natural lakes than in reservoirs, which means human water control is a relevant factor affecting predictability, and the performance increases with water depth in all four case studies. Further investigation into the skillful water temperature predictions should aim to identify the extent to which performance is a consequence of thermal inertia (i.e., lead-in conditions).

9,SWATCH21: A project for linking eco-hydrologic processes and services to aquatic biodiversity at river and catchment levels,"The objective of the SWATCH21 project is to improve our understanding of eco-hydrologic services at the catchment level, and biodiversity at the river scale. Six research questions are proposed: (i) How can we improve the access to input data for hydrological and ecological modeling? (ii) What is the role of glacier and snow in modifying the hydrological services? (iii) How can we best assess hydrologic services supplies and demands with the available data and tools? (iv) What will be the impact of the main hydrologic changes on species diversity in rivers? (v) Can we meet the targets of multi-sectorial river-related policies under different climate and landuse forecasting scenarios? (vi) How detailed do ES data and models need to be to answer relevant policy questions? The above questions are tackled through an integrated framework to access, share, process, model, and deliberate on hydrologic ecosystems services. State-of-the-art models have been selected, and will be compared and improved to model different ecosystems and their services. Initial results from a first SWAT model of Switzerland and Species Distribution Models are presented. Expected outputs from various climate and land use change scenarios include rivers' hydrology, predicted biodiversity, and the assessment of ecosystem services in terms of provisioning services (e.g. water resources), regulating services (e.g. nutrient, sediment and flood water retention), and cultural services (e.g. biodiversity, recreation). The expected outcome of the project is to improve integrated evidence-based water policy in the future through the analysis of tradeoffs and synergies between services.

10,Enhancing Ensemble Seasonal Streamflow Forecasts in the Upper Colorado River Basin Using Multi-Model Climate Forecasts,"In the Colorado River Basin (CRB), ensemble streamflow prediction (ESP) forecasts drive operational planning models that project future reservoir system conditions. CRB operational seasonal streamflow forecasts are produced using ESP, which represents climate using an ensemble of meteorological sequences of historical temperature and precipitation, but do not typically leverage additional real-time subseasonal-to-seasonal climate forecasts. Any improvements to streamflow forecasts would help stakeholders who depend on operational projections for decision making. We explore incorporating climate forecasts into ESP through variations on an ESP trace weighting approach, focusing on Colorado River unregulated inflows forecasts to Lake Powell. The k-nearest neighbors (kNN) technique is employed using North American Multi-Model Ensemble one- and three-month temperature and precipitation forecasts, and preceding three-month historical streamflow, as weighting factors. The benefit of disaggregated climate forecast information is assessed through the comparison of two kNN weighting strategies; a basin-wide kNN uses the same ESP weights over the entire basin, and a disaggregated-basin kNN applies ESP weights separately to four subbasins. We find in general that climate-informed forecasts add greater marginal skill in late winter and early spring, and that more spatially granular disaggregated-basin use of climate forecasts slightly improves skill over the basin-wide method at most lead times.",https://doi.org/10.1111/1752-1688.12960,10.1111/1752-1688.12960,"Baker, Sarah A.; Rajagopalan, Balaji; Wood, Andrew W.",JOURNAL OF THE AMERICAN WATER RESOURCES ASSOCIATION,streamflow forecasts; trace weighting; subseasonal-to-seasonal; climate forecasts; Colorado River; NMME; reservoir inflows,PREDICTION; SKILL; COLUMBIA; MODEL; SCORE; ENSO,,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",1093-474X,1752-1688,,J AM WATER RESOUR AS,J.

11,"Forecasting low flow conditions months in advance through teleconnection patterns, with a special focus on summer 2018","Over the past decades, Europe has been affected by several low flow periods which had substantial impacts on the hydrology of the rivers themselves as well as on the society and economy. Low flow periods have a direct impact on the environment, on the inland waterway navigation, on the hydropower production as well as on the sediment management, among others. Similar to floods, low flows are naturally occurring phenomena which can significantly hinder different uses and functions of the rivers and impact the aquatic system and the water quality. Moreover, it is projected that, in the future, climate change might lead to drier summers over the European region and therefore to more frequent and severe low flow periods. The results presented here show that the summer 2018 low flow situation, over the Rhine and Elbe Rivers basin, could have been predicted up to two seasons ahead by using previous months' sea surface temperature, sea level pressure, precipitation, mean air temperature and soil moisture. The lagged relationship between the predictand (e.g. seasonal streamflow) and the climate and oceanic predictors varies between 1 month (e.g. precipitation) up to 6 months (e.g. sea surface temperature). Taking into account that all predictors are available in real-time, the forecast scheme can be used to provide early warnings for the upcoming low flow situations, thus offering the possibility for better management of the water resources.",https://doi.org/10.1038/s41598-020-70060-8,10.1038/s41598-020-70060-8,"Ionita, M.; Nagavciuc, V",SCIENTIFIC REPORTS,,NORTH-ATLANTIC OSCILLATION; VARIABILITY; STREAMFLOW; DROUGHT; TEMPERATURE; CLIMATE,,NATURE RESEARCH,BERLIN,"HEIDELBERGER PLATZ 3, BERLIN, 14197, GERMANY",2045-2322,,,SCI REP-UK,Sci Rep,AUG 6,2020,10,1,,,13258,
12,Variation in the predictability of lake plankton metric types,"Statistical and climate models are frequently used for biodiversity projections under future climatic changes, but their predictive capacity for freshwater plankton may vary among different species and community metrics. Here, we used random forests to model plankton species and community metrics as a function of biological, climatic, physical, and chemical data from long-term (2000-2017) monitoring data collected from Lake Muggelsee Berlin, Germany. We (1) compared the predictability of well-known lake plankton metric types (biomass, abundance, taxonomic diversity, Shannon diversity, Simpson diversity, evenness, taxonomic distinctness, and taxonomic richness) and (2) assessed how the relative influence of different environmental drivers varies across lake plankton metric models. Overall, the metric predictability was highest for biomass and abundance followed by taxonomic richness. The biomass of dominant phytoplankton taxonomic groups such as cyanobacteria (adjusted-R-2 = 0.53) and the abundance of dominant zooplankton taxonomic groups such as rotifers (adjusted-R-2 = 0.59) and daphnids (adjusted-R-2 = 0.51) were more predictable than other metric types. The plankton metric predictability increased when grouping phytoplankton species according to their functional traits (adjusted-R-2 = 0.37 +/- 0.14, mean +/- SD, n = 36 functional groups) compared to higher taxonomic units (adjusted-R-2 = 0.25 +/- 0.15, n = 22 taxonomic groups). Light, nutrients, water temperature, and seasonality for phytoplankton and food resources for zooplankton were the main drivers of both taxonomic and functional groups, giving confidence that our models captured the expected major environmental drivers. Our quantitative analyses highlight the multidimensionality of lake planktonic responses to environmental drivers and have implications for our capacity to select appropriate metrics for forecasting the future of lake ecosystems under global change scenarios.",https://doi.org/10.1002/lno.12021,10.1002/lno.12021,"Kakouei, Karan; Kraemer, Benjamin M.; Adrian, Rita",LIMNOLOGY AND OCEANOGRAPHY,,TAXONOMIC DISTINCTNESS; ENVIRONMENTAL GRADIENTS; CYANOBACTERIA DOMINANCE; ANTHROPOGENIC IMPACTS; DIVERSITY INDEXES; TRAIT COMPOSITION; POLYMICTIC LAKE; PHYTOPLANKTON; BIODIVERSITY; CONSEQUENCES,,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0024-3590,1939-5590,,LIMNOL OCEANOGR,Limnol.

13,Ensemble Based Forecasting and Optimization Framework to Optimize Releases from Water Supply Reservoirs for Flood Control,"Water supply reservoir management is based on long-term management policies which depend on customer demands and seasonal hydrologic changes. However, increasing frequency and intensity of precipitation events is necessitating the short-term management of such reservoirs to reduce downstream flooding. Operational management of reservoirs at hourly/daily timescales is challenging due to the uncertainty associated with the inflow forecasts and the volumes in the reservoir. We present an ensemble-based streamflow prediction and optimization framework consisting of a regional scale hydrologic model forced with ensemble precipitation inputs to obtain probabilistic inflows to the reservoir. A multi-objective dynamic programming model was used to obtain optimized release strategies accounting for the inflow uncertainties. The proposed framework was evaluated at a water supply reservoir in the Hackensack River basin in New Jersey during Hurricanes Irene and Sandy. Hurricane Irene resulted in the overtopping of the dam despite releases made in anticipation of the event and resulted in severe downstream flooding. Hurricane Sandy was characterized by low rainfall, however, raised significant concerns of flooding given the nature of the event. The improvement in NSE for the Hurricane Irene inflows from 0.5 to 0.76 and reduction of the spread of PBIAS with decreasing lead times resulted in improvements in the forecast informed releases.

14,"Forecasting of Future Flooding and Risk Assessment under CMIP6 Climate Projection in Neuse River, North Carolina","Hydrological extremes associated with climate change are becoming an increasing concern all over the world. Frequent flooding, one of the extremes, needs to be analyzed while considering climate change to mitigate flood risk. This study forecast streamflow and evaluate risk of flooding in the Neuse River, North Carolina considering future climatic scenarios, and comparing them with an existing Federal Emergency Management Agency study. The cumulative distribution function transformation method was adopted for bias correction to reduce the uncertainty present in the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project Phase 6 (CMIP6) streamflow data. To calculate 100-year and 500-year flood discharges, the Generalized Extreme Value (L-Moment) was utilized on bias-corrected multimodel ensemble data with different climate projections. Out of all projections, shared socio-economic pathways (SSP5-8.5) exhibited the maximum design streamflow, which was routed through a hydraulic model, the Hydrological Engineering Center's River Analysis System (HEC-RAS), to generate flood inundation and risk maps. The result indicates an increase in flood inundation extent compared to the existing study, depicting a higher flood hazard and risk in the future. This study highlights the importance of forecasting future flood risk and utilizing the projected climate data to obtain essential information to determine effective strategic plans for future floodplain management.",https://doi.org/10.3390/forecast2030018,10.3390/forecast2030018,"Pokhrel, Indira; Kalra, Ajay; Rahaman, Md Mafuzur; Thakali, Ranjeet",FORECASTING,streamflow; CMIP6; bias correction; HEC-RAS; flood inundation maps; risk assessment,FREQUENCY-ANALYSIS; GLOBAL PROJECTIONS; L-MOMENT; HEC-RAS; MODEL; IMPACT; MANAGEMENT; RESOLUTION; EXTREMES; HAZARD,,MDPI,BASEL,"ST ALBAN-ANLAGE 66, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND",,2571-9394,,FORECASTING-BASEL,Forecasting,SEP,2020,2,3,323,345,,
15,"Operationalizing a flood forecasting decision support system for Ayeyarwady river, Myanmar","Myanmar is one of the developing countries of South East Asia (SEA), wherein millions of people are exposed to risk of flooding every year. The Department of Meteorology and Hydrology (DMH), Myanmar is thus, bestowed with the responsibility of flood forecasting within the country for early warning. This study presents a new web-based Decision Support System (DSS), for DMH's use in operational flood forecasting. The new DSS, that has a forecast lead time of 24-72 h, is a significant improvement over the existing forecasting systems used by DMH, which had a lead time of 4-24 h. Moreover, the new DSS couples Hydrological Engineering Centre Hydrological Modelling System (HEC-HMS) with Weather and Research (WRF) rainfall forecast for Ayeyarwady river basin (ARB), the principle river basin of the country. In addition to the hydro-meteorological coupling, core modules of the DSS include rainfall forecasting, bias correction and flow error correction. The hydrological model setup of the DSS was calibrated and validated for the periods 2008-2012 and 2013-2014 with observed rainfall. The DSS was then actively deployed and tested operationally by DMH using bias-corrected WRF rainfall forecasts for the period 2015-2017. Performance of the system is very good in forecasting flows and floods within ARB, and also provides additional lead time to DMH for issuing the flood advisories. Hence, the novel web-based flood forecasting DSS, is an important applied research contribution, that is being successfully used by the operational staff of DMH for short-term flood forecasting in Myanmar and has the potential to improve flood resiliency of similar agencies in the SEA region.",https://doi.org/10.1080/15715124.2020.1738445,10.1080/15715124.2020.1738445,"Agarwal, Anshul; Ghimire, Uttam; Than, Htay Htay; Srinivasan, Govindarajalu; Dash, Itesh; Shakya, Niraj; Oo, Myo Tun",INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF RIVER BASIN MANAGEMENT,Flood forecasting system; Decision Support system; Weather Research and forecasting; HEC-HMS; Ayeyarwady river basin; Myanmar,HEC-HMS; BIAS CORRECTION; COUPLING WRF; RAINFALL; BASIN; PREDICTION; WEATHER; MODEL; SCALE; TIME,,TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD,ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OR14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1571-5124,1814-2060,,INT J RIVER BASIN MA,Int.

16,Algal bloom prediction by support vector machine and relevance vector machine with genetic algorithm optimization in freshwater reservoirs,"Purpose - The purpose of this paper is to examine the applicability and capability of models based on a genetic algorithm and support vector machine (GA-SVM) and a genetic algorithm and relevance vector machine (GA-RVM) for the prediction of phytoplankton abundances associated with algal blooms in a Macau freshwater reservoir, and compare their performances with an artificial neural network (ANN) model. Design/methodology/approach - The hybrid models GA-SVM and GA-RVM were developed for the optimal control of parameters for predicting (based on the current month's variables) and forecasting (based on the previous three months' variables) phytoplankton dynamics in a Macau freshwater reservoir, MSR, which has experienced cyanobacterial blooms in recent years. There were 15 environmental parameters, including pH, SiO2, alkalinity, bicarbonate (HCO3-), dissolved oxygen (DO), total nitrogen (TN), UV254, turbidity, conductivity, nitrate (NO3-), orthophosphate (PO43-), total phosphorus (TP), suspended solids (SS) and total organic carbon (TOC) selected from the correlation analysis, with eight years (2001-2008) of data for training, and the most recent three years (2009-2011) for testing. Findings - For both accuracy performance and generalized performance, the ANN, GA-SVM and GA-RVM had similar predictive powers of R-2 of 0.73-0.75. However, whereas ANN and GA-RVM models showed very similar forecast performances, GA-SVM models had better forecast performances of R-2 (0.862), RMSE (0.266) and MAE (0.0710) with the respective parameters of 0.987, 0.161 and 0.032 optimized using GA. Originality/value - This is the first application of GA-SVM and GA-RVM models for predicting and forecasting algal bloom in freshwater reservoirs. GA-SVM was shown to be an effective new way for monitoring algal bloom problem in water resources.",https://doi.org/10.1108/EC-11-2015-0356,10.1108/EC-11-2015-0356,"Wang, Yanjie; Xie, Zhengchao; Lou, InChio; Ung, Wai Kin; Mok, Kai Meng",ENGINEERING COMPUTATIONS,Algal bloom; GA-RVM; GA-SVM; Phytoplankton abundance; Prediction and forecast models,COMPRESSIVE STRENGTH; CLASSIFICATION,,EMERALD GROUP PUBLISHING LTD,BINGLEY,"HOWARD HOUSE, WAGON LANE, BINGLEY BD16 1WA, W YORKSHIRE, ENGLAND",0264-4401,1758-7077,,ENG COMPUTATION,Eng.

17,Predicting Lake Quality for the Next Generation: Impacts of Catchment Management and Climatic Factors in a Probabilistic Model Framework,"Lake ecosystems across the world are under combined pressures of eutrophication and climate change, which increase the risk of harmful cyanobacteria blooms, reduced ecological status, and degraded ecosystem services. In Europe, the third cycle of river basin management plans (2021-2027) according to the Water Framework Directive must take into account the potential impacts of climate change on water quality, including effects on relevant biological indicators. Here, we applied a Bayesian network as a meta-model for linking future climate and land-use scenarios for the time horizon 2050-2070, via process-based catchment and lake models, to cyanobacteria abundance and ecological status of a eutrophic lake. Building upon previous applications of the model, a new version was developed to include relevant climatic variables such as wind speed. Explorative scenarios showed that the combination of low wind and high temperature gave the most synergistic effects on cyanobacteria under high levels of eutrophication (Chl-a concentration). Considering the management target of good ecological status, however, the climate-related promotion of cyanobacteria blooms contributed most to degrading the ecological status at intermediate levels of eutrophication. Future developments of this model will aim to strengthen the link between climate variables and ecological responses, to make the model also useful for seasonal forecasting.",https://doi.org/10.3390/w11091767,10.3390/w11091767,"Moe, S.

18,FORECAST OF THE MAXIMUM FLOW MARMARIK RIVER AND REACTIONS OF THE GLOBAL CLIMATE CHANGE (ARMENIA),"The paper discusses and analyzes the peculiarities of formation of maximum flow rates of the Marmarik River, analyzes and evaluates the patterns of multi-year fluctuations of maximum flow rates in different river sites in the context of global climate change, made a comparative analysis, gave a forecast of the maximum flow rate for the lower river course. Actual observational data of Armhydromet for maximum flow rate, air temperature and precipitation were used as the source material. The available literature sources were processed and analyzed, the mathematical-statistical, geographical, and also methods of comparison and analysis were applied. To determine the maximum flow rates of the Marmarik River, the Ankavan post and the Gomur River, the Meghradzor post, the winter period precipitation, the sum of positive temperatures, liquid precipitation, the volume of the runoff of the flood period were used, but no reliable dependencies were obtained. Dependencies obtained can be used for consultations. To determine the maximum flow at the Aghavnadzor post of the Marmarik River, a multifactorial correlation close relationship was obtained, which can be used to compile operational forecasts of the maximum flow in this river site. The absolute values of the maximum river flow of the Marmarik River at Aghavnadzor are estimated for different scenarios of climate change. For different scenarios and cases in the Marmarik River basin, a different degree of changes in the maximum flow might be expected. Moreover, the largest decrease in the maximum runoff of the Marmarik River basin is expected under the conditions of an increase in the average air temperature of the spring season by 2.7-3.9 and a decrease in the amount of spring atmospheric precipitation by 2.4-2.6%. As a result of the study, it turned out that in the study area there is only a tendency to decrease the values of maximum water discharge which is the result of both human activities and climate change.",https://doi.org/10.17223/25421379/13/4,10.17223/25421379/13/4,"Margaryan, V.

19,Prediction of Yangtze River streamflow based on deep learning neural network with El Nino-Southern Oscillation,"Accurate long-term streamflow and flood forecasting have always been an important research direction in hydrology research. Nowadays, climate change, floods, and other anomalies occurring more and more frequently and bringing great losses to society. The prediction of streamflow, especially flood prediction, is important for disaster prevention. Current hydrological models based on physical mechanisms can give accurate predictions of streamflow, but the effective prediction period is only about 1 month in advance, which is too short for decision making. The artificial neural network (ANN) has great potential for predicting runoff and is not only good at handling non-linear data but can also make long-period forecasts. However, most of ANN models are unstable in their predictions when faced with raw flow data, and have excessive errors in predicting extreme flows. Previous studies have shown a link between the El Nino-Southern Oscillation (ENSO) and the streamflow of the Yangtze River. In this paper, we use ENSO and the monthly streamflow data of the Yangtze River from 1952 to 2018 to predict the monthly streamflow of the Yangtze River in two extreme flood years and a small flood year by using deep neural networks. In this paper, three deep neural network frameworks are used: stacked long short-term memory, Conv long short-term memory encoder-decoder long short-term memory and Conv long short-term memory encoder-decoder gate recurrent unit. The results show that the use of ConvLSTM improves the stability of the model and increases the accuracy of the flood prediction. Besides, the introduction of ENSO to the experimental data resulted in a more accurate prediction of the time of the occurrence of flood peaks and flood flows. Furthermore, the best results were obtained on the convolutional long short-term memory+encoder-decoder gate recurrent unit model.",https://doi.org/10.1038/s41598-021-90964-3,10.1038/s41598-021-90964-3,"Ha, Si; Liu, Darong; Mu, Lin",SCIENTIFIC REPORTS,,MONTHLY INFLOW; ENSO; MODELS; PRECIPITATION; VARIABILITY; INDEX,,NATURE RESEARCH,BERLIN,"HEIDELBERGER PLATZ 3, BERLIN, 14197, GERMANY",2045-2322,,,SCI REP-UK,Sci Rep,JUN 3,2021,11,1,,,11738,
20,A potential threat to amphibians in the European Natura 2000 network: Forecasting the distribution of the American bullfrog Lithobates catesbeianus,"Freshwater biodiversity is declining at an accelerated pace. Climate change and associated global warming and changes in precipitation patterns, combined with the expansion of generalist -invasive species are two of the main threats. Niche-based models (NBMs) are becoming inevitable tools in invasive species risk assessment and in conservation decision-making. Lithobates catesbeianus is an invasive species globally known for its adverse ecological impacts on native amphibians and biodiversity. To assess species current and future climatic suitable areas at the global and European scales we used an ensemble forecasting approach. We considered six climatic variables, three timeframes (current, 2050, and 2070), and two CO2 emission scenarios. Temperature seasonality, minimum temperature of the coldest month, maximum temperature of the warmest month, and precipitation in the driest month were the most important variables predicting bullfrog occurrence. Globally currently 3.8% of land area is suitable for bullfrog and an increase of up to 5.2% in 2070 is expected. Increase in suitable areas is expected at higher latitudes, especially in North America and central Europe. Currently, 3.45% of total Natura 2000 area is suitable, and a predicted range gain of up to 355.93% (12.28%) is expected in the highest concentration scenarios predictions. This can indicate that the 64 native amphibian species present in the Natura 2000 network could be at increased risk. The choice of Natura 2000 for a geographic detailed analysis of the possible effects on native amphibians is due to its importance for habitats and wildlife conservation. Identification of its invasion-susceptible areas will allow resource and management practices optimization.",https://doi.org/10.1016/j.biocon.2020.108551,10.1016/j.biocon.2020.108551,"Johovic, Iva; Gama, Mafalda; Banha, Filipe; Tricarico, Elena; Anastacio, Pedro Manuel",BIOLOGICAL CONSERVATION,American bullfrog; Invasive species; Habitat suitability; Natura2000,SPECIES DISTRIBUTION MODELS; CLIMATE-CHANGE; COMMUNITY STRUCTURE; RANA-CATESBEIANA; CONSERVATION; HABITAT; TEMPERATURE; POPULATIONS; EXTINCTIONS; BIODIVERSITY,,ELSEVIER SCI LTD,OXFORD,"THE BOULEVARD, LANGFORD LANE, KIDLINGTON, OXFORD OX5 1GB, OXON, ENGLAND",0006-3207,1873-2917,,BIOL CONSERV,Biol.

21,"Short-term forecasting of cyanobacteria blooms in Yuqiao reservoir, China","Agriculture fertilizers and untreated sewage in the catchment of freshwater bodies increase their nutrient concentrations. The resulting eutrophication promotes phytoplankton blooms, in many cases of toxic cyanobacteria. Ecological models can simulate the main processes driving algal blooms. They help to understand how phytoplankton responds to different forcing. Another major use of models is as predictive tool supporting the management of water resources. Yuqiao Reservoir is the main drinking water source for Tianjin, the fifth most populated city in China. During the last decade, drinking water production has been impaired by recurrent cyanobacteria blooms. The water quality management of the reservoir, conducted by the Hai River Water Conservancy Commission, requires an early warning system in order to anticipate the cyanobacteria blooms and to adapt the treatment process. Therefore, within the framework of a French-Chinese project on Integrated Water Resources Management (IWRM) of the catchment of the Hai river, a modelling approach of cyanobacteria growth, which could be later embedded in an early warning system, was proposed. In this study, we calibrated a one-dimensional vertical, physical-ecological model aimed at forecasting cyanobacteria blooms in the Yuqiao Reservoir. We first introduce the study site and its ecological status. Then we describe the model and the input data set. The calibration and validation results are presented for water temperature and chlorophyll-a concentration at the measurement dates. The short-term forecast modelling is performed for temperature and cyanobacteria over a 5-day ahead period.

22,A Methodology for Forecasting Dissolved Oxygen in Urban Streams,"Real-time monitoring of river water quality is at the forefront of a proactive urban water management strategy to meet the global challenge of vital freshwater resource sustainability. The concentration of dissolved oxygen (DO) is a primary indicator of the health state of the aquatic habitats, and its modeling is crucial for river water quality management. This paper investigates the importance of the choices of different techniques for preprocessing and stochastic modeling for developing a simple and reliable linear stochastic model for forecasting DO in urban rivers. We describe several methods of evaluation, preprocessing, and modeling for the DO parameter time series in the Credit River, Ontario, Canada, to achieve the optimum data preprocessing and input selection techniques and consequently obtain the optimum performance of the stochastic models as an effective river management tool. The Manly normalization and standardization (S-td) methods were chosen for preprocessing the time series. Modeling the preprocessed time series using the stochastic autoregressive integrated moving average (ARIMA) model resulted in very accurate forecasts with a negligible difference from sole normalization and spectral analysis (S-f) methods.",https://doi.org/10.3390/w12092568,10.3390/w12092568,"Stajkowski, Stephen; Zeynoddin, Mohammad; Farghaly, Hani; Gharabaghi, Bahram; Bonakdari, Hossein",WATER,water resources; stochastic; preprocessing; dissolved oxygen; water quality,HYBRID NEURAL-NETWORK; WATER-QUALITY; MODEL; RIVER; TEMPERATURE; PERFORMANCE; PREDICTION; MACHINE; LAKE,,MDPI,BASEL,"ST ALBAN-ANLAGE 66, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND",,2073-4441,,WATER-SUI,Water,SEP,2020,12,9,,,2568,
23,"Inflow Forecast of Iranamadu Reservoir, Sri Lanka, under Projected Climate Scenarios Using Artificial Neural Networks","Prediction of water resources for future years takes much attention from the water resources planners and relevant authorities. However, traditional computational models like hydrologic models need many data about the catchment itself. Sometimes these important data on catchments are not available due to many reasons. Therefore, artificial neural networks (ANNs) are useful soft computing tools in predicting real-world scenarios, such as forecasting future water availability from a catchment, in the absence of intensive data, which are required for modeling practices in the context of hydrology. These ANNs are capable of building relationships to nonlinear real-world problems using available data and then to use that built relationship to forecast future needs. Even though Sri Lanka has an extensive usage of water resources for many activities, including drinking water supply, irrigation, hydropower development, navigation, and many other recreational purposes, forecasting studies for water resources are not being carried out. Therefore, there is a significant gap in forecasting water availability and water needs in the context of Sri Lanka. Thus, this paper presents an artificial neural network model to forecast the inflows of one of the most important reservoirs in northern Sri Lanka using the upstream catchment's rainfall. Future rainfall data are extracted using regional climate models for the years 2021-2050 and the inflows of the reservoir are forecasted using the validated neural network model. Several training algorithms including Levenberg-Marquardt (LM), BFGS quasi-Newton (BFG), scaled conjugate gradient (SCG) have been used to find the best fitting training algorithm to the prediction process of the inflows against the measured inflows. Results revealed that the LM training algorithm outperforms the other tests algorithm in developing the prediction model. In addition, the forecasted results using the projected climate scenarios clearly showcase the benefit of using the forecasting model in solving future water resource management to avoid or to minimize future water scarcity. Therefore, the validated model can effectively be used for proper planning of the proposed drinking water supply scheme to the nearby urban city, Jaffna in northern Sri Lanka.",https://doi.org/10.1155/2020/8821627,10.1155/2020/8821627,"Karunanayake, Chamaka; Gunathilake, Miyuru B.; Rathnayake, Upaka",APPLIED COMPUTATIONAL INTELLIGENCE AND SOFT COMPUTING,,RAINFALL-RUNOFF MODEL; WATER-BUDGET; WAVELET; SIMULATION; PREDICTION; IMPACT; ANN; VARIABILITY; ALGORITHM; CONFLICTS,,HINDAWI LTD,LONDON,"ADAM HOUSE, 3RD FLR, 1 FITZROY SQ, LONDON, W1T 5HF, ENGLAND",1687-9724,1687-9732,,APPL COMPUT INTELL S,Appl.

24,PREDICTION OF CHANGE IN HYDROLOGIC CYCLE COMPONENTS IN NORTH KOREA RIVER BASINS: THE RCP8.5 CLIMATE CHANGE SCENARIO,"North Korea is particularly vulnerable to natural disasters related to climate change, such as flooding and drought, as its forest ecosystem has been damaged as a result of excess development due to food and energy shortage. To prepare for potential natural disasters and to come up with effective countermeasures against climate change, it is crucial to make use of systematic and scientific weather and climate forecasting information in the best possible way. However, it is difficult to find hydrologic data for North Korea, and direct observations of the nation's hydrology are practically impossible to make. Therefore, because of the difficulties in collecting hydrological data, studies on climate change and hydrology in North Korea are rarely conducted. This study collected precipitation and temperature data from 27 weather stations located in North Korea (provided by the World Meteorological Organization), and used the RCP8.5 climate change scenario of the Korean Meteorological Administration to calculate potential future evapotranspiration for each station. The study applied a lumped conceptual model (Water And Snow Balance MODeling system (WASMOD)) to North Korea's representative river basins (Daedong River, Aprok River) to obtain a supplementary hydrologic data time series through doing calculations based on the calculated time series data of the future hydrologic cycle components of North Korea. The study analyzed the impact of climate change on the hydrologic cycle process of North Korea using the RCP8.5 climate change scenario, and predicted its influence on water resources at a river basin scale.",https://doi.org/10.2495/WRM170251,10.2495/WRM170251,"Jeung, Se Jin; Kwon, Bo Ra; Kim, Byung Sik",WATER RESOURCES MANAGEMENT IX,RCP8.5 climate change scenario; North Korea; hydrological cycle components; time series analysis,,,WIT PRESS,SOUTHAMPTON,"ASHURST LODGE, SOUTHAMPTON SO40 7AA, ASHURST, ENGLAND",1743-3541,,978-1-78466-206-6; 978-1-78466-205-9,WIT TRANS ECOL ENVIR,WIT Trans.

25,Benchmarking Real-Time Streamflow Forecast Skill in the Himalayan Region,"Improving decision-making in various areas of water policy and management (e.g., flood and drought preparedness, reservoir operation and hydropower generation) requires skillful streamflow forecasts. Despite the recent advances in hydrometeorological prediction, real-time streamflow forecasting over the Himalayas remains a critical issue and challenge, especially with complex basin physiography, shifting weather patterns and sparse and biased in-situ hydrometeorological monitoring data. In this study, we demonstrate the utility of low-complexity data-driven persistence-based approaches for skillful streamflow forecasting in the Himalayan country Nepal. The selected approaches are: (1) simple persistence, (2) streamflow climatology and (3) anomaly persistence. We generated the streamflow forecasts for 65 stream gauge stations across Nepal for short-to-medium range forecast lead times (1 to 12 days). The selected gauge stations were monitored by the Department of Hydrology and Meteorology (DHM) Nepal, and they represent a wide range of basin size, from similar to 17 to similar to 54,100 km(2). We find that the performance of persistence-based forecasting approaches depends highly upon the lead time, flow threshold, basin size and flow regime. Overall, the persistence-based forecast results demonstrate higher forecast skill in snow-fed rivers over intermittent ones, moderate flows over extreme ones and larger basins over smaller ones. The streamflow forecast skill obtained in this study can serve as a benchmark (reference) for the evaluation of many operational forecasting systems over the Himalayas.",https://doi.org/10.3390/forecast2030013,10.3390/forecast2030013,"Ghimire, Ganesh R.; Sharma, Sanjib; Panthi, Jeeban; Talchabhadel, Rocky; Parajuli, Binod; Dahal, Piyush; Baniya, Rupesh",FORECASTING,Himalayan region; streamflow forecast verification; persistence; snow-fed rivers; intermittent rivers,EXCESS RAINFALL PROPERTIES; SCALING STRUCTURE; PEAK-DISCHARGES; VARIABILITY; IMPACT,,MDPI,BASEL,"ST ALBAN-ANLAGE 66, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND",,2571-9394,,FORECASTING-BASEL,Forecasting,SEP,2020,2,3,230,247,,
26,Simulating Climate Change Impacts on Surface Water Resources Within a Lake-Affected Region Using Regional Climate Projections,"This study aims to assess the impact of climate change on water resources in a large watershed within the Laurentian Great Lakes region, using the fully integrated surface-subsurface model HydroGeoSphere. The hydrologic model is forced with an ensemble of high-resolution climate projections from the Weather Research and Forecasting (WRF) model. The latter has been extended with an interactive lake model (FLake) to capture the effect of the Great Lakes on the regional climate. The WRF ensemble encompasses two different moist physics configurations at resolutions of 90, 30, and 10km, as well as four different initial and boundary conditions, so as to control for natural climate variability. The integrated hydrologic model is run with a representative seasonal cycle, which effectively controls natural climate variability, while remaining computationally tractable with a large integrated model. However, the range of natural variability is also investigated, as are the impacts of climate model resolution and bias correction. The two WRF configurations show opposite climate change responses in summer precipitation, but similar responses otherwise. The hydrologic simulations generally follow the climate forcing; however, due to the memory of the subsurface, the differences in summer propagate throughout the entire seasonal cycle. This results in a set of dry scenarios with reduced streamflow and water availability year-round and a set of wet scenarios with increased streamflow for all times excluding the spring peak, which does not increase. Most of the analysis focuses on streamflow, but changes in the seasonal cycle of baseflow and groundwater recharge are also analyzed. Plain Language Summary In this study we investigate the impact of climate change on water resources using state-of-the-art computer simulations. The simulations were conducted using physically based models, which simulate the circulation of the atmosphere, rainfall, and the flow of water above and below the surface. The region of interest here is the Grand River Watershed, located in the Great Lakes region (southern Ontario, Canada). We show that with high resolution and a physical representation of the Great Lakes, only a simple correctionmuch less than for global climate modelsis necessary, in order to simulate a realistic climate. We find that predicted climate change impacts on water resources depend strongly on some approximations commonly made to represent thunderstorms and precipitation in climate models. The most likely scenario, based on our analysis, is an increase in precipitation and streamflow in all seasons except spring, but some scenarios also show less precipitation in summer, which results in lower streamflow year-round. A major result is that differences in summer precipitation can affect streamflow in all seasons, but only if the interaction with groundwater is properly accounted for. At the moment uncertainty in future summer precipitation changes limits our ability to predict impacts on water resources.",https://doi.org/10.1029/2018WR024381,10.1029/2018WR024381,"Erler, Andre R.; Frey, Steven K.; Khader, Omar; d'Orgeville, Marc; Park, Young-Jin; Hwang, Hyoun-Tae; Lapen, David R.; Peltier, W.

27,Stochastic Decadal Projections of Colorado River Streamflow and Reservoir Pool Elevations Conditioned on Temperature Projections,"Decadal (similar to 10-year)-scale flow projections in the Colorado River Basin (CRB) are increasingly important for water resources management and planning of its reservoir system. Physical models, ensemble streamflow prediction (ESP), do not have skill beyond interannual time scales. However, Global Climate Models have good skill in projecting decadal temperatures. This, combined with the sensitivity of CRB flows to temperature from recent studies, motivate the research question, can skill in decadal temperature projections be translated to operationally skillful flow projections and consequently, water resources management? To explore this, we used temperature projections from the Community Earth System Model-Decadal Prediction Large Ensemble (CESM-DPLE) along with past basin runoff efficiency as covariates in a Random Forest (RF) method to project ensembles of multiyear mean flow at the key aggregate gauge of Lees Ferry, Arizona. RF streamflow projections outperformed both ESP and climatology in a 1982-2017 hindcast, as measured by ranked probability skill score. The projections were disaggregated to monthly and subbasin scales to drive the Colorado River Mid-term Modeling System (CRMMS) to generate ensembles of water management variables. The projections of pool elevations in Lakes Powell and Mead, the two largest U.S. reservoirs that are critical for water resources management in the basin, were found to reduce the hindcast median root mean square error by up to -20% and -30% at lead times of 48 and 60 months, respectively, relative to projections generated from ESP. This suggests opportunities for enhancing water resources management in the CRB and potentially elsewhere.",https://doi.org/10.1029/2021WR030936,10.1029/2021WR030936,"Woodson, David; Rajagopalan, Balaji; Baker, Sarah; Smith, Rebecca; Prairie, James; Towler, Erin; Ge, Ming; Zagona, Edith",WATER RESOURCES RESEARCH,water resources; streamflow forecasting; Colorado River; climate projections; machine learning; Random Forest,WESTERN NORTH-AMERICA; PREDICTION SKILL; WATER-RESOURCES; MODEL; DROUGHT; PRECIPITATION; UNCERTAINTIES; VERIFICATION; SIMULATIONS; VARIABILITY,,AMER GEOPHYSICAL UNION,WASHINGTON,"2000 FLORIDA AVE NW, WASHINGTON, DC 20009 USA",0043-1397,1944-7973,,WATER RESOUR RES,Water Resour.

28,Mid-21st century projections of hydroclimate in Western Himalayas and Satluj River basin,"The Himalayan climate system is sensitive to global warming and climate change. Regional hydrology and the downstream water flow in the rivers of Himalayan origin may change due to variations in snow and glacier melt in the region. This study examines the mid-21st century climate projections over western Himalayas from the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project Phase 5 (CMIP5) global climate models under Representative Concentration Pathways (RCP) scenarios (RCP4.5 and RCP8.5). All the global climate models used in the present analysis indicate that the study region would be warmer by mid-century. The temperature trends from all the models studied here are statistically significant at 95% confidence interval. Multi-model ensemble spreads show that there are large differences among the models in their projections of future climate with spread in temperature ranging from about 1.5 degrees C to 5 degrees C over various areas of western Himalayas in all the seasons. Spread in precipitation projections lies between 0.3 and 1 mm/day in all the seasons. Major shift in the timing of evaporation maxima and minima is noticed. The GFDL_ESM2G model products have been downscaled to Satluj River basin using the weather research and forecast (WRF) model and impact of climate change on streamflow has been studied. The reduction of precipitation during JJAS is expected to be > 3-6 mm/day in RCP8.5 as compared to present climate. It is expected that precipitation amount shall increase over Satluj basin in future (mid-21st century) The soil and water assessment tool (SWAT) model has been used to simulate the Satluj streamflow for the present and future climate using GFDL_ESM2G precipitation and temperature data as well as the WRF model downscaled data. The computations using the global model data show that total annual discharge from Satluj will be less in future than that in present climate, especially in peak discharge season (JJAS). The SWAT model with downscaled output indicates that during winter and spring, more discharge shall occur in future (RCP8.5) in Satluj River.",https://doi.org/10.1016/j.gloplacha.2017.10.013,10.1016/j.gloplacha.2017.10.013,"Tiwari, Sarita; Kar, Sarat C.; Bhatla, R.",GLOBAL AND PLANETARY CHANGE,,CLIMATE-CHANGE; NORTHWESTERN HIMALAYA; IMPACT ASSESSMENT; TIME-SERIES; PART II; PRECIPITATION; MODEL; HYDROLOGY; SNOW; STATIONARITY,,ELSEVIER,AMSTERDAM,"RADARWEG 29, 1043 NX AMSTERDAM, NETHERLANDS",0921-8181,1872-6364,,GLOBAL PLANET CHANGE,Glob.

29,Forecast Informed Reservoir Operations Using Ensemble Streamflow Predictions for a Multipurpose Reservoir in Northern California,"Ensemble Forecast Operations (EFO) is a risk-based approach of reservoir flood control operations that incorporates ensemble streamflow predictions (ESPs) made by the California-Nevada River Forecast Center. Reservoir operations for each member of an ESP are individually modeled to forecast system conditions and calculate risk of reaching critical operational thresholds. Reservoir release decisions are simulated to manage forecasted risk with respect to established risk tolerance levels. EFO was developed for Lake Mendocino, a 111,000 acre-foot reservoir near Ukiah, California, to evaluate its viability to improve reservoir storage reliability without increasing downstream flood risk. Lake Mendocino is a dual use reservoir, owned and operated for flood control by the United States Army Corps of Engineers and operated for water supply by Sonoma Water. EFO was simulated using a 26-year (1985-2010) ESP hindcast generated by the California-Nevada River Forecast Center, which provides 61-member ensembles of 15-day flow forecasts. EFO simulations yield generally higher storage levels during the flood management season while maintaining needed flood storage capacity by strategically prereleasing water in advance of forecasted storms. Model results demonstrate a 33% increase in median storage at the end of the flood management season (10 May) over existing operations without marked changes in flood frequency for locations downstream from Lake Mendocino. EFO may be a viable alternative for managing flood control operations at Lake Mendocino that provides multiple benefits (water supply, flood mitigation, and ecosystems) and provides a management framework that could be adapted and applied to other flood control reservoirs.",https://doi.org/10.1029/2019WR026604,10.1029/2019WR026604,"Delaney, Chris J.; Hartman, Robert K.; Mendoza, John; Dettinger, Michael; Delle Monache, Luca; Jasperse, Jay; Ralph, F.

30,Castles built on sand or predictive limnology in action? Part B: Designing the next monitoring-modelling-assessment cycle of adaptive management in Lake Erie,"In Lake Erie, a wide variety of statistical and process-based models have significantly advanced our understanding of the major causal linkages/ecosystem processes underlying the local water quality problems. In this study, our aim is to identify knowledge gaps, monitoring assessment objectives, and management recommendations that should be critically reviewed through the iterative monitoring-modelling-assessment cycles of adaptive management. In the watershed, the presence of multiple SWAT applications provides assurance that a wide array of physical, chemical, and biological processes with distinct characterizations are used to reproduce the patterns of flow and nutrient export in agricultural lands. While there are models with more advanced mechanistic representation of certain facets of the hydrological cycle (surface runoff, groundwater and sediment erosion) or better equipped to depict urban settings, we believe that greater insights will be gained by revisiting several influential assumptions (tile drainage, fertilizer/manure application rates, land-use/landcover data) and recalibrating the existing SWAT models to capture both baseline and event-flow conditions and daily nutrient concentration (not loading) variability in multiple locations rather than a single downstream site. It is also critical to redesign land-use management scenarios by accommodating recent conceptual and technical advancements of their life-cycle effectiveness, the variability in their starting operational efficiency, and differential response to storm events or seasonality, as well as the role of legacy phosphorus. In the receiving waterbody, the development of data-driven models to establish causal linkages between the trophic status of Lake Erie and external phosphorus loading represents a pragmatic means to draw forecasts regarding the phyto-plankton community response to different management actions. Two critical next steps to further augment the empirical modelling work is the iterative updating as more data are acquired through monitoring and the introduction of additional explanatory variables that are likely associated with the occurrence of cyanobacteria-dominated blooms. The majority of the process-based models are not constrained by the available data, and therefore their primary value is their use as heuristic tools to advance our understanding of Lake Erie. The validation of their predictive power should become one of the overarching objectives of the iterative monitoring-modelling-assessment cycles. With respect to the projected responses of the system to nutrient loading reduction, we express our skepticism with the optimistic predictions of the extent and duration of hypoxia, given our limited knowledge of the sediment diagenesis processes in the central basin along with the lack of data related to the vertical profiles of organic matter and phosphorus fractionation or sedimentation/burial rates. Our study also questions the adequacy of the coarse spatiotemporal (seasonal/annual, basin- or lake-wide) scales characterizing the philosophy of both water quality management objectives and modelling enterprise in Lake Erie, as this strategy seems somewhat disconnected from the ecosystem services targeted. We conclude by emphasizing that the valuation of ecosystem services should be integrated into the decision-making process, as we track the evolution of the system over time.",https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ecoinf.2019.05.015,10.1016/j.ecoinf.2019.05.015,"Arhonditsis, George B.; Neumann, Alex; Shimoda, Yuko; Kim, Dong-Kyun; Dong, Feifei; Onandia, Gabriela; Yang, Cindy; Javed, Aisha; Brady, Meghan; Visha, Ariola; Ni, Felicity; Cheng, Vincent",ECOLOGICAL INFORMATICS,Lake Erie; Best management practices; Uncertainty analysis; Adaptive management implementation; Integrated modelling framework,INTEGRATIVE METHODOLOGICAL FRAMEWORK; ENVIRONMENTAL CRITERIA EVALUATION; LAURENTIAN GREAT-LAKES; HARMFUL ALGAL BLOOMS; WATER-QUALITY; ECOSYSTEM SERVICES; PHOSPHORUS LOADS; CURRENT STATE; HAMILTON HARBOR; NUTRIENT INPUTS,,ELSEVIER,AMSTERDAM,"RADARWEG 29, 1043 NX AMSTERDAM, NETHERLANDS",1574-9541,1878-0512,,ECOL INFORM,Ecol.

31,Efficient multi-scenario Model Predictive Control for water resources management with ensemble streamflow forecasts,"Model Predictive Control (MPC) is one of the most advanced real-time control techniques that has been widely applied to Water Resources Management (WRM). MPC can manage the water system in a holistic manner and has a flexible structure to incorporate specific elements, such as setpoints and constraints. Therefore, MPC has shown its versatile performance in many branches of WRM. Nonetheless, with the in-depth understanding of stochastic hydrology in recent studies, MPC also faces the challenge of how to cope with hydrological uncertainty in its decision-making process. A possible way to embed the uncertainty is to generate an Ensemble Forecast (EF) of hydrological variables, rather than a deterministic one. The combination of MPC and EF results in a more comprehensive approach: Multi-scenario MPC (MS-MPC). In this study, we will first assess the model performance of MS-MPC, considering an ensemble streamflow forecast. Noticeably, the computational inefficiency may be a critical obstacle that hinders applicability of MS-MPC. In fact, with more scenarios taken into account, the computational burden of solving an optimization problem in MS-MPC accordingly increases. To deal with this challenge, we propose the Adaptive Control Resolution (ACR) approach as a computationally efficient scheme to practically reduce the number of control variables in MS-MPC. In brief, the ACR approach uses a mixed-resolution control time step from the near future to the distant future. The ACR-MPC approach is tested on a real-world case study: an integrated flood control and navigation problem in the North Sea Canal of the Netherlands. Such an approach reduces the computation time by 18% and up in our case study. At the same time, the model performance of ACR-MPC remains close to that of conventional MPC. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd.

32,Fishing in greener waters: Understanding the impact of harmful algal blooms on Lake Erie anglers and the potential for adoption of a forecast model,"Harmful algal blooms (HABs) pose public health risks worldwide, because of the toxins that they can produce. Researchers have explored the impact of HABs on local economies, but know relatively little about the decision making that informs these behaviors that lead to financial losses. Understanding the factors that inform this decision-making is critical to developing mitigative solutions. This study seeks to understand how HABs in Western Lake Erie affect angler decision-making, before evaluating a possible decision-support tool a harmful algal bloom forecast known as the Experimental Lake Erie HAB Tracker. The HAB Tracker provides a nowcast and five-day forecast of the spatial distribution and transport of Microcystis, the predominant species of harmful algae in Western Lake Erie. Data collected using focus groups and surveys were coded to identify key themes that influence angler decision-making. The theory of the diffusion of innovations provides an analytical framework to evaluate the potential for widespread adoption of the HAB forecast among Lake Erie anglers. Analysis of emerging themes revealed that Lake Erie anglers face three key decision-points when fishing in HABs: whether to fish, where to fish, and whether to eat the fish. Five primary variables factored into angler decisions on where and whether to fish including 1) perceptions of HAB aesthetics, 2) perceptions of the impact of HABs on angler health, 3) perceptions of the impact of HABs on fish, 4) communication methods, 5) perceptions of HABs by customers of charter captains. Most participants in this study sought to avoid fishing in HABs primarily for aesthetic reasons. Recreational anglers are more likely than charter captains to adopt the HAS Tracker as a decision-support tool, because it is compatible with their information needs and provides a relative advantage over existing sources of information. Charter captains are less likely to adopt the HAB Tracker, because they rely on their existing knowledge and social network for HAB information. If researchers can reduce the complexity of forecast information while increasing its accessibility and reliability, then all anglers will be more likely to adopt a HAS forecast as a decision-support tool while fishing in Lake Erie during bloom season.",https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jenvman.2018.08.074,10.1016/j.jenvman.2018.08.074,"Gill, Devin; Rowe, Mark; Joshi, Sonia Joseph",JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL MANAGEMENT,Harmful algal bloom; Lake Erie; Fishing; Stakeholder engagement; HAB forecast,RISK PERCEPTION; CYANOBACTERIA; CONSUMPTION; FISHERMEN; LESSONS,,ACADEMIC PRESS LTD- ELSEVIER SCIENCE LTD,LONDON,"24-28 OVAL RD, LONDON NW1 7DX, ENGLAND",0301-4797,1095-8630,,J ENVIRON MANAGE,J.

33,Projected compositional shifts and loss of ecosystem services in freshwater fish communities under climate change scenarios,"What are the projected impacts of climate change on community composition and consequentially on the distribution of functional traits? Answers to these questions are somewhat unclear but critical for designing ecological management strategies. Here we forecast potential impacts of climate change on freshwater lake fish communities of Ontario, Canada, by contrasting species composition, species richness, functional diversity and functional composition for present versus projected communities under best-case and business-as-usual climate change scenarios. Results indicate that the composition of projected communities differs from present, and includes a shift from cold- and cool-water species to warm-water species. Species richness in projected communities is estimated to increase by 60-81%, but functional diversity is estimated to decline. These projected communities are estimated to have on average 22% shorter mean body length, 38% lighter body weight and 36% less fecundity than present. Also, the present configuration of sport and commercially important fishes are projected to decline in their distribution, potentially impacting ecosystem services associated with commercial and recreational fisheries. Together, climate change may initiate a compositional shift that may result in an important shift in community functional structure, which is likely to affect important aquatic ecosystem services.",https://doi.org/10.1007/s10750-017-3208-1,10.1007/s10750-017-3208-1,"Biswas, Shekhar R.; Vogt, Richard J.; Sharma, Sapna",HYDROBIOLOGIA,Compositional shift; Ecosystem services; Species distribution models; Trait analysis,FUNCTIONAL DIVERSITY; CHANGE IMPACTS; SPECIES DISTRIBUTION; DISTRIBUTION MODELS; POTENTIAL IMPACTS; BIODIVERSITY LOSS; THERMAL HABITAT; SMALLMOUTH BASS; ASSEMBLAGES; POPULATIONS,,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0018-8158,1573-5117,,HYDROBIOLOGIA,Hydrobiologia,SEP,2017,799,1,135,149,,
34,Efficient River Management using Stochastic MPC and Ensemble Forecast of Uncertain In-flows,"Efficient river management is essential in improving water resource utilisation. However, river flows and water-levels are affected by unregulated in- and out-flows. Therefore, it is important to consider the forecasts of these unregulated flows and the uncertainties in the forecasts. The paper describes control and modelling tools from the literature that suit the river management problem. Specifically, a scenario-based Stochastic Model Predictive Control (MPC) strategy, that makes use of ensemble forecast of unregulated flows, is proposed, where the ensemble forecast contains multiple flow scenarios to characterise future flows and their uncertainties, and are obtained from catchment hydrological models.

35,Improving forecasting accuracy of river flow using gene expression programming based on wavelet decomposition and de-noising,"Due to the effects of anthropogenic activities and natural climate change, streamflows of rivers have gradually decreased. In order to maintain reliable water supplies, reservoir operation and water resource management, accurate streamflow forecasts are very important. Based on monthly flow data from five hydrological stations in the middle and lower parts of the Hanjiang River Basin, between 1989 and 2009, we consider an efficient approach of adopting the gene expression programming model based on wavelet decomposition and de-noising (WDDGEP) to forecast river flow. Original flow time series data are initially decomposed into one sub-signal approximation and seven sub-signal details using the dmey wavelet. A wavelet threshold de-noising method is also applied in this study. Data that have been de-noised after decomposition are then adopted as inputs for WDDGEP models. Finally, the forecasted sub-signal results are summed to formulate an ensemble forecast for the original monthly flow series. A comparison of the prediction accuracy between the two models is based on three performance evaluation measures. Results show that the new WDDGEP models can effectively enhance accuracy in forecasting streamflow, and the proposed wavelet-based de-noising of the observed non-stationary time series is an effective measure to improve simulation accuracy.",https://doi.org/10.2166/nh.2017.115,10.2166/nh.2017.115,"Lu, Xiaorong; Wang, Xuelei; Zhang, Liang; Zhang, Ting; Yang, Chao; Song, XinXin; Yang, Qing",HYDROLOGY RESEARCH,flow forecasting; gene expression programming; wavelet transformation; WDDGEP models,TIME-SERIES; PERFORMANCE; RUNOFF; TRANSFORM; RAINFALL; MODEL; RESPONSES; SUPPORT; GEP,,IWA PUBLISHING,LONDON,"ALLIANCE HOUSE, 12 CAXTON ST, LONDON SW1H0QS, ENGLAND",1998-9563,2224-7955,,HYDROL RES,Hydrol.

36,Development and evaluation of a real-time forecasting framework for daily water quality forecasts for Lake Chaohu to Lead time of six days,"The socioeconomic benefits associated with informative water quality forecasts for large lakes are becoming increasingly evident. However, it remains an enormous challenge to produce forecasts of water quality variables that are accurate enough to meet public demand. In this study, we developed and evaluated a new forecast framework for real-time forecasting of daily dissolved oxygen (DO), ammonium nitrogen (NH), total phosphorus (TP) and total nitrogen (TN) concentrations at lead times from one to six days for Lake Chaohu, the fifth largest freshwater lake in China. The forecast framework is based on a 3-D hydrodynamic ecological model referred to as EcoLake. We used hydrological, meteorological and water quality data from multiple sources to generate initial conditions and forcing functions. Solar radiation and inflows from tributaries which are not readily available were calculated using forecasted cloud cover and rainfall. Forecast skill was evaluated based on 122 forecasts produced on different days in 2017 and for each of the 12 sampling sites. Results indicate that the skill of the forecast framework varies considerably across water quality variables, sampling sites, and lead times. Generally, the forecast framework is more skillful than the persistence forecasts, which use the most recent observations as forecasts. The TN forecasts tend to be the most skillful with a mean RMSE skill score of 28.5% averaged across the six lead times. The DO forecasts tend to have the lowest skill with an average value of 10.9%. Model sensitivity experiments further revealed that errors in the raw air temperature and wind speed forecasts have a noticeable impact on the overall skill of DO and NH forecasts. The forecast framework proposed here could be a useful operational forecasting tool to enhance the effectiveness of the drinking water supply and public health protection based on the water quality management of Lake Chaohu.

37,Ensemble forecasting of Corbicula fluminea worldwide distribution: Projections of the impact of climate change,"Global biodiversity is at risk owing to climate change, and freshwater ecosystems are expected to suffer the most. In recent years niche-based models (NBMs) have been used to predict species distribution and are an important tool for conservation and management of aquatic ecosystems. In this work, the current and future climatic suitability areas of the invasive species Corbicula fluminea, which has known adverse ecological and economic impacts, were investigated. The species distribution modelling was based on nine algorithms in BIOMOD2, summarized in an ensemble forecasting approach. To model the species distribution, eight climatic parameters related to temperature and precipitation variables were considered. Three time frames (current, 2050 and 2070) were modelled using four increasing CO2 emission scenarios. The performance of individual models was excellent according to the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) and good to excellent according to true skill statistics (TSS). Annual mean temperature, minimum temperature of the coldest month and mean temperature of the coldest quarter were the most important variables predicting C. fluminea occurrence. Of the total continental area, 6.6% was predicted to be suitable for C. fluminea in current conditions. In the future, suitable area will increase from the current value of 6.6% to values from 9.4% to 12.6%, according to the 2050 projections and up to 12.7% in 2070 in high emission scenarios. Overall, the results indicate that climate change will favour the expansion of C. fluminea into new river basins, especially at higher latitudes, and that future climatic scenarios may double the suitable area for Corbicula fluminea.",https://doi.org/10.1002/aqc.2767,10.1002/aqc.2767,"Gama, Mafalda; Crespo, Daniel; Dolbeth, Marina; Anastacio, Pedro Manuel",AQUATIC CONSERVATION-MARINE AND FRESHWATER ECOSYSTEMS,alien species; biodiversity; climate change; invertebrates; modelling; stream,FRESH-WATER CLAM; SPECIES DISTRIBUTION; INVASIVE BIVALVE; BIOLOGICAL INVASIONS; DREISSENA-POLYMORPHA; DISTRIBUTION MODELS; INLAND WATERS; DIE-OFFS; MULLER; RIVER,,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",1052-7613,1099-0755,,AQUAT CONSERV,Aquat.

38,"Predicting groundwater level fluctuations under climate change scenarios for Tasuj plain, Iran","Coastal aquifers world-wide are being confronted with several major challenges, such as overextraction of groundwater, climate change impacts, contamination by wastewater, and saltwater intrusion into water resources. Climate change induced alteration of the hydrological cycle is one of the main threats to future accessibility of water resources. Effective prediction of possible impacts of climate change on groundwater reserves, a crucial water resource, could be of great importance for sustainable water management. In a comparative study, artificial neural network (ANN), least square support vector machine (LSSVM), and nonlinear autoregressive network with exogenous inputs (NARX) models was applied to evaluate possible impacts of three representative concentration pathways (RCP) climate change scenarios (RCP2.6, RCP4.5, RCP8.5) on groundwater levels in Tasuj Plain, Iran. Four general circulation models (GCM) was used to predict temperature and precipitation values for the future period 2022-2050 and found that future temperature increased, while the amount of precipitation decreased. To improve the accuracy of three models in groundwater level prediction, db4 wavelet transform was applied. The results indicated that the Wavelet-NARX approach gave the best accuracy in forecasting groundwater level in the study area. In all cases, prediction indicated that groundwater level in all representative wells would decline in future.",https://doi.org/10.1007/s12517-021-06508-6,10.1007/s12517-021-06508-6,"Ghazi, Babak; Jeihouni, Esmaeil; Kalantari, Zahra",ARABIAN JOURNAL OF GEOSCIENCES,Climate change; Groundwater level; Artificial intelligence techniques; Tasuj plain,SUPPORT VECTOR MACHINE; NEURAL-NETWORK MODELS; POTENTIAL IMPACTS; SHABESTAR PLAIN; LAKE URMIA; LAND-USE; WAVELET; WATER; SIMULATION; QUALITY,,SPRINGER HEIDELBERG,HEIDELBERG,"TIERGARTENSTRASSE 17, D-69121 HEIDELBERG, GERMANY",1866-7511,1866-7538,,ARAB J GEOSCI,Arab.

39,Ensemble hydrological forecasts for reservoir management of the Shipshaw River catchment using limited data,"Many hydropower companies continue to rely on expert judgment to manage the operations of their reservoirs. Decision-support systems, composed of a hydrological forecasting system and a reservoir model, can ensure that reservoir operation objectives are attained more effectively than by relying solely on expert judgment. In this study, a simple ensemble inflow forecasting system coupled with a reservoir model is developed and the proposed model-based operational water management decisions are compared with those based on expert judgment for the Shipshaw River in Quebec, Canada. Given that no natural streamflow records are available for the Shipshaw River, the HEC-HMS hydrological model is calibrated using a regionalization method based on physical similarity. The calibrated hydrological model is fed by ensemble meteorological forecasts that include 20 members, with a 10-day horizon and a 6-hour time step. The proposed decision-support system can help avoid small flooding events while potentially improving energy production by 2 to 60% for this case study. The proposed forecasting system also allows water-resource managers to anticipate events with a greater lead time.",https://doi.org/10.1080/07011784.2020.1834880,10.1080/07011784.2020.1834880,"Reig, Estelle; Boucher, Marie-Amelie; Tremblay, Eric",CANADIAN WATER RESOURCES JOURNAL,Hydropower; reservoir management; streamflow forecasts; HEC-HMS; HEC-ResSim; ensemble meteorological forecasts; ungauged catchments; regionalization by physical similarity,CLIMATE-CHANGE; MODEL; REGIONALIZATION; WATER; UNCERTAINTY; TEMPERATURE; PREDICTION; GENERATION; OPERATION; IMPACTS,,TAYLOR & FRANCIS INC,PHILADELPHIA,"530 WALNUT STREET, STE 850, PHILADELPHIA, PA 19106 USA",0701-1784,1918-1817,,CAN WATER RESOUR J,Can.

40,Hindcast and forecast of daily inundation extents using satellite SAR and altimetry data with rotated empirical orthogonal function analysis: Case study in Tonle Sap Lake Floodplain,"The Tonle Sap Lake (TSL) is the largest natural freshwater lake in Southeast Asia and is called the heart of the lower Mekong due to its high aquatic biodiversity and is considered as one of the most productive freshwater ecosystems of the world. Its floodplain eco-system, which is strongly tied to seasonal flood pulse, is extremely important for food security, trade and economy of Cambodia, supporting the livelihoods of about 1.7 million people. On the other hand, flood can also be extremely devastating in the region along the TSL. In recent years, studies have pointed out that rapid growing number of water infrastructures as well as future climate changes may alter the hydrological cycle of the Mekong River Basin (MRB) and are expected to influence the flood pulse of the TSL and surrounding TSL floodplain. Therefore, it is timely to understand historical inundation extent and predict its likely future state. In this study, we proposed a Rotated Empirical Orthogonal Function (REOF) analysis-based daily inundation extent estimation framework, integrating multi-temporal stack of Sentinel-1A Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) imagery and Jason-series satellite altimetry data. The framework can generate daily, cloud-free and gap-free inundation extents for any given time depending on the altimetry data provided. A long-term El Nino and Southern Oscillation (ENSO) index-based daily TSL level forecasting method with months of lead time was also proposed to fulfill the framework's forecasting capacity. In this study, the framework was adopted in the TSL floodplain area for hindcast (2003 to 2015) and forecast (January to July 2019) of daily inundation extents. Estimated inundation extents were cross-compared with MODIS-derived and Sentinel-1-derived inundation maps, resulting in up to higher than 90% of Critical Success Index (CSI). The proposed framework has (1) innovative capacity of estimation of future daily areal inundation extents and is (2) a fully remote sensing-based framework which can empower local authorities tasked with water resource management decisions without relying on upstream countries. The framework has potential to be implemented in other major river basins or wetlands (e.g., Amazon River Basin, and Congo River Basin). The implementation on SAR imagery from other satellites with different bands of electromagnetic wave is also possible but requires more investigation.",https://doi.org/10.1016/j.rse.2020.111732,10.1016/j.rse.2020.111732,"Chang, Chi-Hung; Lee, Hyongki; Kim, Donghwan; Hwang, Euiho; Hossain, Faisal; Chishtie, Farrukh; Jayasinghe, Susantha; Basnayake, Senaka",REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT,Daily inundation extents estimation; Mekong River Basin; Tonle Sap Lake; SAR; Satellite altimetry; EOF analysis; Flood forecast,SEA-LEVEL RISE; VIETNAMESE MEKONG DELTA; CENTRAL CONGO RIVER; CLIMATE-CHANGE; SURFACE-WATER; TIME-SERIES; RADAR ALTIMETRY; FLOODED VEGETATION; GLOBAL WATERPACK; EOF ANALYSIS,,ELSEVIER SCIENCE INC,NEW YORK,"STE 800, 230 PARK AVE, NEW YORK, NY 10169 USA",0034-4257,1879-0704,,REMOTE SENS ENVIRON,Remote Sens.

41,Predictability of Seasonal Streamflow Forecasting Based on CSM: Case Studies of Top Three Largest Rivers in China,"Accurate seasonal streamflow forecasting is important in reservoir operation, watershed planning, and water resource management, and streamflow forecasting is often based on hydrological models driven by coupled global climate models (CGCMs). To understand streamflow forecasting predictability, this study considered the three largest rivers in China and explored deterministic and probabilistic skill metrics on the monthly scale according to ensemble streamflow hindcasts from the hydrological model Hydrologiska Byrans Vattenbalansavdelning (HBV) driven by multiple climate forcings from the climate system model by the Beijing Climate Center (BCC_CSM1.1m). The effects of initial conditions (ICs) and meteorological forcings (MFs) on skill were investigated using the conventional ensemble streamflow prediction (ESP) and reverse-ESP (revESP). The results revealed the following: (1) Skill declines as lead time increases, and forecasting is generally the most skillful for lead month 1; (2) skill is higher for dry rivers than wet rivers, and higher for dry target months than wet months for the Yellow and Yangtze Rivers, suggesting greater skill in potential drought forecasting than flood forecasting; (3) the relative operating characteristic (ROC) area is greater for abnormal terciles than the near-normal tercile for all three rivers, greater for the above-normal tercile than the below-normal tercile for the Yellow and Yangtze Rivers, but slightly greater for the below-normal tercile than the above-normal tercile for the Xijiang River; and (4) the influence of ICs outweighs that of MFs in dry months, and the period of influence varies from 1 to 3 months; however, the influence of MFs is dominant in wet target months. These findings will help improve the understanding of both the seasonal streamflow forecasting predictability based on coupled climate system/hydrological models and of streamflow forecasting for variable rivers and seasons.",https://doi.org/10.3390/w13020162,10.3390/w13020162,"Liu, Lyuliu; Wu, Ying; Zhang, Peiqun; Zhai, Jianqing; Zhang, Li; Xiao, Chan",WATER,Pearl River; predictability; seasonal streamflow forecasting; Yangtze River; Yellow River,,,MDPI,BASEL,"ST ALBAN-ANLAGE 66, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND",,2073-4441,,WATER-SUI,Water,JAN,2021,13,2,,,162,
42,Web-based data analytics framework for well forecasting and groundwater quality,"Groundwater supplies drinking water for over one-third of all Americans. However, with aquifers stressed by overdraft, contamination from land use, and the hydrologic impacts of climate change, identifying reliable sources for new wells is increasingly challenging. Well forecasting is a process in which potential groundwater resources are evaluated for a location of interest. While this process forecasts the depth of each aquifer for a given location, it takes historical groundwater well data from nearby locations into account. Conventionally, well forecasting is done by geological survey professionals by manually analyzing the well data and, that makes the process both time and resource-intensive. This study presents a novel web application that performs well forecasting for any location within the state of Iowa in a matter of seconds utilizing client-side computing instead of expensive professional labor. The web application generates well forecasts by triangulating millions of combinations of historical aquifer depth data of nearby wells stored in a state-level database. The proposed web system also provides water quality information for arsenic, nitrate, and bacteria (total c and fecal coliform) on the same interface with forecasts. The system is open to the public and is aimed to provide a go-to tool for homeowners, well drillers and, authorities to help inform decision-making regarding groundwater well development and water quality monitoring efforts.

43,"Advancing lake and reservoir water quality management with near-term, iterative ecological forecasting","Near-term, iterative ecological forecasts with quantified uncertainty have great potential for improving lake and reservoir management. For example, if managers received a forecast indicating a high likelihood of impending impairment, they could make decisions today to prevent or mitigate poor water quality in the future. Increasing the number of automated, real-time freshwater forecasts used for management requires integrating interdisciplinary expertise to develop a framework that seamlessly links data, models, and cyberinfrastructure, as well as collaborations with managers to ensure that forecasts are embedded into decision-making workflows. The goal of this study is to advance the implementation of near-term, iterative ecological forecasts for freshwater management. We first provide an overview of FLARE (Forecasting Lake And Reservoir Ecosystems), a forecasting framework we developed and applied to a drinking water reservoir to assist water quality management, as a potential open-source option for interested users. We used FLARE to develop scenario forecasts simulating different water quality interventions to inform manager decision-making. Second, we share lessons learned from our experience developing and running FLARE over 2 years to inform other forecasting projects. We specifically focus on how to develop, implement, and maintain a forecasting system used for active management. Our goal is to break down the barriers to forecasting for freshwater researchers, with the aim of improving lake and reservoir management globally.",https://doi.org/10.1080/20442041.2020.1816421,10.1080/20442041.2020.1816421,"Carey, Cayelan C.; Woelmer, Whitney M.; Lofton, Mary E.; Figueiredo, Renato J.; Bookout, Bethany J.; Corrigan, Rachel S.; Daneshmand, Vahid; Hounshell, Alexandria G.; Howard, Dexter W.; Lewis, Abigail S.

44,Developing the Coupled CWRF-FVCOM Modeling System to Understand and Predict Atmosphere-Watershed Interactions Over the Great Lakes Region,"Coupling 3-D hydrodynamics with climate models is necessary but difficult for resolving multiscale interactions and has been rarely implemented in predicting Great Lakes' water level fluctuations because of issues in treating net basin supply (NBS) components and connecting channel flows. This study developed an interactive lake-atmosphere-hydrology modeling system by coupling the regional Climate-Weather Research and Forecasting model (CWRF) with the 3-D unstructured-grid Finite Volume Coastal Ocean Model (FVCOM) in the Great Lakes region. The sensitivity of the coupled system, relative to the CWRF baseline using the 1-D Lake, Ice, Snow and Sediment Simulator (LISSS), was evaluated in representing lake-climate conditions during 1999-2015 against observations. As coupled with CWRF, FVCOM outperformed LISSS in simulating water surface temperature, ice cover, and vertical thermal structure at seasonal to interannual scales for all the five lakes and realistically reproduced the regional circulation patterns. In warm seasons, the improved lake conditions significantly corrected LISSS overestimates of surface air temperature together with larger-scale circulation changes. Consequently, precipitation was generally reduced over each lake basin, mainly because of decreased surface moisture and heat fluxes along with enhanced atmospheric stability. Through the dynamic coupling, FVCOM predicts the water level fluctuations in direct response to the CWRF NBS components and connecting channel flows based on a stage-fall-discharge formulation. This coupled CWRF-FVCOM reasonably captured the NBS variations and predicted the water level fluctuations for Lakes Superior and Michigan-Huron. It represents a major advance in interacting regional climate and watershed processes to dynamically predict Great Lakes' water level seasonal-interannual variations. Plain Language Summary Coupling 3-D hydrodynamics with climate models is necessary but difficult for resolving multiscale interactions and has been rarely implemented in predicting Great Lakes' water level fluctuations because of issues in treating net basin supply (NBS) components and connecting channel flows. We developed an interactive lake-atmosphere- hydrology modeling system by coupling the regional Climate-Weather Research and Forecasting model (CWRF) with the 3-D unstructured-grid Finite Volume Coastal Ocean Model (FVCOM) and compared it with the baseline CWRF configured with 1-D lake model to understand how 3-D hydrodynamic processes affect the prediction of the lake and regional climate conditions. The coupled CWRF-FVCOM system significantly improved the simulation of all the five lakes' conditions at seasonal to interannual scales and realistically reproduced the regional circulation patterns. Our analysis also explained the processes that are associated with such sensitivity. Furthermore, as a unique contribution to the literature, we constructed FVCOM to dynamically predict the water level fluctuations in direct response to the coupled CWRF NBS components and connecting channel flows based on a stage-fall-discharge formulation.

45,The relative importance of environmental factors in predicting phytoplankton shifting and cyanobacteria abundance in regulated shallow lakes,"The phytoplankton community can be affected by multiple environmental factors such as climate, meteorology, hydrology, nutrients, and grazing. The complex interactive effects of these environmental factors as well as the resilience of phytoplankton communities further make the prediction of phytoplankton communities' dynamics challenging. In this study, we analyzed multiple environmental factors and their relative importance in predicting both phytoplankton shifting and cyanobacteria abundance in two regulated shallow lakes in central China. Our results indicated that the phytoplankton community in the study areas could be mainly classified into 1. Cryptophyta dominated group, 2. Biologically diverse group, and 3. Cyanobacteria dominated group. The Multinomial Logistic Regression model indicated the Cryptophyta dominated group was sensitive to temperature, while other groups were sensitive to both temperature and nutrients. The interactive effects of temperature and nutrients were synergistic in the cyanobacteria dominated group, while they were antagonistic or minor in other groups. The Negative Binomial Regression model suggested high total phosphorus and low total nitrogen but not temperature were responsible for high cyanobacteria abundance. The conditional plot indicated nutrients affected cyanobacteria abundance more significantly under low wind speeds and lake volume fluctuations, and cyanobacteria abundance in the cyanobacteria dominated group maintained high levels with increasing hydrological dynamics. Our results demonstrated that environmental factors played inconsistently significant roles in different phytoplankton groups, and reducing nutrients could decrease adverse effects of warming and water project constructions. Our models can also be applied to forecast phytoplankton shifting and cyanobacteria abundance in the management of regulated shallow lakes.",https://doi.org/10.1016/j.envpol.2021.117555,10.1016/j.envpol.2021.117555,"Rao, Ke; Zhang, Xiang; Wang, Mo; Liu, Jianfeng; Guo, Wenqi; Huang, Guangwei; Xu, Jing",ENVIRONMENTAL POLLUTION,Community prediction; Cyanobacteria blooms; Environmental drivers; Multinomial logistic regression; Negative binomial regression,CHLOROPHYLL-A; WATER-QUALITY; NUTRIENT LOAD; PHOSPHORUS; NITROGEN; EUTROPHICATION; TEMPERATURE; DOMINANCE; RESERVOIR; CLIMATE,,ELSEVIER SCI LTD,OXFORD,"THE BOULEVARD, LANGFORD LANE, KIDLINGTON, OXFORD OX5 1GB, OXON, ENGLAND",0269-7491,1873-6424,,ENVIRON POLLUT,Environ.

46,Changes in Climate and Land Cover Affect Seasonal Streamflow Forecasts in the Rio Grande Headwaters,"Seasonal streamflow forecast bias, changes in climate, snowpack, and land cover, and the effects of these changes on relations between basin-wide snowpack, SNOw TELemetry (SNOTEL) station snowpack, and seasonal streamflow were evaluated in the headwaters of the Rio Grande, Colorado. Results indicate that shifts in the seasonality of precipitation and changing climatology are consistent with periods of overprediction and underprediction in streamflow forecasts. Multiple linear regression of SNOTEL data, postcedent precipitation, and land-cover changes explained 2%-18% more variability in streamflow prediction than using SNOTEL station data alone. Simulated basin-wide snowpack from a physically based model had significant negative trends in snow water equivalent (-4.33 mm/yr) and snow-covered area (-0.05%/yr) during the melt period April-June. Simulated streamflow from a precipitation-runoff model increased an average 5% when the effects of bark beetle-induced tree mortality were compared to a baseline simulation with static vegetation. The effects of a 2013 wildfire increased simulated seasonal streamflow an average 35% for 1-4 years postfire. The combined effects of climate and land-cover changes on snowpack-streamflow relations highlight the difficulty in seasonal streamflow forecasting, which has important implications for water-resource management.",https://doi.org/10.1111/1752-1688.12863,10.1111/1752-1688.12863,"Penn, Colin A.; Clow, David W.; Sexstone, Graham A.; Murphy, Sheila F.",JOURNAL OF THE AMERICAN WATER RESOURCES ASSOCIATION,Rio Grande; hydrologic modeling; snow hydrology; streamflow forecasting,SNOW WATER EQUIVALENT; WESTERN UNITED-STATES; DAILY SOLAR-RADIATION; DRIVEN DISTURBANCES; COMPLEX TERRAIN; POSTFIRE RUNOFF; WILDFIRE; MODEL; RIVER; PRECIPITATION,,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",1093-474X,1752-1688,,J AM WATER RESOUR AS,J.

47,"Application of Integrated Artificial Neural Networks Based on Decomposition Methods to Predict Streamflow at Upper Indus Basin, Pakistan","Consistent streamflow forecasts play a fundamental part in flood risk mitigation. Population increase and water cycle intensification are extending not only globally but also among Pakistan's water resources. The frequency of floods has increased in the last few decades in the country, which emphasizes the importance of efficient practices needed to adopt for various aspects of water resource management such as reservoir scheduling, water sustainability, and water supply. The purpose of this study is to develop a novel hybrid model for streamflow forecasting and validate its efficiency at the upper Indus basin (UIB), Pakistan. Maximum streamflow in the River Indus from its upper mountain basin results from melting snow or glaciers and climatic unevenness of both precipitation and temperature inputs, which will, therefore, affect rural livelihoods at both a local and a regional scale through effects on runoff in the Upper Indus basin (UIB). This indicates that basins receive the bulk of snowfall input to sustain the glacier system. The present study will help find the runoff from high altitude catchments and estimated flood occurrence for the proposed and constructed hydropower projects of the Upper Indus basin (UIB). Due to climate variability, the upper Indus basin (UIB) was further divided into three zone named as sub-zones, zone one (z1), zone two (z2), and zone three (z3). The hybrid models are designed by incorporating artificial intelligence (AI) models, which includes Feedforward backpropagation (FFBP) and Radial basis function (RBF) with decomposition methods. This includes a discrete wavelet transform (DWT) and ensemble empirical mode decomposition (EEMD). On the basis of the autocorrelation function and the cross-correlation function of streamflow, precipitation and temperature inputs are selected for all developed models. Data have been analyzed by comparing the simulation outputs of the models with a correlation coefficient (R), root mean square errors (RMSE), Nash-Sutcliffe Efficiency (NSE), mean absolute percentage error (MAPE), and mean absolute errors (MAE). The proposed hybrid models have been applied to monthly streamflow observations from three hydrological stations and 17 meteorological stations in the UIB. The results show that the prediction accuracy of the decomposition-based models is usually better than those of AI-based models. Among the DWT and EEMD based hybrid model, EEMD has performed significantly well when compared to all other hybrid and individual AI models. The peak value analysis is also performed to confirm the results' precision rate during the flood season (May-October). The detailed comparative analysis showed that the RBFNN integrated with EEMD has better forecasting capabilities as compared to other developed models and EEMD-RBF can capture the nonlinear characteristics of the streamflow time series during the flood season with more precision.",https://doi.org/10.3390/atmos9120494,10.3390/atmos9120494,"Tayyab, Muhammad; Ahmad, Ijaz; Sun, Na; Zhou, Jianzhong; Dong, Xiaohua",ATMOSPHERE,artificial intelligence (AI); neural network (NN); Upper Indus Basin (UIB); feedforward backpropagation (FFBP); radial basis function (RBF); discrete wavelet transform (DWT); ensemble empirical mode decomposition (EEMD); eligible rate (ER),IMPROVING FORECASTING ACCURACY; EMPIRICAL MODE DECOMPOSITION; CLIMATE-CHANGE; FLOOD FREQUENCY; WATER-RESOURCES; WAVELET MODEL; RIVER-BASIN; RUNOFF; RESERVOIR; SERIES,,MDPI,BASEL,"ST ALBAN-ANLAGE 66, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND",,2073-4433,,ATMOSPHERE-BASEL,Atmosphere,DEC,2018,9,12,,,494,
48,Robust multiobjective reservoir operation and risk decision-making model for real-time flood control coping with forecast uncertainty,"Forecast uncertainty in real-time flood forecasting is the primary source of risk regarding reservoir flood control operation, affecting both reliability and safety of the entire system. Informing reservoir operation for real-time flood control coping with forecast uncertainty encourages overall robust control of risk probability, vulnerability, and resilience of upstream and downstream protection areas. Current stochastic programming models or chance constrained programming models (CCP) focuses on reducing either risk loss or vulnerability, thereby failing to ensure systematic control. This study established a robust multiobjective operation and risk decision-making model to inform reservoir operations. The proposed model includes three modules. First, a copula function was applied to capture multidimensional temporal dependences of forecast uncertainties, following which stochastic inflow scenarios were generated. Second, a robust multiobjective optimization (RMOO) model was established with the objectives of minimizing the probability of risk events, Conditional Value-at-Risk of risk loss (vulnerability) and the maximum sequential duration for both upstream and downstream areas. Then, an adaptive reference multiobjective evolutionary algorithm was used to solve the model and obtain noninferior solutions. Finally, the TOPSIS multicriteria decision-making method was introduced to select the compromise solution. Methodologies were verified by application to Xianghongdian reservoir, China. The main findings were as follows. (1) The copula function effectively captured the multidimensional positive temporal dependences of forecast uncertainties. (2) RMOO provided more widely distributed noninferior solutions than CCP, and performed better in lowering vulnerability of the system. (3) RMOO reduced the maximum release by 135.6 m(3)/s (7.33%) by increasing prerelease before the occurrence of flood peak. The proposed methodologies provide insights for supporting robust control of real-time operations of a reservoir system through simultaneous control of flood risk probability, vulnerability, and resilience.",https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jhydrol.2021.127334,10.1016/j.jhydrol.2021.127334,"Huang, Xin; Xu, Bin; Zhong, Ping-an; Yao, Hongyi; Yue, Hao; Zhu, Feilin; Lu, Qingwen; Sun, Yu; Mo, Ran; Li, Zhen; Liu, Weifeng",JOURNAL OF HYDROLOGY,Reservoir operation; Uncertainty; Multiobjective; Robust optimization; Conditional Value-at-Risk; Copula function,VALUE-AT-RISK; OF-THE-ART; STOCHASTIC OPTIMIZATION; SIMULATION; EVOLUTION,,ELSEVIER,AMSTERDAM,"RADARWEG 29, 1043 NX AMSTERDAM, NETHERLANDS",0022-1694,1879-2707,,J HYDROL,J.

Land use in this watershed has changed considerably over the last few decades, which is thought to have had an influence on river. This study was carried out as part of assessing the land use and climate change on hydrology of the upper Siem Reap River. The objective was to reconstruct patterns of annual deforestation from 1988 to 2018 and to explore scenarios of land use 40 and 80 years into the future. A supervised maximum likelihood classification was applied to investigate forest cover change in the last three decades. Multi-layer perceptron neural network-Markov chain (MLPNN-MC) was used to forecast land use and land cover (LULC) change for the years 2058 and 2098. The results show that there has been a significantly decreasing trend in forest cover at the rate 1.22% over the last three decades, and there would be a continuous upward trend of deforestation and downward trend of forest cover in the future.

Medium- and long-rage forecasts of Nile flows at Aswan have been recognized as of significant importance to allow better management and operation of the water resource facilities and mitigate the risks of both droughts and floods. In this study, a wide range of climate indices and atmospheric fields were used as potential predictors for long-range forecasting of Nile streamflow for one flood season ahead (July-October). The approach followed in this study focuses on searching for potential predictors, reducing the pool of potential predictors by using multivariate statistical analysis, applying sequentially, Canonical Correlation Analysis, Principal Component Analysis, and multiple linear regression to robustly forecast the Nile flow. The proposed approach proved to be very useful for improving long-range Nile River flow forecasting.

51,Enhancing the Predictability of Seasonal Streamflow With a Statistical-Dynamical Approach,"Seasonal streamflow forecasts facilitate water allocation, reservoir operation, flood risk management, and crop forecasting. They are generally computed by forcing hydrological models with outputs from general circulation models (GCMs) or using large-scale climate indices as predictors in statistical models. In contrast, hybrid statistical-dynamical forecasts (combining statistical methods with dynamical climate predictions) are still uncommon, and their skill is largely unknown. Here we conduct systematic forecasting of seasonal streamflow using eight GCMs from the North American Multi-Model Ensemble, 0.5-9.5 months ahead, at 290 stream gauges in the U.S. Midwest. Probabilistic forecasts are developed for low to high streamflow using predictors that reflect climatic and anthropogenic influences. Results indicate that GCM forecasts of climate and antecedent climatic conditions enhance seasonal streamflow predictability; while land cover and population density predictors decrease biases or enhance skill in certain catchments. This paper paves the way for novel forecasting approaches using dynamical GCM predictions within statistical frameworks. Plain Language Summary Streamflow forecasts several months ahead of a season are important for water management and the prevention of risks related to floods and hydrological droughts. However, existing methods for producing seasonal streamflow forecasts are often complex and computationally intensive. Here we provide a systematic evaluation of a statistical-dynamical approach to streamflow forecasting in several hundred river catchments across the U.S. Midwest. We assess whether global climate model forecasts can be used as predictors in statistical models to produce skillful forecasts of river flow, up to 10 months ahead. Results indicate that forecasts of rainfall and temperature, antecedent climatic conditions, as well as information on population density and land cover, can be used effectively to forecast streamflow at seasonal time scales. By including information on the future antecedent climatic conditions, streamflow forecasts can be enhanced months ahead. Information on human influences, in contrast, helps reduce the biases in the streamflow forecasts. These results pave the way for statistical-dynamical forecasting in catchments around the world and suggest that process-driven combinations of different predictors can be used to produce skillful streamflow forecasts in different seasons, for both high flows (i.e., floods) and low flows (i.e., representative of hydrological droughts).",https://doi.org/10.1029/2018GL077945,10.1029/2018GL077945,"Slater, Louise J.; Villarini, Gabriele",GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH LETTERS,streamflow; forecast; NMME; precipitation; temperature; land cover,CENTRAL UNITED-STATES; PREDICTION SYSTEM; FORECASTS; CLIMATE; SCALE; MODELS; SKILL,,AMER GEOPHYSICAL UNION,WASHINGTON,"2000 FLORIDA AVE NW, WASHINGTON, DC 20009 USA",0094-8276,1944-8007,,GEOPHYS RES LETT,Geophys.

The feature selection methods in the current hydrology research community are not able to handle the problem in such basins. The paper proposes a novel feature selection algorithm-Bubble Selection-based on the idea of utilizing geographic distance as a metric. Evaluation of the performance of the algorithm is carried out by applying the Bubble Selection, to the case study of modeling Austria's water resources of 540 stations in a single run mode. The aim is to select features for each station among 2412 stations, streamflow, precipitation, snow, snow depth, and water level measurements are available. The proposed algorithm allows considerably reducing the dimension of features. The Bubble Selection algorithm is further combined with the Sequential Forward Selection algorithm. Performance of the hybrid model is compared with the performance of Feature Ranking method in terms of the coefficient of determination, Nash-Sutcliffe Efficiency, and percent bias. The results show the superiority of the proposed hybrid algorithm over the Feature Ranking.

53,"Early Warning and Forecasting System of Water Quality Safety for Drinking Water Source Areas in Three Gorges Reservoir Area, China","Nowadays, the effects of water pollution accidents on water quality safety and regional residents' living have attracted worldwide attention. Therefore, the objective of this research is to propose an early warning and forecasting model and develop a visual system of water quality safety for drinking water source areas in the Three Gorges Reservoir Area under accident conditions. Based on an Instantaneous Point Source Two-dimensional Water Quality Model and the security requirements of water quality, an early warning and forecasting model was presented, and then the system was advanced by a MATLAB platform. In addition, a hypothetical case was also carried out for the Fenghuangshan drinking water source area. Within 0.040 h to 0.096 h after the accident, the water quality could meet the standard, and the warning level was primary and intermediate, sequentially. From 0.096 h to 11.960 h after the accident, the pollutant concentration exceeded the standard, under which conditions advanced warning started. Then the intermediate and primary warnings restarted in sequence until the pollutant concentration decreased to the background value.

54,Incorporating Streamflow Forecasts with Aggregate Drought Indices for the Management of Water Supply,"Streamflow forecasts and common drought indicators were evaluated for suitability to inform drought mitigation actions for the city of Baltimore's water supply system. Preliminary streamflow forecasts developed by the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration's Mid-Atlantic River Forecast Center (MARFC) were incorporated with other key drought indices, including the standardized precipitation index, days of storage remaining (DSR) index, and Palmer drought severity index in an aggregate drought index to classify drought severity and to trigger drought mitigation actions. Aggregate drought indices were evaluated in the drought action response tool, a simulation model created for this research. Results show that the combined forecast and drought indicators improve water supply operations, allowing the Baltimore system to maintain reliable supply and preserve storage throughout periods of drought. The DSR metric constructed from MARFC forecasts is recommended for incorporation into the city of Baltimore's drought management plan to facilitate proactive drought response.",https://doi.org/10.1061/(ASCE)WR.1943-5452.0000849,10.1061/(ASCE)WR.1943-5452.0000849,"Booras, Kathryn; McIntyre, Alexandra R.; Weiss, W.

55,New formulation for forecasting streamflow: evolutionary polynomial regression vs. extreme learning machine,"Streamflow forecasting is crucial in hydrology and hydraulic engineering since it is capable of optimizing water resource systems or planning future expansion. This study investigated the performances of three different soft computing methods, multilayer perceptron neural network (MLPNN), optimally pruned extreme learning machine (OP-ELM), and evolutionary polynomial regression (EPR) in forecasting daily streamflow. Data from three different stations, Soleyman Tange, Perorich Abad, and Ali Abad located on the Tajan River of Iran were used to estimate the daily streamflow. MLPNN model was employed to determine the optimal input combinations of each station implementing evaluation criteria. In both training and testing stages in the three stations, the results of comparison indicated that the EPR technique would generally perform more efficiently than MLPNN and OP-ELM models. EPR model represented the best performance to simulate the peak flow compared to MLPNN and OP-ELM models while the MLPNN provided significantly under/overestimations. EPR models which include explicit mathematical formulations are recommended for daily streamflow forecasting which is necessary in watershed hydrology management.",https://doi.org/10.2166/nh.2017.283,10.2166/nh.2017.283,"Rezaie-Balf, Mohammad; Kisi, Ozgur",HYDROLOGY RESEARCH,evolutionary polynomial regression; optimally pruned extreme learning machine; river flow forecasting; Tajan catchment,SUPPORT VECTOR MACHINE; HIMALAYAN MICRO-WATERSHEDS; ARTIFICIAL NEURAL-NETWORKS; PREDICTION; RUNOFF; SCOUR; PERFORMANCE; SPLINES; MODELS; EPR,,IWA PUBLISHING,LONDON,"REPUBLIC-EXPORT BLDG, UNITS 1 04 & 1 05, 1 CLOVE CRESCENT, LONDON, ENGLAND",1998-9563,2224-7955,,HYDROL RES,Hydrol.

56,Assimilation of Ground and Satellite Snow Observations in a Distributed Hydrologic Model for Water Supply Forecasting,"Runoff from the Upper Colorado River Basin (UCRB) is an important water resource in the western United States. The majority of annual runoff is derived from spring snowmelt, and therefore April-July water supply volume (WSV) forecasts produced by the Colorado Basin River Forecast Center are critical to basin water management. The primary objective of this study was to evaluate the impact of snow data assimilation (DA) in a distributed hydrologic model on WSV forecasting error and skill in headwater catchments of the UCRB. To do this, a framework was built to use the Localized Ensemble transform Kalman filter to update modeled snow water equivalent (SWE) states in the Hydrology Laboratory-Research Distributed Hydrologic Model with SNOTEL SWE observations and spatially and temporally complete MODIS Snow Covered-Area and Grain size data. The DA approach was assessed by evaluating ensemble streamflow prediction forecasts over a 20-year period for 23 catchments in the UCRB. Overall, the DA approach improved water supply forecast skill in 80% of pilot basins with an average improvement in the median continuous rank probability skill score of 4%. A research-to-operations transition was facilitated by automating the implementation of the DA approach. This work demonstrates the capacity for gridded and point snow products to be used to objectively update model states in an operational forecasting setting.",https://doi.org/10.1111/1752-1688.12975,10.1111/1752-1688.12975,"Micheletty, P.; Perrot, D.; Day, G.; Rittger, K.",JOURNAL OF THE AMERICAN WATER RESOURCES ASSOCIATION,streamflow; snow hydrology; surface water hydrology; planning; water supply,ENSEMBLE KALMAN FILTER; COLORADO RIVER; SWE DATA; STREAMFLOW; COVER; EQUIVALENT; RUNOFF; MODIS; PRECIPITATION; PREDICTION,,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",1093-474X,1752-1688,,J AM WATER RESOUR AS,J.

57,AI-based techniques for multi-step streamflow forecasts: application for multi-objective reservoir operation optimization and performance assessment,"Streamflow forecasts are traditionally effective in mitigating water scarcity and flood defense. This study developed an artificial intelligence (AI)-based management methodology that integrated multi-step streamflow forecasts and multi-objective reservoir operation optimization for water resource allocation. Following the methodology, we aimed to assess forecast quality and forecast-informed reservoir operation performance together due to the influence of inflow forecast uncertainty. Varying combinations of climate and hydrological variables were input into three AI-based models, namely a long short-term memory (LSTM), a gated recurrent unit (GRU), and a least-squares support vector machine (LSSVM), to forecast short-term streamflow. Based on three deterministic forecasts, the stochastic inflow scenarios were further developed using Bayesian model averaging (BMA) for quantifying uncertainty. The forecasting scheme was further coupled with a multi-reservoir optimization model, and the multi-objective programming was solved using the parameterized multi-objective robust decision-making (MORDM) approach. The AI-based management framework was applied and demonstrated over a multi-reservoir system (25 reservoirs) in the Zhoushan Islands, China. Three main conclusions were drawn from this study: (1) GRU and LSTM performed equally well on streamflow forecasts, and GRU might be the preferred method over LSTM, given that it had simpler structures and less modeling time; (2) higher forecast performance could lead to improved reservoir operation, while uncertain forecasts were more valuable than deterministic forecasts, regarding two performance metrics, i.e., water supply reliability and operating costs; (3) the relationship between the forecast horizon and reservoir operation was complex and depended on the operating configurations (forecast quality and uncertainty) and performance measures. This study reinforces the potential of an AI-based stochastic streamflow forecasting scheme to seek robust strategies under uncertainty.",https://doi.org/10.5194/hess-25-5951-2021,10.5194/hess-25-5951-2021,"Guo, Yuxue; Yu, Xinting; Xu, Yue-Ping; Chen, Hao; Gu, Haiting; Xie, Jingkai",HYDROLOGY AND EARTH SYSTEM SCIENCES,,ROBUST DECISION-MAKING; SHORT-TERM-MEMORY; ENSEMBLE MODEL; RIVER-BASIN; WATER; MANAGEMENT; UNCERTAINTY; RESOURCES; SKILL; PREDICTION,,COPERNICUS GESELLSCHAFT MBH,GOTTINGEN,"BAHNHOFSALLEE 1E, GOTTINGEN, 37081, GERMANY",1027-5606,1607-7938,,HYDROL EARTH SYST SC,Hydrol.

58,Forecasting Daily Streamflow for Basins with Different Physical Characteristics through Data-Driven Methods,"Modelling streamflow is essential for activities, such as flood control, drought mitigation, and water resources utilization and management. Artificial neural network (ANN), adaptive neuro-fuzzy inference system (ANFIS), and support vector machines (SVM) are techniques that are frequently used in hydrology to specifically model streamflow. This study compares the accuracy of ANN, ANFIS, and SVM in forecasting the daily streamflow with the traditional approach known as autoregressive (AR) model for basins with different physical characteristics. The accuracies of the models are compared for three basins, that is, 1801, 1805, and 1822, at the Seyhan River Basin in Turkey. The comparison was performed by using coefficient of efficiency, index of agreement, and root-mean-square error. Results indicate that ANN and ANFIS are more accurate than AR and SVM for all the basins. ANN and ANFIS perform similarly, while ANN outperformed ANFIS. Among the models used, the ANN demonstrates the highest performance in forecasting the peak flood values. This study also finds that physical characteristics, such as small area, high slope, and high elevation variation, and streamflow variance deteriorate the accuracy of the methods.",https://doi.org/10.1007/s11269-018-1998-1,10.1007/s11269-018-1998-1,"Hadi, Sinan Jasim; Tombul, Mustafa",WATER RESOURCES MANAGEMENT,Artificial neural network; Adaptive neuro-fuzzy inference system; Support vector machines; Autoregression; Streamflow,ARTIFICIAL NEURAL-NETWORK; RIVER FLOW; PREDICTION; MODELS,,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0920-4741,1573-1650,,WATER RESOUR MANAG,Water Resour.

59,Development of an accurate model to predict the phenology of Atlantic salmon smolt spring migration,"Changes in migration timing, resulting from the alteration in river continuity or the effect of climate change, can have major consequences on the population dynamics of diadromous fish. Forecasting the phenology of fish migration is thus critically important to implement management actions aimed at protecting fish during their migration. In this study, an 11-year monitoring survey of Atlantic salmon smolts (Salmo salar) from the Ourthe River, Belgium, was analysed within a European Special Area of Conservation to improve the understanding of environment-induced spring migration. A logistic model was fitted to forecast smolt migration and to calculate phenological indicators for management, i.e. the onset, end, and duration of migration, while accounting for the influence of photoperiod, water temperature, and hydrological conditions. The results indicated that the photo-thermal units accumulated by smolts above a 7 degrees C temperature threshold was a relevant proxy to reflect the synergistic effect between temperature and photoperiod on smolt migration. After integrating the effect of river flow pulses, the model accurately explained the inter-annual changes in migration timing (R-2= 0.95). The model predictions provide decisive management information to identify sensitive periods during which mitigation measures (e.g. hydropower turbine shutdown, river discharge management) should be conducted to promote smolt survival. The model was used to predict phenological characteristics under future scenarios of climate change. The results suggest a joint effect of hydrological alterations and water warming. Temperature increases of 1-4 degrees C were associated with earlier initiation of migration, 6-51 days earlier, and spring flood events greatly influenced the duration of the migration period. Accordingly, the combined effects of human-induced modifications of the hydrological regimes and increasing temperatures could result in a mismatch between the smolt and favourable survival conditions in the marine environment.",https://doi.org/10.1002/aqc.3382,10.1002/aqc.3382,"Teichert, Nils; Benitez, Jean-Philippe; Dierckx, Arnaud; Tetard, Stephane; de Oliveira, Eric; Trancart, Thomas; Feunteun, Eric; Ovidio, Michael",AQUATIC CONSERVATION-MARINE AND FRESHWATER ECOSYSTEMS,climate change; disturbance; engineering; fish; hydroecology; hydropower; migration; river,AUTUMN DOWNSTREAM MIGRATION; FRESH-WATER; SEAWARD MIGRATION; GROWTH-HORMONE; SALAR L.; TEMPERATURE; BEHAVIOR; SURVIVAL; PARR; PHOTOPERIOD,,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",1052-7613,1099-0755,,AQUAT CONSERV,Aquat.

60,"An Ensemble Modeling Approach to Forecast Daily Reservoir Inflow Using Bidirectional Long- and Short-Term Memory (Bi-LSTM), Variational Mode Decomposition (VMD), and Energy Entropy Method","Daily inflow forecasts provide important decision support for the operations and management of reservoirs. Accurate and reliable forecasting plays an important role in the optimal management of water resources. Numerous studies have shown that decomposition integration models have good prediction capacity. Considering the nonlinearity and unsteady state of daily incoming flow data, a hybrid model of adaptive variational mode decomposition (VMD) and bidirectional long- and short-term memory (Bi-LSTM) based on energy entropy was developed for daily inflow forecast. The model was analyzed using the mean absolute error (MAE), the root means square error (RMSE), Nash-Sutcliffe efficiency coefficient (NSE), and correlation coefficient (r). A historical daily inflow series of the Baozhusi Hydropower Station, China, is investigated by the proposed VMD-BiLSTM with hybrid models. For comparison, BP, GRNN, ELMAN, SVR, LSTM, Bi-LSTM, EMD-LSTM, and VMD-LSTM, were adopted and analyzed for evaluation and analyzed. We found that the proposed model, with MAE = 38.965, RMSE = 64.783, and NSE = 95.7%, was superior to the other models. Therefore, the hybrid model is robust and efficient for forecasting highly nonstationary and nonlinear streamflow. It can be used as the preferred data-driven tool to predict the daily inflow flow, which can ensure the safe operation of hydropower stations in reservoirs. As an interdisciplinary field spanning both machine learning and hydrology, daily inflow forecasting can become an important breakthrough in the application of deep learning to hydrology.",https://doi.org/10.1007/s11269-021-02879-3,10.1007/s11269-021-02879-3,"Li, Fugang; Ma, Guangwen; Chen, Shijun; Huang, Weibin",WATER RESOURCES MANAGEMENT,Daily inflow forecasting; Deep learning; Energy entropy; Variational mode decomposition; K-mean; Bi-directional long- and short-term memory (Bi-LSTM),NEURAL-NETWORK; ALGORITHM; RUNOFF; STREAMFLOW,,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0920-4741,1573-1650,,WATER RESOUR MANAG,Water Resour.

61,Shift Detection in Hydrological Regimes and Pluriannual Low-Frequency Streamflow Forecasting Using the Hidden Markov Model,"Improved water resource management relies on accurate analyses of the past dynamics of hydrological variables. The presence of low-frequency structures in hydrologic time series is an important feature. It can modify the probability of extreme events occurring in different time scales, which makes the risk associated with extreme events dynamic, changing from one decade to another. This article proposes a methodology capable of dynamically detecting and predicting low-frequency streamflow (16-32 years), which presented significance in the wavelet power spectrum. The Standardized Runoff Index (SRI), the Pruned Exact Linear Time (PELT) algorithm, the breaks for additive seasonal and trend (BFAST) method, and the hidden Markov model (HMM) were used to identify the shifts in low frequency. The HMM was also used to forecast the low frequency. As part of the results, the regime shifts detected by the BFAST approach are not entirely consistent with results from the other methods. A common shift occurs in the mid-1980s and can be attributed to the construction of the reservoir. Climate variability modulates the streamflow low-frequency variability, and anthropogenic activities and climate change can modify this modulation. The identification of shifts reveals the impact of low frequency in the streamflow time series, showing that the low-frequency variability conditions the flows of a given year.",https://doi.org/10.3390/w12072058,10.3390/w12072058,"Rafael Rolim, Larissa Zaira; de Souza Filho, Francisco de Assis",WATER,streamflow; low-frequency variability; regime shift; hydrological prediction; Sobradinho dam,CLIMATE-CHANGE; TRENDS; RIVER; RAINFALL; BRAZIL; PRECIPITATION; VARIABILITY; COMPUTATION; TUTORIAL; RUNOFF,,MDPI,BASEL,"ST ALBAN-ANLAGE 66, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND",,2073-4441,,WATER-SUI,Water,JUL,2020,12,7,,,2058,

The investigation is based on hydrological modelling and is conducted through the case study of the Upper Hanjiang River Basin (UHRB). A semi-distributed hydrological model, TsingHua Representative Elementary Watershed (THREW), is implemented to simulate the rainfall-runoff processes, with the help of hydrological ensemble prediction system (HEPS) approach. A post-processing method, quantile mapping method, is applied to bias correct the raw precipitation forecasts. Then we evaluate the performance of raw and post-processed streamflow forecasts for the four hydrological stations along the mainstream of Hanjiang River from 2001 to 2008. The results show that the performance of the streamflow forecasts is greatly enhanced with post-processing precipitation forecasts, especially in pre-dry season (November and December), thus providing useful information for water supply management of the central route of South to North Water Diversion Project (SNWDP). The raw streamflow forecasts tend to overpredict and present similarly to forecast accuracy with the extended streamflow prediction (ESP) approach.

63,Variance decomposition of forecasted sediment transport in a lowland watershed using global climate model ensembles,"Forecasting change in sediment transport using global climate model ensembles is under-developed in the hydrology community due to a lack of knowledge regarding the variance structure of predictions. We investigate the uncertainty of forecast sediment transport from sources, including global climate model realizations, global climate model ensemble design, forecasted hydrologic inputs, and hydrologic modeling parameterization. We then forecast sediment transport for the gently rolling watershed in Kentucky, USA. Contrary to past research forecasting hydrology with global climate models, hydrologic model parameterization was the most significant source of variance impacting forecasted sediment transport variables. Forecast of sediment transport responses shows the propagation of uncertainty from the hydrologic model parameterization was over two times greater than the uncertainty from the selected global climate model realizations. This result emphasizes researchers focused on forecasting sediment transport with global climate models may need to give as much, or more, consideration to their water-sediment linkages as climate-water-sediment linkages. Hydrologic inputs from climate change, including forecast precipitation, temperature, relative humidity, solar radiation, and wind speed, impacted sediment transport. Considering changes in precipitation and temperature alone under-predicts streamflow and sediment transport by 49% and 35%, respectively, compared to including all meteorological variables inputs. Variance introduced across the three different global climate model ensembles was a relatively small source of variance impacting forecasted streamflow or sediment yield. The results suggest a quantitative effort by the researcher to design the global climate model ensemble by considering representativeness, historical performance, and independency will lead to robust results. Ensemble average forecasts forecast streamflow and sediment yield to increase by 19% and 14%, respectively, for the lowland watershed. The sediment transport forecasts reflect the shear-limited landscape of the watershed and the transport-limited conditions in the stream channel.",https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jhydrol.2021.126760,10.1016/j.jhydrol.2021.126760,"Al Aamery, Nabil; Fox, James F.; Mahoney, Tyler",JOURNAL OF HYDROLOGY,Sediment transport; Climate change; Streamflow; Propagation of uncertainty,DOWNSCALING METHODS; SCENARIO SELECTION; BIAS CORRECTION; CHANGE IMPACTS; RIVER-BASIN; STREAMFLOW; UNCERTAINTY; HYDROLOGY; (DIS)CONNECTIVITY; PRECIPITATION,,ELSEVIER,AMSTERDAM,"RADARWEG 29, 1043 NX AMSTERDAM, NETHERLANDS",0022-1694,1879-2707,,J HYDROL,J.

64,Evaluating the performances of several artificial intelligence methods in forecasting daily streamflow time series for sustainable water resources management,"Accurate runoff forecasting plays an important role in guaranteeing the sustainable utilization and management of water resources. Artificial intelligence methods can provide new possibilities for runoff prediction when the underlying physical relationship cannot be explicitly obtained. However, few reports evaluate the performances of various artificial intelligence methods in forecasting daily streamflow time series for sustainable water resources management by far. To refill this research gap, the potentials of five artificial intelligence methods in daily streamflow series prediction are examined, including artificial neural network (ANN), adaptive neural based fuzzy inference system (ANFIS), extreme learning machine (ELM), Gaussian process regression (GPR) and support vector machine (SVM). Four quantitative statistical indexes are chosen as the evaluation benchmarks. The results from two huge hydropower reservoirs in China show that five artificial intelligence methods can achieve satisfying forecasting results, while the SVM, GPR and ELM methods can produce better performances than ANN and ANFIS in both training and testing phases with respective to four indexes. Thus, it is of great importance to carefully choose the appropriate forecasting models based on the actual characteristics of the studied reservoir.",https://doi.org/10.1016/j.scs.2020.102562,10.1016/j.scs.2020.102562,"Niu, Wen-jing; Feng, Zhong-kai",SUSTAINABLE CITIES AND SOCIETY,Runoff time series prediction; Artificial neural network; Adaptive neural-based fuzzy inference system; Extreme learning machine; Support vector machine; Gaussian process regression,,,ELSEVIER,AMSTERDAM,"RADARWEG 29, 1043 NX AMSTERDAM, NETHERLANDS",2210-6707,2210-6715,,SUSTAIN CITIES SOC,Sust.

Aiming at the problem of water quality prediction in reservoirs, a CA-NARX algorithm is designed, which combines the improved dynamic clustering algorithm with the idea of machine learning and the forward dynamic regression neural network. The improved dynamic clustering algorithm is used to classify the eutrophication degree of waterbodies according to the total phosphorus and total nitrogen content. Considering four meteorological factors, air temperature, water temperature, water surface evaporation, and rainfall, synthetically for each water quality condition, the total phosphorus and total nitrogen in the waterbody are forecasted by an improved forward NARX dynamic regression neural network. Based on this, the CA-NARX prediction algorithm can realize short period water quality prediction.

66,Evaluation of GloFAS-Seasonal Forecasts for Cascade Reservoir Impoundment Operation in the Upper Yangtze River,"Standard impoundment operation rules (SIOR) are pre-defined guidelines for refilling reservoirs before the end of the wet season. The advancement and availability of the seasonal flow forecasts provide the opportunity for reservoir operators to use flexible and early impoundment operation rules (EIOR). These flexible impoundment rules can significantly improve water conservation, particularly during dry years. In this study, we investigate the potential application of seasonal streamflow forecasts for employing EIOR in the upper Yangtze River basin. We first define thresholds to determine the streamflow condition in September, which is an important period for decision-making in the basin, and then select the most suitable impoundment operation rules accordingly. The thresholds are used in a simulation-optimization model to evaluate different scenarios for EIOR and SIOR by multiple objectives. We measure the skill of the GloFAS-Seasonal forecast, an operational global seasonal river flow forecasting system, to predict streamflow condition according to the selected thresholds. The results show that: (1) the 20th and 30th percentiles of the historical September flow are suitable thresholds for evaluating the possibility of employing EIOR; (2) compared to climatological forecasts, GloFAS-Seasonal forecasts are skillful for predicting the streamflow condition according to the selected 20th and 30th percentile thresholds; and (3) during dry years, EIOR could improve the fullness storage rate by 5.63% and the annual average hydropower generation by 4.02%, without increasing the risk of flooding.

67,Inferred inflow forecast horizons guiding reservoir release decisions across the United States,"Medium- to long-range forecasts often guide reservoir release decisions to support water management objectives, including mitigating flood and drought risks. While there is a burgeoning field of science targeted at improving forecast products and associated decision support models, data describing how and when forecasts are applied in practice remain undeveloped. This lack of knowledge may prevent hydrological modelers from developing accurate reservoir release schemes for large-scale, distributed hydrology models that are increasingly used to assess the vulnerabilities of large regions to hydrological stress. We address this issue by estimating seasonally varying, regulated inflow forecast horizons used in the operations of more than 300 dams throughout the conterminous United States (CONUS). For each dam, we take actual forward observed inflows (perfect foresight) as a proxy for forecasted flows available to the operator and then identify for each week of the year the forward horizon that best explains the release decisions taken. Resulting horizon curves specify for each dam the inferred inflow forecast horizon as a function of the week of the water year. These curves are analyzed for strength of evidence for contribution of medium- to long-range forecasts in decision making. We use random forest classification to estimate that approximately 80% of large dams and reservoirs in the US (1553 +/- 50 out of 1927 dams with at least 10 Mm(3) storage capacity) adopt medium- to long-range inflow forecasts to inform release decisions during at least part of the water year. Long-range forecast horizons (more than 6 weeks ahead) are detected in the operations of reservoirs located in high-elevation regions of the western US, where snowpack information likely guides the release. A simulation exercise conducted on four key western US reservoirs indicates that forecast-informed models of reservoir operations may outperform models that neglect the horizon curve - including during flood and drought conditions.",https://doi.org/10.5194/hess-24-1275-2020,10.5194/hess-24-1275-2020,"Turner, Sean W.

68,Prediction of algal bloom occurrence based on the naive Bayesian model considering satellite image pixel differences,"Bloom occurrence probability prediction is a critical issue for freshwater resource management and protection. As the mechanism of algal blooms is not understood, the construction of prediction model mainly depends on statistical data. Therefore, knowledge on prior bloom occurrence derived from statistical data plays a significant role in establishing a prediction model. In this study, a naive Bayesian model incorporating prior information was constructed to predict algal bloom occurrence probabilities 1-7 days in advance under different weather conditions in Dianchi Lake. The proposed model utilised the following data from the MODIS images, the floating algae index (FAI) for the previous 7 days and five meteorological variables (mean wind speed, air pressure, relative humidity on the prediction day, accumulated sunshine hours in the previous 3 days, and accumulated air temperature in the previous 7 days). The prior probabilities of each pixel were calculated on a monthly timescale to highlight the bloom's temporal-spatial differences, and the 1-7 day posterior probabilities were calculated by combining the prior and conditional probabilities.

Additionally, the independent validation datasets showed that the percentage of correctly classified instances (CCI%) of approximately 90% of the pixels were greater than 50%.

69,Two-Phase Risk Hedging Rules for Informing Conservation of Flood Resources in Reservoir Operation Considering Inflow Forecast Uncertainty,"Water shortages during dry periods can be successfully mitigated by managing reservoirs in real-time to conserve water as floods recede. The inherent uncertainty in inflow forecasts however means that it remains a challenge to balance the risks of flooding against those of water shortages. Few studies have examined how the risks of floods and water shortages can be managed using reservoir operation rules. In this study, a two-phase stochastic optimization model was built to determine the optimal conservation level for flood water by minimizing the risks from both floods and water shortages. For the optimal condition, hedging rules were analytically derived as a quasi-linear function of the storage capability and the expected water shortage. The rules indicate that the flood water conservation was achieved when the marginal upstream flood risk was equal to the marginal water shortage risk, and that the limits of three operation zones divided by the expected water availability should be used when determining the water release. The results from testing the model with data from the Xianghongdian Reservoir (China) showed that the hedging rules outperformed the capacity-constrained pre-release rules for conserving flood water without increasing the flood risk. This proposed methodology will inform the process for making decisions about how to operate reservoirs to ensure optimal real-time flood water conservation.",https://doi.org/10.1007/s11269-020-02571-y,10.1007/s11269-020-02571-y,"Xu, Bin; Huang, Xin; Zhong, Ping-an; Wu, Yenan",WATER RESOURCES MANAGEMENT,Reservoir operation; Flood water conservation; Hedging rules; Risky decision-making; First-order optimality condition,,,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0920-4741,1573-1650,,WATER RESOUR MANAG,Water Resour.

70,"Future projections of water level and thermal regime changes of a multipurpose subtropical reservoir (Sao Paulo, Brazil)","The increase in global air temperatures as well as variability in rainfall shifts due to climate change has been affecting the dynamics of water level fluctuations and thermal regimes in lakes and reservoirs. It is expected that at the end of this decade, such impacts will be even more noticeable and may harm the inland waters use. However, little is known about the possible consequences of climate change in multipurpose subtropical reservoirs. Using data generated by a regionalized climate model (RCM) as input to a simple hydrological model and a one-dimensional vertical hydrodynamic model, we forecast potential changes in the Itupararanga reservoir, Sao Paulo, Brazil, in an exemplary time period (2028-2030) in the next decade. Two Representative Concentration Pathway (RCP) scenarios were considered: an optimistic one corresponding to a CO2 increase of about 650 ppm (RCP 4.5) and a pessimistic scenario where CO2 exceeds 1000 ppm in 2100 (RCP 8.5). We found a significant reduction in the reservoir water level for both scenarios of 35% compared to current conditions. The surface water temperature is expected to increase (+0.6 degrees C); on the other hand, there would be a cooling of the hypolimnion (RCP 4.5=-0.3 degrees C; RCP 8.5=-1.2 degrees C). Another consequence is an increase of the duration of stratification periods that would start earlier in the dry period (between July and August), as well as the intensification of the stability of the water column (+43% compared to current conditions) and a deepening of the thermocline. The hydrodynamic modeling results suggest that the water level drop may threaten the reservoir multiple uses, in particular drinking water supply and power generation. Furthermore, the heating of surface water layers and increase of the number of stratified days and thermal stability can have negative impacts on water quality. (C) 2021 Elsevier B.V.

71,Understanding and seasonal forecasting of hydrological drought in the Anthropocene,"Hydrological drought is not only caused by natural hydroclimate variability but can also be directly altered by human interventions including reservoir operation, irrigation, groundwater exploitation, etc. Understanding and forecasting of hydrological drought in the Anthropocene are grand challenges due to complicated interactions among climate, hydrology and humans. In this paper, five decades (1961-2010) of naturalized and observed streamflow datasets are used to investigate hydrological drought characteristics in a heavily managed river basin, the Yellow River basin in north China. Human interventions decrease the correlation between hydrological and meteorological droughts, and make the hydrological drought respond to longer time-scales of meteorological drought. Due to large water consumptions in the middle and lower reaches, there are 118-262% increases in the hydrological drought frequency, up to 8-fold increases in the drought severity, 21-99% increases in the drought duration and the drought onset is earlier. The non-stationarity due to anthropogenic climate change and human water use basically decreases the correlation between meteorological and hydrological droughts and reduces the effect of human interventions on hydrological drought frequency while increasing the effect on drought duration and severity. A set of 29-year (1982-2010) hindcasts from an established seasonal hydrological forecasting system are used to assess the forecast skill of hydrological drought. In the naturalized condition, the climate-model-based approach outperforms the climatology method in predicting the 2001 severe hydrological drought event. Based on the 29-year hindcasts, the former method has a Brier skill score of 11-26% against the latter for the probabilistic hydrological drought forecasting. In the Anthropocene, the skill for both approaches increases due to the dominant influence of human interventions that have been implicitly incorporated by the hydrological postprocessing, while the difference between the two predictions decreases. This suggests that human interventions can outweigh the climate variability for the hydrological drought forecasting in the Anthropocene, and the predictability for human interventions needs more attention.",https://doi.org/10.5194/hess-21-5477-2017,10.5194/hess-21-5477-2017,"Yuan, Xing; Zhang, Miao; Wang, Linying; Zhou, Tian",HYDROLOGY AND EARTH SYSTEM SCIENCES,,STANDARDIZED PRECIPITATION INDEX; YELLOW-RIVER BASIN; SOIL-MOISTURE; WATER-RESOURCES; CLIMATE-CHANGE; SURFACE-WATER; STREAMFLOW; PREDICTION; SYSTEM; SKILL,,COPERNICUS GESELLSCHAFT MBH,GOTTINGEN,"BAHNHOFSALLEE 1E, GOTTINGEN, 37081, GERMANY",1027-5606,1607-7938,,HYDROL EARTH SYST SC,Hydrol.

73,Real-time reservoir operation using recurrent neural networks and inflow forecast from a distributed hydrological model,"Large-scale reservoirs play an essential role in water resources management for agriculture irrigation, water supply and flood controls. However, we need robust reservoir operation systems under both normal flow and extreme flow conditions. In this study, we applied recurrent neural networks (RNN) to simulate the operation of three multi-purpose reservoirs located in the upper Chao Phraya River basin. Two reservoirs have the function of multiannual flow regulation and one has the function of incomplete annual regulation. The goal of this study is to explore the applicability of RNN models for operation of reservoirs with multiannual flow regulation under different flow regimes, especially under extreme floods and droughts. We used three RNNs, namely nonlinear autoregressive models with exogenous input (NARX), long short-term memory (LSTM) and genetic algorithm based NAXR (GA-NAXR) for reservoir operation based on historical data. For real-time water resources management, an accurate inflow forecast is required to provide a real-time reservoir outflow, and thus we also carried out a real-time reservoir operation using the RNN and the inflow forecast by a distributed hydrological model. Results show that (1) GA-NARX has the highest accuracy among three RNNs and is more stable than the original NARX by optimizing the initial conditions, although it takes longer training time than NARX and LSTM; (2) GA-NARX-based operation model is effective under extreme floods and droughts; and (3) the real-time operation system combining the GA-NARX and the distributed hydrological model has reasonable accuracy in both wet season and dry season. RNN-based operation model developed in this study has potential applicability in practical water management, and the model combining the hydrological prediction is specially useful for real-time reservoir operation.",https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jhydrol.2019.124229,10.1016/j.jhydrol.2019.124229,"Yang, Shuyu; Yang, Dawen; Chen, Jinsong; Zhao, Baoxu",JOURNAL OF HYDROLOGY,Recurrent neural networks; Real-time reservoir operation; Inflow forecast by distributed hydrological model; The upper Chao Phraya River basin,SUPPORT VECTOR MACHINE; PHRAYA RIVER-BASIN; GENETIC ALGORITHM; SHORT-TERM; GLOBAL OPTIMIZATION; SERIES PREDICTION; CLIMATE; SYSTEM; FLOOD; INTEGRATION,,ELSEVIER,AMSTERDAM,"RADARWEG 29, 1043 NX AMSTERDAM, NETHERLANDS",0022-1694,1879-2707,,J HYDROL,J.

74,"Use of Seasonal Streamflow Forecasts for Flood Mitigation with Adaptive Reservoir Operation: A Case Study of the Chao Phraya River Basin, Thailand, in 2011","Predicting streamflow can help water managers make policy decisions for individual river basins. In 2011, heavy rainfall from May until October resulted in the largest flood event in the history of Thailand. This event created difficulty for water managers, who lacked information to make predictions. Studies on the 2011 Thai flood have proposed alternative reservoir operations for flood mitigation. However, no study to date has used predictive information to determine how to control reservoirs and mitigate such extreme floods. Thus, the objective of this study is to update and develop a method for using streamflow predictive data to support adaptive reservoir operation with the aim of mitigating the 2011 flood. The study area was the Chao Phraya River Basin, one of the most important basins in Thailand. We obtained predictive information from a hydrological model with a reservoir operation module using an ensemble of seasonal precipitation data from the European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts (ECMWF). The six-month ECMWF prediction period was used to support the operation plan for mitigating flooding in 2011 around each reservoir during the wet season. Decision-making for reservoir operation based on seasonal predictions was conducted on a monthly time scale. The results showed that peak river discharge decreased slightly, by around 4%, when seasonal predictive data were used. Moreover, changing the reservoir operation plan and using seasonal predictions decreased the peak river discharge by around 20%.",https://doi.org/10.3390/w12113210,10.3390/w12113210,"Kompor, Wongnarin; Yoshikawa, Sayaka; Kanae, Shinjiro",WATER,adaptive reservoir operation; ECMWF predictive data; H08 model; reservoir operation; river management; streamflow prediction; Thailand,OPTIMIZATION MODEL; GENETIC ALGORITHM; SOIL-MOISTURE; CLIMATE; SKILL; PRECIPITATION,,MDPI,BASEL,"ST ALBAN-ANLAGE 66, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND",,2073-4441,,WATER-SUI,Water,NOV,2020,12,11,,,3210,
75,Valuing Enhanced Hydrologic Data and Forecasting for Informing Hydropower Operations,"Climate change is rapidly modifying historic river flows and snowpack conditions in the Sierra Nevada in California and other seasonally snow-covered mountains. Statistical forecasting methods based on regressing summer flow against spring snow water equivalent, precipitation, and antecedent runoff are thus becoming increasingly inadequate for water-resources decision making, which can lead to missed opportunities in maximizing beneficial uses, including the value of hydropower resources. An enhanced forecasting method using a process-based model and spatially distributed wireless sensor data offers more accurate runoff forecasts. In this paper, we assessed the forecasting accuracy of these two forecasting methods by applying them to two tributaries within the North Fork Feather River basin in California. The result shows the enhanced forecasting method having better accuracy than the statistical model. In addition, a hydropower simulation showed a considerable increase in energy value with the enhanced forecasting informing reservoir operations. The investment analysis on applying this method shows an average internal rate of return of 31% across all scenarios, making this forecasting method an attractive way to better inform water-related decisions for hydropower generation in the context of climate change.",https://doi.org/10.3390/w13162260,10.3390/w13162260,"Guo, Han; Conklin, Martha; Maurer, Tessa; Avanzi, Francesco; Richards, Kevin; Bales, Roger",WATER,climate change; hydrology forecast; hydropower,CLIMATE-CHANGE IMPACTS,,MDPI,BASEL,"ST ALBAN-ANLAGE 66, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND",,2073-4441,,WATER-SUI,Water,AUG,2021,13,16,,,2260,
76,A Near-Term Iterative Forecasting System Successfully Predicts Reservoir Hydrodynamics and Partitions Uncertainty in Real Time,"Freshwater ecosystems are experiencing greater variability due to human activities, necessitating new tools to anticipate future water quality. In response, we developed and deployed a real-time iterative water temperature forecasting system (FLARE-Forecasting Lake And Reservoir Ecosystems). FLARE is composed of water temperature and meteorology sensors that wirelessly stream data, a data assimilation algorithm that uses sensor observations to update predictions from a hydrodynamic model and calibrate model parameters, and an ensemble-based forecasting algorithm to generate forecasts that include uncertainty. Importantly, FLARE quantifies the contribution of different sources of uncertainty (driver data, initial conditions, model process, and parameters) to each daily forecast of water temperature at multiple depths. We applied FLARE to Falling Creek Reservoir (Vinton, Virginia, USA), a drinking water supply, during a 475-day period encompassing stratified and mixed thermal conditions. Aggregated across this period, root mean square error (RMSE) of daily forecasted water temperatures was 1.13 degrees C at the reservoir's near-surface (1.0 m) for 7-day ahead forecasts and 1.62 degrees C for 16-day ahead forecasts. The RMSE of forecasted water temperatures at the near-sediments (8.0 m) was 0.87 degrees C for 7-day forecasts and 1.20 degrees C for 16-day forecasts. FLARE successfully predicted the onset of fall turnover 4-14 days in advance in two sequential years. Uncertainty partitioning identified meteorology driver data as the dominant source of uncertainty in forecasts for most depths and thermal conditions, except for the near-sediments in summer, when model process uncertainty dominated. Overall, FLARE provides an open-source system for lake and reservoir water quality forecasting to improve real-time management.",https://doi.org/10.1029/2019WR026138,10.1029/2019WR026138,"Thomas, R.

77,Coupling large-scale climate indices with a stochastic weather generator to improve long-term streamflow forecasts in a Canadian watershed,"This paper aims at improving long-term streamflow forecasts by implementing a novel technique based on conditioning the parameters of a stochastic weather generator on large-scale climate indices, with varying lengths of training periods during the establishment of correlations. The most important climate indices are identified by looking at yearly correlations between a set of 40 indices and meteorological data (precipitation and temperature) at the watershed scale. A linear model is then constructed to identify precipitation and temperature anomalies to induce perturbations in the stochastic weather generator. Time windows of 5, 10, 15, 20 and 30 years are used in determining the optimal linear model. The performance of the proposed approach is assessed against that of a resampling of past climatology and using the same stochastic weather generator unconditioned on climate indices. Each member of the ensemble weather forecast is then fed to a hydrological model to create the Ensemble Streamflow Forecasts (ESF) with a one-year forecasting horizon. The three approaches are tested in hindcast mode over a 30-year period at 12 forecast dates. Results show that temperatures are significantly correlated with large-scale climate indices, whereas precipitation is only weakly related to the same indices. The length of the time window has a considerable impact on the prediction ability of the linear models. The precipitation models based on short duration time windows performed better than those based on longer windows, while the reverse was found for the temperature models. A comparison between all three Ensemble Streamflow Forecast approaches is assessed using the Continuous Ranked Probability Score (CRPS) metric. Results show that the proposed method improves long-term streamflow forecasting, particularly the volumetric bias and the peak flows during the spring flood.",https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jhydrol.2020.125925,10.1016/j.jhydrol.2020.125925,"Sohrabi, Samaneh; Brissette, Francois P.; Arsenault, Richard",JOURNAL OF HYDROLOGY,Long-term streamflow forecast; Large-scale climate indices; Stochastic weather generator; Non-stationarity,LOW-FREQUENCY VARIABILITY; ENSEMBLE KALMAN FILTER; MODEL PARAMETERS; PRECIPITATION; PREDICTION; TEMPERATURE; SIMULATION; TIME; IMPACTS; ENSO,,ELSEVIER,AMSTERDAM,"RADARWEG 29, 1043 NX AMSTERDAM, NETHERLANDS",0022-1694,1879-2707,,J HYDROL,J.

78,Research of reservoir watershed fine zoning and flood forecasting method,"Flood disaster is an important threat to the safe operation of reservoirs. Accurate flood forecasting can provide important information for optimal reservoir operation. Generally, the characteristic of precipitation spatial distribution is analyzed based on observation of several discreet preset stations. This cannot catch the rainstorm center all the time and will lead to deviation in the characteristic of precipitation spatial distribution. Therefore, it can hardly arrive at optimal sub-watershed delineation and flood modeling. Therefore, a novel method is proposed for analysis of characteristic of precipitation spatial distribution in consideration of rainfall distribution and the delay of rainfall-runoff concentration. Based on the analysis results of precipitation spatial distribution, several key sub-basins which have significant impact on the flood process can be recognized. And then the elaborate sub-watershed delineation and flood modeling approach is put forward consequently on these key sub-basins. The efficacy of the proposed method is estimated on the flood forecasting of Zhexi reservoir watershed. The results verify that the proposed method can significantly improve the flood forecasting precision, which can provide important decision-making basis for reservoir operation.",https://doi.org/10.1007/s11069-017-3017-x,10.1007/s11069-017-3017-x,"Lu, Jiazheng; Guo, Jun; Yang, Li; Xu, Xunjian",NATURAL HAZARDS,Reservoir watershed; Flood forecasting; Sub-watershed delineation; Nash coefficient,ARTIFICIAL NEURAL-NETWORK; XINANJIANG MODEL; OPTIMIZATION,,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"233 SPRING ST, NEW YORK, NY 10013 USA",0921-030X,1573-0840,,NAT HAZARDS,Nat.

79,"A C-Vine Copula-Based Quantile Regression Method for Streamflow Forecasting in Xiangxi River Basin, China","In this study, a C-vine copula-based quantile regression (CVQR) model is proposed for forecasting monthly streamflow. The CVQR model integrates techniques for vine copulas and quantile regression into a framework that can effectively establish relationships between the multidimensional response-independent variables as well as capture the upper tail or asymmetric dependence (i.e., upper extreme values). The CVQR model is applied to the Xiangxi River basin that is located in the Three Gorges Reservoir area in China for monthly streamflow forecasting. Multiple linear regression (MLR) and artificial neural network (ANN) are also compared to illustrate the applicability of CVQR. The results show that the CVQR model performs best in the calibration period for monthly streamflow prediction. The results also indicate that MLR has the worst effects in extreme quantile (flood events) and confidence interval predictions. Moreover, the performance of ANN tends to be overestimated in the process of peak prediction. Notably, CVQR is the most effective at capturing upper tail dependences among the hydrometeorological variables (i.e., floods).

80,Integration of time series forecasting in a dynamic decision support system for multiple reservoir management to conserve water sources,"In most of arid and semi-arid regions, there are limited sources of available fresh water for different domestic and environmental demands. Strategic and parsimonious fresh water-use in water-scarce areas such as Southern New Mexico is crucially important. Elephant Butte and Caballo reservoirs are two integrated reservoirs in this region that provide water supply for many water users in downstream areas. Since Elephant Butte Reservoir is in a semi-arid region, it would be rational to utilize other energy sources such as wind energy to produce electricity and use the water supply to other critical demands in terms of time and availability. This study develops a strategy of optimal management of two integrated reservoirs to quantify the savable volume of water sources through optimal operation management. To optimize operations for the Elephant Butte and Caballo reservoirs as an integrated reservoir operation in New Mexico, the authors in this case study utilized two autoregressive integrated moving average models, one non-seasonal (daily, ARIMA model) and one seasonal (monthly, SARIMA model), to predict daily and monthly inflows to the Elephant Butte Reservoir. The coefficient of determination between predicted and observed daily values and the normalized mean of absolute error (NMAE) were 0.97 and 0.09, respectively, indicating that the daily ARIMA prediction model was significantly reliable and accurate for a univariate based streamflow forecast model. The developed time series prediction models were incorporated in a decision support system, which utilizes the predicted values for a day and a month ahead and leads to save significant amount of water volume by providing the optimal release schedule from Elephant Butte into the Caballo Reservoir. The predicted daily and monthly values from the developed ARIMA prediction models were integrated successfully with the dynamic operation model, which provides the optimal operation plans. The optimal operation plan significantly minimizes the total evaporation loss from both reservoirs by providing the optimal storage levels in both reservoirs. The saved volume of the water would be considered as a significant water supply for environmental conservation actions in downstream of the Caballo Reservoir. Providing an integrated optimal management plan for two reservoirs led to save significant water sources in a region that water shortage has led to significant environmental consequences. Finally, since the models are univariate, they demonstrate an approach for reliable inflow prediction when information is limited to only streamflow values. We find that hydroelectric power generation forces the region to lose significant amount of water to evaporation and therefore hinder the optimal use of freshwater. Based on these findings, we conclude that a water scarce region like Southern New Mexico should gain independence from hydroelectric power and save the freshwater for supporting ecosystem services and environmental purposes.",https://doi.org/10.1080/15567036.2018.1476934,10.1080/15567036.2018.1476934,"Sabzi, Hamed Zamani; Abudu, Shalamu; Alizadeh, Reza; Soltanisehat, Leili; Dilekli, Naci; King, James Phillip",ENERGY SOURCES PART A-RECOVERY UTILIZATION AND ENVIRONMENTAL EFFECTS,ARIMA; Decision support systems; dynamic systems; reservoir management; sarima; time series analysis,OPTIMIZATION; OPERATION; MODELS; PERFORMANCE; UNCERTAINTY; STREAMFLOW; ENERGY,,TAYLOR & FRANCIS INC,PHILADELPHIA,"530 WALNUT STREET, STE 850, PHILADELPHIA, PA 19106 USA",1556-7036,1556-7230,,ENERG SOURCE PART A,Energy Sources Part A-Recovery Util.

81,"Forecasting the evolution in the mixing regime of a deep subalpine lake under climate change scenarios through numerical modelling (Lake Maggiore, Northern Italy/Southern Switzerland)","The impact of air temperature rise is eminent for the large deep lakes in the Italian subalpine district, climate change being caused there by both natural phenomena and anthropogenic greenhouse-gases (GHG) emissions. These oligomictic lakes are experiencing a decrease in the frequency of winter full turnover and an intensification of stability. As a result, hypolimnetic oxygen concentrations are decreasing and nutrients are accumulating in bottom water, with effects on the whole ecosystem functioning. Forecasting the future evolution of the mixing pattern is relevant to assess if a reduction in GHG releases would be able to revert such processes. The study focuses on Lake Maggiore, for which the thermal structure evolution under climate change in the 2016-2085 period was assessed through numerical simulations, performed with the General Lake Model (GLM). Different prospects of regional air temperature rise were considered, given by the Swiss Climate Change Scenarios CH2011. Multiple realisations were performed for each scenario to obtain robust statistical predictions, adopting random series of meteorological data produced with the Vector-Autoregressive Weather Generator (VG). Results show that a reversion in the increasing thermal stability would be possible only if global GHG emissions started to be reduced by similar to 2020, allowing an equilibrium mixing regime to be restored by the end of the twenty-first century. Otherwise, persistent lack of complete-mixing, severe water warming and extensive effects on water quality are to be expected for the centuries to come.

82,Forecasting Water Inflow into the Tsimlyansk Reservoir during Spring Flood under Current Climate Conditions: Problems and Reproducibility,"Studies of water balance and variations of water regime of rivers in the Don Basin have shown a steady trend toward a decrease in spring flood volumes and an increase in runoff volume in winter since the mid-1980s. More frequent thaws have resulted in that snowmelt runoff formation can be seen almost throughout winter. A decrease in soil moisture content in the late October along with a decrease in the maximal freezing depth in the major portion of the basin increases water losses during thaws and at the early stages of spring flood. At a considerable decrease in the water equivalent of snow cover along with an appreciable increase in water losses, spring flood will not occur in some years. Therefore, changes in the climate and anthropogenic load considerably reduce the reliability of relationships developed in the XX century and used to forecast the spring inflow into the Tsymlyansk Reservoir.",https://doi.org/10.1134/S0097807820060159,10.1134/S0097807820060159,"Varentsova, N.

83,Predicting Inflow Rate of the Soyang River Dam Using Deep Learning Techniques,"The Soyang Dam, the largest multipurpose dam in Korea, faces water resource management challenges due to global warming. Global warming increases the duration and frequency of days with high temperatures and extreme precipitation events. Therefore, it is crucial to accurately predict the inflow rate for water resource management because it helps plan for flood, drought, and power generation in the Seoul metropolitan area. However, the lack of hydrological data for the Soyang River Dam causes a physical-based model to predict the inflow rate inaccurately. This study uses nearly 15 years of meteorological, dam, and weather warning data to overcome the lack of hydrological data and predict the inflow rate over two days. In addition, a sequence-to-sequence (Seq2Seq) mechanism combined with a bidirectional long short-term memory (LSTM) is developed to predict the inflow rate. The proposed model exhibits state-of-the-art prediction accuracy with root mean square error (RMSE) of 44.17 m(3)/s and 58.59 m(3)/s, mean absolute error (MAE) of 14.94 m(3)/s and 17.11 m(3)/s, and Nash-Sutcliffe efficiency (NSE) of 0.96 and 0.94, for forecasting first and second day, respectively.",https://doi.org/10.3390/w13172447,10.3390/w13172447,"Lee, Sangwon; Kim, Jaekwang",WATER,dam inflow; machine learning; bidirectional LSTM; Seq2Seq; deep learning,REGRESSION; MODEL,,MDPI,BASEL,"ST ALBAN-ANLAGE 66, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND",,2073-4441,,WATER-SUI,Water,SEP,2021,13,17,,,2447,
84,"Comparison of Deterministic and Statistical Models for Water Quality Compliance Forecasting in the San Joaquin River Basin, California","Model selection for water quality forecasting depends on many factors including analyst expertise and cost, stakeholder involvement and expected performance. Water quality forecasting in arid river basins is especially challenging given the importance of protecting beneficial uses in these environments and the livelihood of agricultural communities. In the agriculture-dominated San Joaquin River Basin of California, real-time salinity management (RTSM) is a state-sanctioned program that helps to maximize allowable salt export while protecting existing basin beneficial uses of water supply. The RTSM strategy supplants the federal total maximum daily load (TMDL) approach that could impose fines associated with exceedances of monthly and annual salt load allocations of up to $1 million per year based on average year hydrology and salt load export limits. The essential components of the current program include the establishment of telemetered sensor networks, a web-based information system for sharing data, a basin-scale salt load assimilative capacity forecasting model and institutional entities tasked with performing weekly forecasts of river salt assimilative capacity and scheduling west-side drainage export of salt loads. Web-based information portals have been developed to share model input data and salt assimilative capacity forecasts together with increasing stakeholder awareness and involvement in water quality resource management activities in the river basin. Two modeling approaches have been developed simultaneously. The first relies on a statistical analysis of the relationship between flow and salt concentration at three compliance monitoring sites and the use of these regression relationships for forecasting. The second salt load forecasting approach is a customized application of the Watershed Analysis Risk Management Framework (WARMF), a watershed water quality simulation model that has been configured to estimate daily river salt assimilative capacity and to provide decision support for real-time salinity management at the watershed level. Analysis of the results from both model-based forecasting approaches over a period of five years shows that the regression-based forecasting model, run daily Monday to Friday each week, provided marginally better performance. However, the regression-based forecasting model assumes the same general relationship between flow and salinity which breaks down during extreme weather events such as droughts when water allocation cutbacks among stakeholders are not evenly distributed across the basin. A recent test case shows the utility of both models in dealing with an exceedance event at one compliance monitoring site recently introduced in 2020.",https://doi.org/10.3390/w13192661,10.3390/w13192661,"Quinn, Nigel W.

85,Projecting future habitat quality of three midwestern reservoir fishes under warming conditions,"Rising temperatures caused by climate change are likely to affect cool-water and warm-water fishes differently. Yet, forecasts of anticipated temperature effects on fishes of different thermal guilds are lacking, especially in freshwater ecosystems. Towards this end, we used spatially explicit, growth rate potential (GRP) models to project changes in seasonal habitat quality for a warm-water piscivore (largemouth bass Micropterus salmoides), a cool-water piscivore (walleye Sander vitreus) and a hybrid piscivore (saugeye S. vitreus x S. canadensis) in two Midwestern reservoirs. We assessed habitat quality for two periods (early and middle 21st century) under two realistic greenhouse gas emission scenarios (a mid-century emissions peak and a rapid continuous increase in emissions). Largemouth bass were projected to experience enhanced or slightly reduced habitat during all seasons, and throughout the mid-21st century. By contrast, walleye habitat was projected to decline with anticipated warming, except during the spring in the smaller of our two study reservoirs and during the fall in the larger of our two study reservoirs. Saugeye habitat was projected to either increase modestly or decline slightly during the spring and fall and declines in habitat quality and quantity that were smaller than those for walleye were identified during summer. Collectively, our findings indicate that climate warming will differentially alter habitat suitability for reservoir piscivores, favouring warm-water species over cool-water species. We expect these changes in habitat quality to impact the dynamics of reservoir fish populations to varying degrees necessitating the consideration of climate when making future management decisions.",https://doi.org/10.1111/eff.12561,10.1111/eff.12561,"Budnik, Richard R.; Conroy, Joseph D.; Zweifel, Richard D.; Ludsin, Stuart A.; Marschall, Elizabeth A.",ECOLOGY OF FRESHWATER FISH,climate change; growth rate potential; habitat quality; largemouth bass; reservoirs; Sander spp,MENHADEN BREVOORTIA-TYRANNUS; WALLEYE SANDER-VITREUS; CLIMATE-CHANGE; SMALLMOUTH BASS; BIOENERGETICS MODELS; PREY AVAILABILITY; POTENTIAL IMPACTS; CALORIC DENSITIES; LARGEMOUTH BASS; YELLOW PERCH,,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0906-6691,1600-0633,,ECOL FRESHW FISH,Ecol.

86,"Spatial and temporal characteristics, influencing factors and prediction models of water quality and algae in early stage of Middle Route of South-North Water Diversion Project","The Middle Route (MR) of the South-to-North Water Diversion Project (SNWDP) of China is one of the world's largest interbasin water diversion projects. As an important source of drinking water in North China, its water quality safety determines the success or failure of a sizable water supply. At present, there is a lack of in-depth and systematic understanding of the interaction between hydrodynamics and the water environment as well as water ecological processes in the main canal at the early stages of operation. It is not currently possible to accurately predict water quality and algae status at the early stage of canal ecosystem succession. Change trends and distribution characteristics of the main water ecological environment elements in the main canal at the early MR stage are analyzed in this study. The main factors influencing algae are investigated by principal component analysis (PCA) to characterize the water quality and algae transport distribution in the main MR canal under the complex multi-sluice joint dispatching conditions. The relationship between environmental factors, hydrodynamic, water quality, and algae in the coupled canal-sluice system in the SNWDP MR is determined. Algae distributions under different water transmission conditions in a typical canal section are predicted accordingly. CODMn and algal density in the main canal are shown to increase from south to north along the canal. DO decreases from south to north; other water quality indexes do not significantly differ from north to south. Algal density along the canal differs to the greatest extent in summer, followed by spring and autumn, and is the weakest in winter. The predicted algae densities in the main canal under different water conveying conditions show that single sluice control and strong water flow from Taocha Head Section increase the flow velocity after passing through the sluice with a fixed opening. Algal density decreases flow rate increases under single sluice regulation conditions. The maximum rate of algal density change reaches 22.13% and 29.55% under double sluice and four sluice scheduling. Algae control effects grow significantly as the number of control sluices increases. The results of this work may provide technical support for water quality forecasting and algae risk warning in the SNWDP MR as well as a workable reference for similar projects.",https://doi.org/10.1007/s11356-021-16917-5,10.1007/s11356-021-16917-5,"Jing, Zheng; Chen, Hao; Cao, Huiqun; Tang, Xianqiang; Shang, Yuming; Liang, Yuhan; Luo, Ping'an; Luo, Huiping",ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE AND POLLUTION RESEARCH,South-to-North Water Diversion Project; First operating period; Multi-sluice joint dispatching; Spatial and temporal characteristics; Water quality and algae prediction model,ENVIRONMENTAL DRIVERS; PHOSPHORUS; RESERVOIR; NITROGEN; CHLOROPHYLL; BASIN,,SPRINGER HEIDELBERG,HEIDELBERG,"TIERGARTENSTRASSE 17, D-69121 HEIDELBERG, GERMANY",0944-1344,1614-7499,,ENVIRON SCI POLLUT R,Environ.

87,PREMHYCE: an operational tool for low-flow forecasting,"In many countries, rivers are the primary supply of water. A number of uses (drinking water, irrigation, hydropower horizontal ellipsis ) can be strongly affected by water shortages. Therefore, there is a need for the early anticipation of low-flow periods to improve water management. This is strengthened by the perspective of having more severe low flows in the context of climate change. Several French institutions have been collaborating over the last years to develop an operational tool for low-flow forecasting, called PREMHYCE. It was tested in real time on more than one hundred catchments in continental France since 2017. PREMHYCE includes five hydrological models, which are calibrated on gauged catchments and which assimilate flow observations. Low-flow forecasts can be issued up to 90 days ahead, based on Ensemble Streamflow Prediction (ESP) using historical climatic data as ensembles of future input scenarios. The performance of the forecasting tool is analysed on the 2017-2018 low flows on 38 catchments for which forecasts are available for all the models. The capacity to anticipate low-flow events shows an average anticipation of 40 days. The short-term forecast (7 days ahead) is good for most of the models.",https://doi.org/10.1051/lhb/2020043,10.1051/lhb/2020043,"Tilmant, Francois; Nicolle, Pierre; Bourgin, Francois; Besson, Francois; Delaigue, Olivier; Etchevers, Pierre; Francois, Didier; Le Lay, Matthieu; Perrin, Charles; Rousset, Fabienne; Thiery, Dominique; Magand, Claire; Leurent, Timothee; Jacob, Elise",HOUILLE BLANCHE-REVUE INTERNATIONALE DE L EAU,low-flow forecasts; hydrological model; ensemble forecasting; water resources management; drought,POTENTIAL EVAPOTRANSPIRATION MODEL; HYDROLOGICAL MODELS; RIVER; SENSITIVITY; SIMULATION; FRANCE,,EDP SCIENCES S A,LES ULIS CEDEX A,"17, AVE DU HOGGAR, PA COURTABOEUF, BP 112, F-91944 LES ULIS CEDEX A, FRANCE",0018-6368,1958-5551,,HOUILLE BLANCHE,Houille Blanche-Rev.

88,Individual-based models forecast the spread and inform the management of an emerging riverine invader,"Aim Mounting ecological impacts of invasive species on freshwater ecosystems are among the greatest challenges confronting ecologists and decision-makers in conserving biodiversity and ecosystem function. Tools to slow the proliferation of aquatic invasive species are still needed to guide the allocation of limited resources more effectively and efficiently once a species is already established. Here we develop mechanistic models to recreate the invasion history of the rusty crayfish Faxonius rusticus in the John Day River (JDR) basin, forecast its future distribution, and evaluate the management efficiency of, and trade-offs among, population control actions. Location Methods John Day River Basin, Oregon. The spread and control of rusty crayfish in the JDR was simulated with a spatially explicit individual-based model (SEIBM) whereby the life history of each crayfish in the population is modelled in response to environmental conditions that vary across space and time. The model was calibrated by comparing modelled rusty crayfish spread throughout the JDR to known occurrences according to three comprehensive surveys. Results Main conclusion Our model accurately reproduced historical rusty crayfish distribution data for 2005, 2010, and 2016 with a specificity and sensitivity of similar to 80%. Leveraging this realistic model of the spread of rusty crayfish, we show that rapid management actions to the initial invasion would have resulted in an opportunity to slow the spread of rusty crayfish. We instead predict that rusty crayfish will reach the mainstem of the Columbia River by 2025, at which our model predicts that the crayfish population will number on the order of 10(8) individuals over more than 1100 km of river throughout the watershed and progress into critical salmon spawning habitat. This study demonstrates that SEIBMs can provide unique insight into the future distribution of aquatic invasive species and concretely support decision-makers in choosing an optimal control strategy.",https://doi.org/10.1111/ddi.12829,10.1111/ddi.12829,"Messager, Mathis L.; Olden, Julian D.",DIVERSITY AND DISTRIBUTIONS,aquatic invasive species; crayfish; individual-based model; invasive species management; John Day River; secondary spread,CRAYFISH PROCAMBARUS-CLARKII; ORCONECTES-RUSTICUS GIRARD; JOHN DAY RIVER; PACIFASTACUS-LENIUSCULUS; SIGNAL CRAYFISH; POPULATION; INVASIONS; ERADICATION; PREDATION; FRAMEWORK,,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",1366-9516,1472-4642,,DIVERS DISTRIB,Divers.

89,Projected Hydroclimatic Changes in Two Major River Basins at the Canadian West Coast Based on High-Resolution Regional Climate Simulations,"The impact of anthropogenic climate change on water resources and flood and drought risk is of great interest for impact modeling and to inform adaptation strategies. Here an analysis of hydroclimatic changes in the Fraser and Athabasca River basins in western Canada is presented, based on an ensemble of climate projections, which have been dynamically downscaled to 10-km resolution using the Weather Research and Forecasting Model in two configurations. The GCM ensemble comprises four independent integrations of the Community Earth System Model under the representative concentration pathway 8.5. Basin-integrated changes in the seasonal cycle of hydroclimatic variables, and the variability of water supply and flood and drought risk, are considered. It is found that fall and winter precipitation generally increase by 20%-30% toward the end of the century, while changes in summer precipitation are smaller and associated with high model uncertainty. Furthermore, a reduction in snowfall and an increase in evapotranspiration are projected. However, projected impacts on water resources east and west of the Rocky Mountains are quite different: in basins closer to the coast (west of the Rocky Mountains) higher temperatures lead to a transition from predominantly solid to liquid precipitation and a significantly weaker spring freshet, followed by drier summers. In the lee of the Rocky Mountains the spring freshet remains largely unaffected and in summer the increase in evapotranspiration (ET) is compensated by increasing precipitation, so that water balance changes appear to be small. It is further found that a shift in runoff seasonality near the coast may lead to significantly increased flood risk in fall.",https://doi.org/10.1175/JCLI-D-16-0870.1,10.1175/JCLI-D-16-0870.1,"Erler, Andre R.; Peltier, W.

90,Assessment and projection of the water budget over western Canada using convection-permitting weather research and forecasting simulations,"Water resources in cold regions in western Canada face severe risks posed by anthropogenic global warming as evapotranspiration increases and precipitation regimes shift. Although understanding the water cycle is key for addressing climate change issues, it is difficult to obtain high spatial- and temporal-resolution observations of hydroclimatic processes, especially in remote regions. Climate models are useful tools for dissecting and diagnosing these processes, especially the convection-permitting (CP) high-resolution regional climate simulation, which provides advantages over lower-resolution models by explicitly representing convection. In addition to better representing convective systems, higher spatial resolution also better represents topography, mountain meteorology, and highly heterogeneous geophysical features. However, there is little work with convection-permitting regional climate models conducted over western Canada. Focusing on the Mackenzie River and Saskatchewan River basins, this study investigated the surface water budget and atmospheric moisture balance in historical and representative concentration pathway (RCP8.5) projections using 4 km CP Weather Research and Forecasting (WRF). We compared the high-resolution 4 km CP WRF and three common reanalysis datasets, namely the North American Regional Reanalysis (NARR), the Japanese 55-year Reanalysis (JRA-55), and European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts reanalysis interim dataset (ERA-Interim). High-resolution WRF outperforms the reanalyses in balancing the surface water budget in both river basins with much lower residual terms. For the pseudo-global-warming scenario at the end of the 21st century with representative concentration pathway (RCP8.5) radiative forcing, both the Mackenzie River and Saskatchewan River basins show increases in the amplitude for precipitation and evapotranspiration and a decrease in runoff. The Saskatchewan River basin (SRB) shows a moderate increase in precipitation in the west and a small decrease in the east. Combined with a significant increase in evapotranspiration in a warmer climate, the Saskatchewan River basin would have a larger deficit of water resources than in the current climate based on the pseudo-global-warming (PGW) simulation. The high-resolution simulation also shows that the difference of atmospheric water vapour balance in the two river basins is due to flow orientation and topography differences at the western boundaries of the two basins. The sensitivity of water vapour balance to fine-scale topography and atmospheric processes shown in this study demonstrates that high-resolution dynamical downscaling is important for large-scale water balance and hydrological cycles.",https://doi.org/10.5194/hess-24-3677-2020,10.5194/hess-24-3677-2020,"Kurkute, Sopan; Li, Zhenhua; Li, Yanping; Huo, Fei",HYDROLOGY AND EARTH SYSTEM SCIENCES,,CLIMATE-CHANGE; ECMWF MODEL; ERA-INTERIM; LAND; PARAMETERIZATION; IMPLEMENTATION; REPRESENTATION; PRECIPITATION; HYDROLOGY; STORAGE,,COPERNICUS GESELLSCHAFT MBH,GOTTINGEN,"BAHNHOFSALLEE 1E, GOTTINGEN, 37081, GERMANY",1027-5606,1607-7938,,HYDROL EARTH SYST SC,Hydrol.

92,Introduction of an Experimental Terrestrial Forecasting/Monitoring System at Regional to Continental Scales Based on the Terrestrial Systems Modeling Platform (v1.1.0),"Operational weather and flood forecasting has been performed successfully for decades and is of great socioeconomic importance. Up to now, forecast products focus on atmospheric variables, such as precipitation, air temperature and, in hydrology, on river discharge. Considering the full terrestrial system from groundwater across the land surface into the atmosphere, a number of important hydrologic variables are missing especially with regard to the shallow and deeper subsurface (e.g., groundwater), which are gaining considerable attention in the context of global change. In this study, we propose a terrestrial monitoring/forecasting system using the Terrestrial Systems Modeling Platform (TSMP) that predicts all essential states and fluxes of the terrestrial hydrologic and energy cycles from groundwater into the atmosphere. Closure of the terrestrial cycles provides a physically consistent picture of the terrestrial system in TSMP. TSMP has been implemented over a regional domain over North Rhine-Westphalia and a continental domain over Europe in a real-time forecast/monitoring workflow. Applying a real-time forecasting/monitoring workflow over both domains, experimental forecasts are being produced with different lead times since the beginning of 2016. Real-time forecast/monitoring products encompass all compartments of the terrestrial system including additional hydrologic variables, such as plant available soil water, groundwater table depth, and groundwater recharge and storage.",https://doi.org/10.3390/w10111697,10.3390/w10111697,"Kollet, Stefan; Gasper, Fabian; Brdar, Slavko; Goergen, Klaus; Hendricks-Franssen, Harrie-Jan; Keune, Jessica; Kurtz, Wolfgang; Kuell, Volker; Pappenberger, Florian; Poll, Stefan; Troemel, Silke; Shrestha, Prabhakar; Simmer, Clemens; Sulis, Mauro",WATER,terrestrial modeling; real-time forecasting/monitoring; workflows,RAINFALL MEASUREMENT; WEATHER PREDICTION; FORECAST SYSTEM; GROUNDWATER; PARALLEL; ATTENUATION; COSMO,,MDPI,BASEL,"ST ALBAN-ANLAGE 66, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND",2073-4441,,,WATER-SUI,Water,NOV,2018,10,11,,,1697,
93,p A Multivariate and Multistage Streamflow Prediction Model Based on Signal Decomposition Techniques with Deep Learning,"Accurate streamflow forecast plays an important role in the flood control operation of reservoir and water resource management, and how to build a prediction model with high accuracy is a research hotspot. In order to improve the prediction accuracy, this paper establishes a multivariate and multistage streamflow prediction model based on the combination of mode decomposition and deep learning models, including the variational mode decomposition (VMD), improved complete ensemble empirical mode decomposition with adaptive noise (ICEEMD), convolutional neural network (CNN), and long short-term memory (LSTM). Taking the Wei River Basin (WRB) of China as an example, streamflow in six hydrometric stations from the main stream of the WRB is used to validate the model. The results show that the proposed model have good prediction skills, and the prediction results of multistage models are better than single-stage models; however, the most complex models do not have the best results. The VMD also preformed better prediction skills than ICEEMD, and the optimal model was VCL (VMD-CNN-LSTM). The root-mean-square error, peak percentage of threshold statistic, and Nash-Sutcliffe efficiency coefficient of VCL at Huaxian station are 43.82 m3/s, 10.02%, and 0.94, respectively. The models proposed in this paper are suitable for streamflow forecasting, which provide reference for streamflow forecasting and sustainable watershed management.",https://doi.org/10.2112/JCOASTRES-D-21-00011.1,10.2112/JCOASTRES-D-21-00011.1,"Yan, Dongfei; Jiang, Rengui; Xie, Jiancang; Zhu, Jiwei; Liang, Jichao; Wang, Yinping",JOURNAL OF COASTAL RESEARCH,ADDITIONAL INDEX WORDS: Variational mode decomposition; ensemble empirical mode decomposition; long short; term memory; neural network; Wei River Basin,WEI RIVER-BASIN; NINO-SOUTHERN-OSCILLATION; SHORT-TERM-MEMORY; FORECASTING-MODEL; ANNUAL RUNOFF; EVENTS,,COASTAL EDUCATION & RESEARCH FOUNDATION,COCONUT CREEK,"5130 NW 54TH STREET, COCONUT CREEK, FL 33073 USA",0749-0208,1551-5036,,J COASTAL RES,J.

94,Utilizing Bivariate Climate Forecasts to Update the Probabilities of Ensemble Streamflow Prediction,"In order to enhance the streamflow forecast skill, seasonal/sub-seasonal streamflow forecasts can be post-processed by incorporating new information, such as climate signals. This study proposed a simple yet efficient approach, the Bivar_update model that utilizes bivariate climate forecast to update individual probabilities of the ensemble streamflow prediction. The Bayesian updating scheme is used to update the joint probability mass function derived from historic precipitation and temperature data sets. Thirty-five dam basins were used for the case study, and the modified Tank model was embedded into the ensemble streamflow prediction framework. The performance of the proposed approach was evaluated through a comparison with a reference streamflow forecast model, the Univar_update model, that reflects only precipitation forecast, in terms of deterministic and categorical streamflow forecast accuracy. For this purpose, multiple cases of probabilistic precipitation and temperature forecasts were synthetically generated. As a result, the Bivar_update model was able to decrease the errors in forecast under below-normal conditions. The improvements in forecasting skills were found for both measures; deterministic and categorical streamflow forecasts. Since the proposed Bivar_update model reflects both precipitation and temperature information, it can compensate low predictability especially under dry conditions in which the streamflow's dependency on temperature increases.",https://doi.org/10.3390/su12072905,10.3390/su12072905,"Sung, Jang Hyun; Ryu, Young; Seo, Seung Beom",SUSTAINABILITY,probabilistic forecast; Bayesian update; Croley-Wilks; joint probability mass function; ensemble streamflow prediction,PRECIPITATION; TEMPERATURE; IMPACTS; WEATHER; MODEL; OPTIMIZATION; SIMULATIONS; DROUGHT; KOREA,,MDPI,BASEL,"ST ALBAN-ANLAGE 66, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND",,2071-1050,,SUSTAINABILITY-BASEL,Sustainability,APR,2020,12,7,,,2905,
95,Trophic state indicators are a better predictor of Florida bass condition compared to temperature in Florida's freshwater bodies,"Forecasted increases in global temperatures will likely have profound effects on freshwater fishes. Overlaid on increasing global temperatures, human populations are expected to grow, which will increase anthropogenic nutrient enrichment in freshwater ecosystems. Florida (US) represents the equatorial range limit for many freshwater fishes, thus these species are potentially at risk to climate warming. Likewise, Florida's population is expected to aggressively expand, increasing risk for nutrient enrichment. In this study, we examined whether maximum water temperatures or trophic state indicators (a proxy for nutrient enrichment) better explains variation in Florida Bass (Micropterus salmoides floridanus) condition across 23 different Florida freshwater bodies distributed throughout the state. Florida Bass lengths and weights, temperature, and chlorophyll-alpha, total phosphorous (TP), and total nitrogen (TN) measures were collected in the late summer and fall from 2010 to 2012. We described relationships between bass relative condition and environmental measurements (temperature, and trophic state indicators) across these lake-year combinations using linear and non-linear regressions. We found no significant relationship between temperature and bass condition (r(2) = 0.01). However, we found that trophic state indicators did predict bass condition (r(2) = 0.39-0.50). Though research is needed to more rigorously assess the effects of rising temperature on bass condition, our results may suggest that lake productivity is currently an influential driver on Florida Bass. As such, management efforts should continue to closely monitor and manage water quality and potential nutrient enrichment in Florida's freshwater waters, as bass condition appears to be closely tied to lake productivity.",https://doi.org/10.1007/s10641-017-0635-9,10.1007/s10641-017-0635-9,"Boucek, Ross; Barrientos, Christian; Bush, Michael R.; Gandy, David A.; Wilson, Kyle L.; Young, Joy M.",ENVIRONMENTAL BIOLOGY OF FISHES,Florida bass; Lake productivity; Florida; Condition,LARGEMOUTH BASS; CLIMATE-CHANGE; MICROPTERUS-SALMOIDES; OXYGEN LIMITATION; THERMAL TOLERANCE; BODY CONDITION; FISH; LAKE; PRODUCTIVITY; NORTHERN,,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"233 SPRING ST, NEW YORK, NY 10013 USA",0378-1909,1573-5133,,ENVIRON BIOL FISH,Environ.

96,Historical citizen science to understand and predict climate-driven trout decline,"Historical species records offer an excellent opportunity to test the predictive ability of range forecasts under climate change, but researchers often consider that historical records are scarce and unreliable, besides the datasets collected by renowned naturalists. Here, we demonstrate the relevance of biodiversity records developed through citizen-science initiatives generated outside the natural sciences academia. We used a Spanish geographical dictionary from the mid-nineteenth century to compile over 10 000 freshwater fish records, including almost 4 000 brown trout (Salmo trutta) citations, and constructed a historical presence-absence dataset covering over 2 000 10 x 10 km cells, which is comparable to present-day data. There has been a clear reduction in trout range in the past 150 years, coinciding with a generalized warming. We show that current trout distribution can be accurately predicted based on historical records and past and present values of three air temperature variables. The models indicate a consistent decline of average suitability of around 25% between 1850s and 2000s, which is expected to surpass 40% by the 2050s.

97,The Value of Long-Term Streamflow Forecasts in Adaptive Reservoir Operation: The Case of the High Aswan Dam in the Transboundary Nile River Basin,"Transboundary river basins are experiencing extensive dam development that challenges future water management, especially for downstream nations. Thus, adapting the operation of existing reservoirs is indispensable to cope with alterations in flow regime. We proposed a Forecast-Based Adaptive Reservoir Operation (FARO) framework to evaluate the use of long-term climate forecasts in improving real-time reservoir operations. The FARO approach was applied to the High Aswan Dam (HAD) in the Nile River basin. Monthly precipitation and temperature forecasts at up to 12 months of lead time are used from a suite of eight North American Multi-Model Ensemble (NMME) models. The value of NMME-based forecasts to reservoir operations was compared with perfect and climatology-based forecasts over an optimization horizon of 10 years from 1993 to 2002. Our results indicated that the forecast horizon for HAD operation ranges between 5 and 12 months lead time at low- and high-demand scenarios, respectively, beyond which the forecast information no longer improves the release decision. The forecast value to HAD operation is more pronounced in the months following the flooding season (October-December). During these months, the skill of streamflow forecasts using NMME forcings outperforms the climatology-based forecasts. When considering the operation of upstream Grand Ethiopian Renaissance Dam (GERD), using streamflow forecasts minimally helps to maintain current target objectives of HAD operation and therefore result in higher operation costs as opposed to current conditions without GERD. Our study underlined the importance of deriving a new adaptive operating policy for HAD to improve the value of available forecasts while considering GERD filling and operation phases. SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT Water management in the Nile River basin is challenged by the construction of the Grand Ethiopian Renaissance Dam (GERD) in Ethiopia. Thus, it becomes important to adapt the operation of existing dams to expected alteration in upstream flow. This study aims to use long-term forecasts to improve real-time operations of the High Aswan Dam (HAD) in Egypt. Forecasting streamflow up to 8 months ahead showed a significant improvement in the HAD operation. However, when considering GERD, using forecasts could minimally help to maintain current objectives of HAD operation. Our findings underline the importance of deriving a new operating policy for HAD to improve the value of available forecasts while considering future upstream projects.",https://doi.org/10.1175/JHM-D-20-0241.1,10.1175/JHM-D-20-0241.1,"Eldardiry, Hisham; Hossain, Faisal",JOURNAL OF HYDROMETEOROLOGY,Rivers; Forecast verification; skill; Operational forecasting; Seasonal forecasting; Hydrologic models; Optimization,BLUE-NILE; WATER-RESOURCES; MODEL; SYSTEMS; RULES; LEAD; PREDICTABILITY; UNCERTAINTY; PREDICTION; RAINFALL,,AMER METEOROLOGICAL SOC,BOSTON,"45 BEACON ST, BOSTON, MA 02108-3693 USA",1525-755X,1525-7541,,J HYDROMETEOROL,J.

98,Enhancing the Forecasting of Monthly Streamflow in the Main Key Stations of the River Nile Basins,"Predicting the streamflow of rivers can have a significant economic impact, as this can help in agricultural water management and in providing protection from water shortages and possible flood damage. In this study, two statistical models have been used; Deseasonalized Autoregressive moving average model (DARMA) and Artificial Neural Network (ANN) to predict monthly streamflow which important for reservoir operation policy using different time scale, monthly and 1/3 monthly (ten-days) flow data for River Nile basin at five key stations. The streamflow series is deseasonalized at different time scale and then an appropriate nonseasonal stochastic DARMA (p, q) models are built by using the plots of Partial Auto Correlation Function (PACF) to determine the order (p) of DARMA model. Then the deseasonalized data for key stations are used as input to ANN models with lags equals to the order (p) of DARMA model. The performance of ANN and DARMA models are compared using statistical methods. The results show that the developed model (using 1/3 monthly (ten-days) and ANN) has the best performance to predict monthly streamflow at all key stations. The results also show that the relative error in the developed model result did not exceed 9% while in the traditional models reach to 68% in the flood months in the testing period. The result also indicates that ANN has considerable potential for river flow forecasting.",https://doi.org/10.1134/S0097807818050135,10.1134/S0097807818050135,"Elganiny, Mohammed A.; Eldwer, Alaa Esmail",WATER RESOURCES,River Nile; DARMA model; ANN model; statistical models,ARTIFICIAL NEURAL-NETWORK; RAINFALL-RUNOFF MODEL; PREDICTION,,MAIK NAUKA/INTERPERIODICA/SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"233 SPRING ST, NEW YORK, NY 10013-1578 USA",0097-8078,1608-344X,,WATER RESOUR+,Water Resour.,SEP,2018,45,5,660,671,,
99,Utilizing Probabilistic Downscaling Methods to Develop Streamflow Forecasts from Climate Forecasts,"Statistical information from ensembles of climate forecasts can be utilized in improving the streamflow predictions by using different downscaling methods. This study investigates the use of multinomial logistic regression (MLR) in downscaling large-scale ensemble climate forecasts into basin-scale probabilistic streamflow forecasts of categorical events over major river basins across the U.S. Sun Belt. The performance of MLR is then compared with the categorical forecasts estimated from the traditional approach, principal component regression (PCR). Results from both cross validation and split sampling reveal that in general, the probabilistic categorical forecasts from the MLR model have more accuracy and exhibit higher rank probability skill score (RPSS) compared to the PCR probabilistic forecasts. MLR forecasts are also more skillful than PCR forecasts during the winter season as well as for basins that exhibit high interannual variability in streamflows. The role of ensemble size of precipitation forecasts in developing MLR-based streamflow forecasts was also investigated. Because of its simplicity, MLR offers an alternate, reliable approach to developing categorical streamflow forecasts.",https://doi.org/10.1175/JHM-D-17-0021.1,10.1175/JHM-D-17-0021.1,"Mazrooei, Amirhossein; Sankarasubramanian, A.",JOURNAL OF HYDROMETEOROLOGY,,UNITED-STATES; MULTIMODEL COMBINATION; DATA ASSIMILATION; PREDICTION; PRECIPITATION; MODEL; SKILL; LONG; TEMPERATURE; PROJECT,,AMER METEOROLOGICAL SOC,BOSTON,"45 BEACON ST, BOSTON, MA 02108-3693 USA",1525-755X,1525-7541,,J HYDROMETEOROL,J.

100,Evaluation of the Subseasonal Forecast Skill of Floods Associated with Atmospheric Rivers in Coastal Western US Watersheds,"Atmospheric rivers (ARs) are responsible for up to 90% of major flood events along the U.S. West Coast. The time scale of subseasonal forecasting (from 2 weeks to 1 month) is a critical lead time for proactive mitigation of flood disasters. The NOAA Climate Testbed Subseasonal Experiment (SubX) is a research-to-operations project with almost immediate availability of forecasts. It has produced a reforecast database that facilitates evaluation of flood forecasts at these subseasonal lead times. Here, we examine the SubX-driven forecast skill of AR-related flooding out to 4-week lead using the Distributed Hydrology Soil Vegetation Model (DHSVM), with particular attention to the role of antecedent soil moisture (ASM), which modulates the relationship between meteorological and hydrological forecast skill. We study three watersheds along a transect of the U.S. West Coast: the Chehalis River basin in Washington, the Russian River basin in Northern California, and the Santa Margarita River basin in Southern California. We find that the SubX-driven flood forecast skill drops quickly after week 1, during which there is relatively high deterministic forecast skill. We find some probabilistic forecast skill relative to climatology as well as ensemble streamflow prediction (ESP) in week 2, but minimal skill in weeks 3-4, especially for annual maximum floods, notwithstanding some probabilistic skill for smaller floods in week 3. Using ESP and reverse-ESP experiments to consider the relative influence of ASM and SubX reforecast skill, we find that ASM dominates probabilistic forecast skill only for small flood events at week 1, while SubX reforecast skill dominates for large flood events at all lead times.",https://doi.org/10.1175/JHM-D-20-0219.1,10.1175/JHM-D-20-0219.1,"Cao, Qian; Shukla, Shraddhanand; DeFlorio, Michael J.; Ralph, F.

101,Improving real-time reservoir operation during flood season by making the most of streamflow forecasts,"Streamflow forecasts play an important role in real-time reservoir operation, especially during the flood season. However, nowcast, short-term, and mid-term forecasts have significant differences in their uncertainties, leading to a gap between these forecasts and their combined use. To make the most of these forecasts, this paper defines a reliable forecast horizon (RFH) and proposes a model based on the three-stage-based operation rule (Three-OR), in which the streamflow forecasts are jointly used with different levels of uncertainty. To evaluate the effectiveness and efficiency of the proposed model, it is applied to the Wan'an Reservoir located at the midstream of the Ganjiang River in China with the objectives of flood control and water utilization (i.e., hydropower generation and water supply). The results reveal the following: 1) both flood control and water utilization can be improved when compared with the current operation rule; 2) floods with a higher peak and larger volume gain more improvements using Three-OR; 3) a smaller difference in the forecast error produces better operation performance in water utilization; and 4) the extension of the RFH is beneficial for reservoir operation, as it can help to improve flood control if the flood is large; otherwise, it can help improve water utilization. In summary, the proposed model based on Three-OR can make the best use of streamflow information, thus improving the real-time reservoir operation during the flood season.",https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jhydrol.2021.126017,10.1016/j.jhydrol.2021.126017,"Wang, Jiabiao; Zhao, Tongtiegang; Zhao, Jianshi; Wang, Hao; Lei, Xiaohui",JOURNAL OF HYDROLOGY,Three-stage; Reliable forecast horizon; Flood control; Water utilization; KKT,SHORT-TERM OPERATION; MULTIPURPOSE RESERVOIR; RISK ANALYSIS; UNCERTAINTY; MANAGEMENT; MODELS; SKILL,,ELSEVIER,AMSTERDAM,"RADARWEG 29, 1043 NX AMSTERDAM, NETHERLANDS",0022-1694,1879-2707,,J HYDROL,J.

102,Sensitivity of Forecast Value in Multiobjective Reservoir Operation to Forecast Lead Time and Reservoir Characteristics,"Streamflow forecasts can be used to improve reservoir operation decision-making, yet the sensitivity of forecast value to forecast lead time and reservoir characteristics in multiobjective reservoir operations is rarely investigated simultaneously. We incorporate streamflow forecasts into reservoir operation by applying radial basis functions (RBFs) and evaluate the forecast value conditioned on different types of forecast lead time and reservoir characteristics. From a case study of the Danjiangkou Reservoir in the Hanjiang River basin, China, forecast value is assessed by comparing Pareto fronts of forecast-informed and no-forecast reservoir operation rules from multiobjective optimization algorithms maximizing power generation and water supply. Subsequently, we vary the installed hydropower plant capacity and capacity-inflow ratio (ratio of active reservoir storage capacity and annual reservoir inflow volume) of the Danjiangkou Reservoir to investigate corresponding forecast values in terms of magnitude and distribution. The results demonstrate that the inclusion of streamflow forecasts predominantly leads to an increase in power generation in wet years, yet the monthly distribution of generation varies with water supply. Additionally, forecast value increases with forecast lead time, resulting in approximately 10, 15, and 18 million yuan annually for forecast lead times of 10, 20, and 30 days, respectively. Finally, forecast value is demonstrated to generally increase as installed capacity increases and decrease as capacity-inflow ratio increases, however, the distribution of forecast value within a year is more sensitive to the capacity-inflow ratio.",https://doi.org/10.1061/(ASCE)WR.1943-5452.0001384,10.1061/(ASCE)WR.1943-5452.0001384,"Yang, Guang; Guo, Shenglian; Liu, Pan; Block, Paul",JOURNAL OF WATER RESOURCES PLANNING AND MANAGEMENT,Multiobjective reservoir operation; Forecast-informed rules; Forecast value; Sensitivity analysis; Reservoir characteristics,STREAMFLOW FORECASTS; POLICY SEARCH; OPTIMIZATION; MANAGEMENT; RULES; PREDICTION; FRAMEWORK; SYSTEMS; UNCERTAINTY; SELECTION,,ASCE-AMER SOC CIVIL ENGINEERS,RESTON,"1801 ALEXANDER BELL DR, RESTON, VA 20191-4400 USA",0733-9496,1943-5452,,J WATER RES PLAN MAN,J.

103,Application of Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) Neural Network for Flood Forecasting,"Flood forecasting is an essential requirement in integrated water resource management. This paper suggests a Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) neural network model for flood forecasting, where the daily discharge and rainfall were used as input data. Moreover, characteristics of the data sets which may influence the model performance were also of interest. As a result, the Da River basin in Vietnam was chosen and two different combinations of input data sets from before 1985 (when the Hoa Binh dam was built) were used for one-day, two-day, and three-day flowrate forecasting ahead at Hoa Binh Station. The predictive ability of the model is quite impressive: The Nash-Sutcliffe efficiency (NSE) reached 99%, 95%, and 87% corresponding to three forecasting cases, respectively. The findings of this study suggest a viable option for flood forecasting on the Da River in Vietnam, where the river basin stretches between many countries and downstream flows (Vietnam) may fluctuate suddenly due to flood discharge from upstream hydroelectric reservoirs.",https://doi.org/10.3390/w11071387,10.3390/w11071387,"Le, Xuan-Hien; Hung Viet Ho; Lee, Giha; Jung, Sungho",WATER,flood forecasting; Artificial Neural Network (ANN); Recurrent Neural Network (RNN); Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM); deep neural network; Da river,REGRESSION; MODEL,,MDPI,BASEL,"ST ALBAN-ANLAGE 66, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND",2073-4441,,,WATER-SUI,Water,JUL,2019,11,7,,,1387,
104,"Real-Time Data and Flood Forecasting in Tagus Basin. A Case Study: Rosarito and El Burguillo Reservoirs from 8th to 12th March, 2018","The hydrological regime of the Iberian Peninsula is characterized by its extreme irregularity, including its propensity for periodic floods, which cause severe floods. The development of suitable cartographies and hydraulic models (HEC-RAS, IBER, etc.) allows for defining, with sufficient precision, the areas flooded by a determined return period, and for elaborating maps of danger and areas at risk of flooding, making it possible to adopt the corresponding preventive measures of spatial planning. These preventive measures do not avoid the need for contingent plans, such as the Civil Flooding Protection Plans. Many of the Peninsula's watercourses and rivers are regulated by reservoirs built to ensure water supply and to smooth floods by releasing water in extreme hydrological climates. Hydrological modeling tools (rain/run-off) and Decision Support Systems DSS have been developed for the optimal operation of these dams in flood situations. The objective of the article is to study and prove the effectiveness of the integrated data provision in real time, while the event occurs-a circumstance that was not possible from the limited available meteorological stations available from Official Weather Services. The development of the Automatic Hydrological Information System (SAIH) in the Spanish River Basin Authorities (Confederaciones Hidrograficas), which includes a dense network of thermo-pluviometric stations and rain-river flow gauges, has allowed for new perspectives in order to realize an effective forecast method of flows during episodes of extreme precipitation. In this article, we will describe the integration of a hydrological modeling system, developed by the Confederacion Hidrografica del Tajo (River Authority), to meet the described objectives; the results of this methodology are novel. This allows for the processing of the 15-minute data provided, including the simulation of the snow accumulation/melting processes and the forecast of inflows to the reservoir to help in the establishment of safeguards and preventive waterflow releases. Finally, the methodology described is shown in a real case of study at Rosarito and El Burguillo Reservoirs.",https://doi.org/10.3390/w12041004,10.3390/w12041004,"Menendez Pidal, Ignacio; Hinojal Martin, Jose Antonio; Mora Alonso-Munoyerro, Justo; Sanz Perez, Eugenio",WATER,flood forecasting; snow cover control; flood management; Tagus Basin,,,MDPI,BASEL,"ST ALBAN-ANLAGE 66, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND",,2073-4441,,WATER-SUI,Water,APR,2020,12,4,,,1004,
105,Performance assessment of artificial neural networks and support vector regression models for stream flow predictions,"Water resources planning, development, and management need reliable forecasts of river flows. In past few decades, an important dimension has been introduced in the prediction of the hydrologic phenomenon through artificial intelligence-based modeling. In this paper, the performance of three artificial neural network (ANN) and four support vector regression (SVR) models was investigated to predict streamflows in the Upper Indus River. Results from ANN models using three different optimization techniques, namely Broyden-Fletcher-Goldfarb-Shannon, Conjugate Gradient, and Back Propagation algorithms, were compared with one another. A further comparison was made between these ANNs and four types of SVR models which were based on linear, polynomial, radial basis function, and sigmoid kernels. Past 30years' monthly data for precipitation, temperature, and streamflow obtained from Pakistan Surface Water Hydrology Department Lahore were used for this purpose. Three types of input combinations with respect to the main input variables (temperature, precipitation, and stream flow) and several types of input combinations with respect to time lag were tested. The best input for ANN and SVR models was identified using correlation coefficient analysis and genetic algorithm. The performance of the ANN and SVR models was evaluated by mean bias error, Nash-Sutcliffe efficiency, root mean square error, and correlation coefficient. The efficiency of the Broyden-Fletcher-Goldfarb-Shannon-ANN model was found to be much better than that of other models, while the SVR model based on radial basis function kernel predicted stream flows with comparatively higher accuracy than the other kernels. Finally, long-term predictions of streamflow have been made by the best ANN model. It was found that stream flow of Upper Indus River has a decreasing trend.",https://doi.org/10.1007/s10661-018-7012-9,10.1007/s10661-018-7012-9,"Ateeq-ur-Rauf; Ghumman, Abdul Razzaq; Ahmad, Sajjad; Hashmi, Hashim Nisar",ENVIRONMENTAL MONITORING AND ASSESSMENT,Artificial neural network; Support vector regression; Indus River; Genetic algorithm; Streamflow forecast,QUASI-NEWTON METHOD; CLIMATE-CHANGE; RUNOFF; BASIN; ANN,,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0167-6369,1573-2959,,ENVIRON MONIT ASSESS,Environ.

The objective was to describe, through land use/land cover change (LUCC), the natural physical processes under current conditions and to project them to 2029. Moreover, temperature and precipitation forecasts were estimated to detail possible effects of climate change. Using remote sensing techniques, satellite images were processed to prepare a projection to 2029. Water recharge was estimated considering the effects of slope, groundcover, and soil texture. Flash floods were estimated using lumped models, concatenating the information to HEC RAS. Water availability was estimated with a semi-distributed hydrological model (SWAT). Precipitation and temperature data were forecasted using autoregressive and exponential smoothing models. Under the forecast, forest and shrub covers show a growth of 6.6%, water recharge projects an increase of 7.16%. Flood flows suffer a reduction of up to 16.54%, and the flow regime with a 90% of probability of exceedance is 1.85% (7.72 l/s) higher for 2029 than for the 2019 scenario, so an improvement in flow regulation is evident. Forecasts show an increase in average temperature of 0.11 degrees C and 15.63% in extreme rainfall by 2029. Therefore, intervention strategies in Andean basins should be supported by prospective studies that use these key variables of the system for an integrated management of water resources.",https://doi.org/10.3390/land10050513,10.3390/land10050513,"Mera-Parra, Christian; Onate-Valdivieso, Fernando; Massa-Sanchez, Priscilla; Ochoa-Cueva, Pablo",LAND,land use; land cover change; water recharge; flooding; meteorological forecast; hydrological response; IWRM,USE CHANGE IMPACTS; CLIMATE-CHANGE; COVER CHANGE; FOREST; FLOW; MANAGEMENT; CATCHMENT; TOOLS; MAPS; NDVI,,MDPI,BASEL,"ST ALBAN-ANLAGE 66, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND",,2073-445X,,LAND-BASEL,Land,MAY,2021,10,5,,,513,

Initially, the Kalman filter parameters are defined then recalculated for defined periods; that is, the model parameter values are constantly updated. Flows were forecasted six steps ahead (L=1, 2, 3, 4, 5 and 6 hours). The basin studied is part of the Huynamota River, delimited by the Chapalangana hydrometric station, upstream from the Aguamilpa reservoir, Nayarit, Mexico. The Huaynamota River is a tributary of the Santiago River. Hourly data series were used for precipitation and flow from August to September 2017. The DKF-ARX forecasting model showed Nash-Sutcliffe efficiency indexes between 0.99 and 0.85, with L=1 and L=6, respectively. It is concluded that it is feasible to obtain a good forecast of hourly streamflow with the discrete Kalman filter.",https://doi.org/,,"Alvarado-Hernandez, Leticia; Ibanez-Castillo, Laura A.; Ruiz-Garcia, Agustin; Gonzalez-Leiva, Fernando; Vazquez-Pena, Mario A.",AGROCIENCIA,discrete Kalman filter; autoregressive models; flow prediction,,,COLEGIO POSTGRADUADOS,MONTECILLO,"CARRETERA MEXICO TEXCOCO KM 36 5, MONTECILLO 56230, ESTADO MEXICO, MEXICO",1405-3195,,,AGROCIENCIA-MEXICO,Agrociencia,APR-MAY,2020,54,3,295,312,,
108,"Increasing Stormwater Capture and Recharge Using Forecast Informed Reservoir Operations, Prado Dam","The United States Army Corps of Engineers (USACE) operates Prado Dam in southern California for flood risk management and to capture stormwater for groundwater recharge. USACE and the Orange County Water District (OCWD) have collaborated for over 30 years to temporarily store Santa Ana River (SAR) stormflow at Prado Dam for groundwater recharge in the Orange County Groundwater Basin (Basin). USACE, OCWD, and other stakeholders are assessing Forecast Informed Reservoir Operations (FIRO) at Prado Dam as a new operational approach to capture additional supplies of SAR water for groundwater recharge without affecting Prado Dam's primary flood risk management purpose. Many dams, including Prado Dam, do not directly incorporate precipitation and streamflow forecasting in their operations. FIRO is an innovative research and operations partnership that uses weather forecasting, streamflow modeling, and watershed monitoring to help water managers selectively retain or release water from reservoirs in a manner that reflects current and forecasted conditions. A recently completed study, called a Preliminary Viability Assessment of FIRO at Prado Dam, determined that increased stormwater capture, beyond the current program, is viable subject to completion of additional studies. The ultimate increase in stormwater capture is anticipated to largely be a function of community and environmental tolerance for more frequent inundation rather than operational constraints of the dam. FIRO is a promising approach to operating Prado Dam that can increase SAR stormwater capture for recharge to the Basin, reducing the need for imported water and contributing to sustainable groundwater management.",https://doi.org/10.1111/gwat.13162,10.1111/gwat.13162,"Woodside, Greg D.; Hutchinson, Adam S.; Ralph, F.

109,"An enhanced extreme learning machine model for river flow forecasting: State-of-the-art, practical applications in water resource engineering area and future research direction","Despite the massive diversity in the modeling requirements for practical hydrological applications, there remains a need to develop more reliable and intelligent expert systems used for real-time prediction purposes. The challenge in meeting the standards of an expert system is primarily due to the influence and behavior of hydrological processes that is driven by natural fluctuations over the physical scale, and the resulting variance in the underlying model input datasets. River flow forecasting is an imperative task for water resources operation and management, water demand assessments, irrigation and agriculture, early flood warning and hydropower generations. This paper aims to investigate the viability of the enhanced version of extreme learning machine (EELM) model in river flow forecasting applied in a tropical environment. Herein, we apply the complete orthogonal decomposition (COD) learning tool to tune the output-hidden layer of the ELM model's internal neuronal system, instead of the conventional multi-resolution tool (e.g., singular value decomposition). To demonstrate the application of EELM model, the Kelantan River, located in the Malaysian peninsular, selected as a case study. For a comparison of the EELM model, and further model evaluation, two distinct data-intelligent models are developed (i.e., the classical ELM and the support vector regression, SVR model). An exhaustive list of diagnostic indicators are used to evaluate the EELM model in respect to the benchmark algorithms, namely, SVR and ELM. The model performance indicators exhibit superior results for the EELM model relative to ELM and SVR models. In addition, the EELM model is presented as a more accurate, alternative predictive tool for modelling the tropical river flow patterns and its underlying characteristic perturbations in the physical space. Several statistical metrics defined as the coefficient of determination (r), Nash-Sutcliffe efficiency (E-ns), Willmott's Index (WI), root-mean-square error (RMSE) and mean absolute error (MAE) are computed to assess the model's effectiveness. In quantitative terms, superiority of EELM over ELM and SVR models was exhibited by E-ns = 0.7995, 0.7434 and 0.665, r = 0.894, 0.869 and 0.818 and WI = 0.9380, 0.9180 and 0.8921, respectively. Whereas, EELM model attained lower (RMSE and MAE) values by approximately (11.61-22.53%) and (8.26-8.72%) relative to ELM and SVR models, respectively. The obtained results reveal that the EELM model is a robust expert model and can be embraced practically in real-life water resources management and river sustainability decisions. As a complementary component of this paper, we also review state-of-art research works where scholars have embraced extensive implementation of the ELM model in water resource engineering problems. A comprehensive evaluation is carried out to recognize the current limitations, and also to propose potential opportunities of applying improved variants of the ELM model presented as a future research direction.",https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jhydrol.2018.11.069,10.1016/j.jhydrol.2018.11.069,"Yaseen, Zaher Mundher; Sulaiman, Sadeq Oleiwi; Deo, Ravinesh C.; Chau, Kwok-Wing",JOURNAL OF HYDROLOGY,Extreme learning machine; Complete orthogonal decomposition; River flow forecasting; Water resources engineering; State-of-the-art; Future research direction,ARTIFICIAL NEURAL-NETWORK; GLOBAL SOLAR-RADIATION; FUZZY INFERENCE SYSTEM; PARTICLE SWARM OPTIMIZATION; SUPPORT VECTOR MACHINE; REFERENCE EVAPOTRANSPIRATION; HYBRID MODEL; STANDARDIZED PRECIPITATION; PERFORMANCE OPTIMIZATION; DISPLACEMENT PREDICTION,,ELSEVIER,AMSTERDAM,"RADARWEG 29, 1043 NX AMSTERDAM, NETHERLANDS",0022-1694,1879-2707,,J HYDROL,J.

110,CRML: A Convolution Regression Model With Machine Learning for Hydrology Forecasting,"Hydrologic disasters often result in substantial property damage and casualties. Therefore, hydrology forecasting, especially the flooding, has become a hot research spot in all countries of the world. Based on the basic principle of flooding formation, this paper proposes a data-driven hydrology forecasting model, i.e., the CRML (Convolution Regression based on Machine Learning). This model could reflect the impact of hourly rainfall on the future flow changes and the flow changes are predicted by superimposing these impacts. First, our work is implemented on historical data onto the Xixian River Basin in Henan Province, China. Through the data filtering, the training set of our model is constructed by using the flood process selection algorithm proposed in this paper. Next, the gradient descent algorithm is used to update the weights of the model, and the optimal weights are verified by ten flooding events generated in the past ten years. Finally, the numerical results show that the qualified rates of our model in predicting flood peak flow and its arrival time is approximately 90% and 100%, respectively. Compared with the latest popular artificial intelligence schemes, our model structure is clear and concise.

111,Coupling of a physically based lake model into the climate forecast system to improve winter climate forecasts for the Great Lakes region,"In this study, we coupled the two-layer one-dimensional Freshwater lake (FLake) model into the Climate Forecast System (CFS) version 2 to improve simulations of the effects of the Great Lakes on winter climate forecasts in that region. We first incorporated global lake fraction and depth data into the coupled CFS-FLake through a subgridding system. An interface between the CFS and FLake was then developed to link the two models for energy and water flux exchanges. The lake scheme was triggered only if the lake fraction was more than 10% in one CFS grid cell. We conducted ensemble retrospective forecasts with CFS-FLake for the period of 1997 through 2016 with 9 monthly leads. These forecasts were assessed to obtain a better understanding of the role of the Great Lakes in the climate system for winter, when significant lake-effect precipitation often occurs. Our results indicate that forecasts of lake surface temperature (LST), lake ice coverage (LIC), and precipitation with CFS-FLake were consistently better than those with CFS. The major improvements resulted from changes in land use type for the Great Lakes, from ocean and land in CFS to lakes in CFS-FLake. With the change from ocean to lake, LST mostly decreased with increasing LIC, resulting in lower surface heat and water fluxes to the atmosphere during the winter. However, with the change from land to lake, LST increased, leading to higher heat and water fluxes. In the meantime, precipitation predicted by CFS-FLake was reduced quite significantly over the Great Lakes compared to that by CFS. This reduction was caused by suppressed rising motion due to increased stability in the lower atmosphere as a result of lowered surface heat and water fluxes. The results from this study indicate that local and mesoscale surface and atmospheric processes significantly affect regional climate forecasts, and the coupled CFS-FLake model will have a broader impact on climate and hydrology research and forecasts.",https://doi.org/10.1007/s00382-019-04939-2,10.1007/s00382-019-04939-2,"Lv, Zhemin; Zhang, Shaobo; Jin, Jiming; Wu, Yihua; Ek, Michael B.",CLIMATE DYNAMICS,Climate forecasts; CFS; FLake; Lake-atmosphere coupled model; Lake effects,EFFECT SNOWSTORMS; HEAT FLUXES; ICE COVER; PREDICTION; SIMULATION; FLAKE; IMPLEMENTATION; BASIN,,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"ONE NEW YORK PLAZA, SUITE 4600, NEW YORK, NY, UNITED STATES",0930-7575,1432-0894,,CLIM DYNAM,Clim.

112,Hybrid Hydrological Data-Driven Approach for Daily Streamflow Forecasting,"Hydrological forecasting is key for water resources allocation and flood risk management. Although a number of advanced hydrological forecasting methods have been developed in the past, daily (or subdaily) forecasting remains a major challenge in engineering hydrology. The uncertainties associated with input data, model parameters, and model structure necessitate developing more robust modeling techniques. In this study, a hybrid machine-learning approach based on hydrological and data-driven modeling is developed for daily streamflow forecasting. The proposed hybrid hydrological data-driven model (HHDD) approach succeeds in improving daily prediction compared to that predicted by the standard conceptual hydrological model (HYMOD). In addition, the developed HHDD model is more robust in terms of providing direct uncertainty analysis results. The results indicate that a better resemblance of streamflow pattern is achieved by integrating physically based and data-driven approaches into the developed HHDD model.",https://doi.org/10.1061/(ASCE)HE.1943-5584.0001866,10.1061/(ASCE)HE.1943-5584.0001866,"Ghaith, Maysara; Siam, Ahmad; Li, Zhong; El-Dakhakhni, Wael",JOURNAL OF HYDROLOGIC ENGINEERING,Daily streamflow forecasting; Data-driven modeling; Hybrid modeling; Hydrological modeling; HYMOD; Uncertainty analysis,PARAMETER UNCERTAINTY; MODEL FORMULATION; CHAOHE BASIN; WAVELET; SWAT; ANN; OPTIMIZATION; SENSITIVITY; CALIBRATION; ALGORITHMS,,ASCE-AMER SOC CIVIL ENGINEERS,RESTON,"1801 ALEXANDER BELL DR, RESTON, VA 20191-4400 USA",1084-0699,1943-5584,,J HYDROL ENG,J.

113,Improving Snow Analyses for Hydrological Forecasting at ECCC Using Satellite-Derived Data,"As part of the National Hydrological Services Transformation Initiative, Environment and Climate Change Canada (ECCC) designed and implemented the National Surface and River Prediction System (NSRPS) in order to provide surface and river flow analysis and forecast products across Canada. Within NSRPS, the Canadian Land Data Assimilation System (CaLDAS) produces snow analyses that are used to initialise the land surface model, which in turn is used to force the river routing component. Originally, CaLDAS was designed to improve atmospheric forecasts with less focus on hydrological processes. When snow data assimilation occurs, the related increments remove/add water from/to the system, which can sometimes be problematic for streamflow forecasting, in particular during the snowmelt period. In this study, a new snow analysis method introduces multiple innovations that respond to the need for higher quality snow analyses for hydrological purposes, including the use of IMS snow cover extent data instead of in situ snow depth observations. The results show that the new snow assimilation methodology brings an overall improvement to snow analyses and substantially enhances water conservation, which is reflected in the generally improved streamflow simulations. This work represents a first step towards a new snow data assimilation process in CaLDAS, with the final objective of producing a reliable snow analysis to initialise and improve NWP as well as environmental predictions, including flood and drought forecasts.",https://doi.org/10.3390/rs13245022,10.3390/rs13245022,"Garnaud, Camille; Vionnet, Vincent; Gaborit, Etienne; Fortin, Vincent; Bilodeau, Bernard; Carrera, Marco; Durnford, Dorothy",REMOTE SENSING,snow analyses; water conservation; streamflow forecasting; assimilation,PRECIPITATION ANALYSIS; COVERED AREA; ASSIMILATION; PERFORMANCE; DEPTH; MODIS; PERTURBATION; SIMULATIONS; IMPROVEMENT; VEGETATION,,MDPI,BASEL,"ST ALBAN-ANLAGE 66, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND",,2072-4292,,REMOTE SENS-BASEL,Remote Sens.,DEC,2021,13,24,,,5022,
114,Streamflow Forecasting via Two Types of Predictive Structure-Based Gated Recurrent Unit Models,"Data-intelligent methods designed for forecasting the streamflow of the Fenhe River are crucial for enhancing water resource management. Herein, the gated recurrent unit (GRU) is coupled with the optimization algorithm improved grey wolf optimizer (IGWO) to design a hybrid model (IGWO-GRU) to carry out streamflow forecasting. Two types of predictive structure-based models (sequential IGWO-GRU and monthly IGWO-GRU) are compared with other models, such as the single least-squares support vector machine (LSSVM) and single extreme learning machine (ELM) models. These models incorporate the historical streamflow series as inputs of the model to forecast the future streamflow with data from January 1956 to December 2016 at the Shangjingyou station and from January 1958 to December 2016 at the Fenhe reservoir station. The IGWO-GRU model exhibited a strong ability for mapping in streamflow series when the parameters were carefully tuned. The monthly predictive structure can effectively extract the instinctive hydrological information that is more easily learned by the predictive model than the traditional sequential predictive structure. The monthly IGWO-GRU model was found to be a better forecasting tool, with an average qualification rate of 91.66% in two stations. It also showed good performance in absolute error and peak flow forecasting.",https://doi.org/10.3390/w13010091,10.3390/w13010091,"Zhao, Xuehua; Lv, Hanfang; Wei, Yizhao; Lv, Shujin; Zhu, Xueping",WATER,gated recurrent unit; improved grey wolf optimizer; monthly streamflow forecasting; data-driven modeling,,,MDPI,BASEL,"ST ALBAN-ANLAGE 66, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND",,2073-4441,,WATER-SUI,Water,JAN,2021,13,1,,,91,
115,Assessing the impacts of future climate change on the hydroclimatology of the Gediz Basin in Turkey by using dynamically downscaled CMIP5 projections,"The Gediz Basin is a Mediterranean watershed along the Aegean coast of Turkey, in which the most important economic activity is agriculture. Over the last few decades, this basin has been experiencing water-related problems such as water scarcity and competing use of water. This study assesses the impact of future climate change on the availability of water resources in the Gediz Basin during the 21st century by investigating the inflows into the major reservoir in the basin, Demirkopru Reservoir, which is the major source of irrigation water to the basin. The analysis in this study involves setting up a coupled hydro-climate model over the Gediz Basin by coupling the Weather Research and Forecasting (WRF) model to the physically-based Watershed Environmental Hydrology (WEHY) model. First, the WRF model is used to reconstruct the historical climatic variables over the basin by dynamically downscaling the ERA-Interim reanalysis dataset The calibrated and validated WRF model is then used to dynamically downscale eight different future climate projections over the Gediz Basin to a much finer resolution (6 km), which is more appropriate for the hydrologic modeling of the basin. These climate projections are from four Coupled Model Intercomparison Project Phase 5 (CMIP5) Global Climate Models (GCMs), namely, CCSM4, GFDL-ESM2M, HadGEM2-ES, and MIROC5, under two IPCC (The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change) representative concentration pathway scenarios (RCP4.5 and RCP8.5). The outputs from the WRF model are then input into the WEHY model, which is calibrated and validated over the basin, to simulate the hydrological processes within the basin and to obtain the projected future inflows into the Demirkopru Reservoir. Results of the future analysis over the 21st century (2017-2100) are then compared to the historical values (1985-2012) to investigate the impacts of future climate change on the hydroclimatology of the Gediz Basin.

116,A performance-based multi-model combination approach to reduce uncertainty in seasonal temperature change projections,"Future changes in climate variable exhibit prominent impact on flood magnitudes, crop yields, and freshwater withdrawal. Researchers typically ignore the large degree of uncertainty translated from climate projections to the estimated climate change magnitudes while applying pre-processing approaches on climate change projections. General Circulation Models (GCM) exhibit substantial uncertainty in projecting future changes in the seasonal temperature, which is evaluated by estimating the shift in either the mean or variance. Bias between the observed changes (1950-1999) and GCM simulated changes vary across models, climate regions, seasons, and under emission scenarios. The simplest approach to reduce model structural uncertainty, equal weighting of GCMs, does not consider superiority of one or multiple GCMs compared to the rest. The current study adopts a performance-based model combination approach that has shown efficiency in streamflow and weather forecasting, and GCM precipitation simulation. The optimal model combination approach has been modified to combine multi-model climate change information, while yielding the spatial correlation in climate change information within a geographic region. The optimal model combination approach, along with a simple bias-correction, is applied on 10 GCMs over nine climate regions across the coterminous United States (CONUS). We found that the optimal combination exhibits lower RMSE values as compared to the equal combination. Correlations between the model combined projections under optimal combination and the observed changes are strong and positive (>0.5). Future (2000-49) model combined projections exhibit an increase in the mean seasonal temperature by 2 degrees C for winter and by 1 degrees C for summer over almost all climate regions.",https://doi.org/10.1002/joc.6870,10.1002/joc.6870,"Das Bhowmik, Rajarshi; Sankarasubramanian, Arumugam",INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF CLIMATOLOGY,climate change; equal weighting; GCM; genetic algorithm; model combination; seasonal temperature,CLIMATE-CHANGE; STREAMFLOW FORECASTS; GENERAL-CIRCULATION; UNITED-STATES; PRECIPITATION; MODELS; VARIABILITY; CMIP5; SIMULATIONS; PREDICTIONS,,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0899-8418,1097-0088,,INT J CLIMATOL,Int.

117,A Method of Multi-Stage Reservoir Water Level Forecasting Systems: A Case Study of Techi Hydropower in Taiwan,"Reservoirs in Taiwan often provide hydroelectric power, irrigation water, municipal water, and flood control for the whole year. Taiwan has the climatic characteristics of concentrated rainy seasons, instantaneous heavy rains due to typhoons and rainy seasons. In addition, steep rivers in mountainous areas flow fast and furiously. Under such circumstances, reservoirs have to face sudden heavy rainfall and surges in water levels within a short period of time, which often causes the water level to continue to rise to the full level even though hydroelectric units are operating at full capacity, and as reservoirs can only drain the flood water, this results in the waste of hydropower resources. In recent years, the impact of climate change has caused extreme weather events to occur more frequently, increasing the need for flood control, and the reservoir operation has faced severe challenges in order to fulfil its multipurpose requirements. Therefore, in order to avoid the waste of hydropower resources and improve the effectiveness of the reservoir operation, this paper proposes a real-time 48-h ahead water level forecasting system, based on fuzzy neural networks with multi-stage architecture. The proposed multi-stage architecture provides reservoir inflow estimation, 48-h ahead reservoir inflow forecasting, and 48-h ahead water level forecasting. The proposed method has been implemented at the Techi hydropower plant in Taiwan. Experimental results show that the proposed method can effectively increase energy efficiency and allow the reservoir water resources to be fully utilized. In addition, the proposed method can improve the effectiveness of the hydropower plant, especially when rain is heavy.",https://doi.org/10.3390/en14123461,10.3390/en14123461,"Tsao, Hao-Han; Leu, Yih-Guang; Chou, Li-Fen; Tsao, Chao-Yang",ENERGIES,hydropower; reservoir water level forecasting; multi-stage architecture,FUZZY-NEURAL CONTROL; CLIMATE-CHANGE; STREAMFLOW PREDICTION; RIVER; NETWORKS; IMPACTS; PLANT,,MDPI,BASEL,"ST ALBAN-ANLAGE 66, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND",,1996-1073,,ENERGIES,Energies,JUN,2021,14,12,,,3461,
118,A new soft computing model for daily streamflow forecasting,"Accurate stream flow quantification and prediction are essential for the local and global planning and management of basins to cope with climate change. The ability to forecast streamflow is crucial, as it can help mitigate flood risks. Long-term stream flow data records are needed for hydropower plant construction, flood prediction, watershed management, and long-term water supply use. An accurate assessment of streamflow is considered as very challenging and critical tasks. A new predicting model is developed in this research, combining the technique of sunflower optimization (SFA) as an evolutionary algorithm with the multi-layer perceptron (MLP) algorithm to predict streamflow in Malaysia's Jam Seyed Omar (JSO) and Muda Di Jeniang (MDJ) stations. Principal component analysis (PCA) was performed on Q (t) (t: the number of the current day) before model creation to pick essential inputs for a maximum of 6 lags. With the classical MLP and two other hybrid MLP models (MLP-particle swarm optimization (MLP-PSO) and MLP-genetic algorithm (MLP-GA)), the results of the MLP-sunflower algorithm (SFA) were benchmarked. As compared to other models, the MLP-SFA could be able to reduce the Root Mean Square Error (RMSE) by a value of between 12 and 21% at the JSO station and between 8 and 24% at the MDJ station. In conclusion, this research found that combining MLP with optimization algorithms improved the precision of the stand-alone MLP model, with SFA integration being the most efficient.",https://doi.org/10.1007/s00477-021-02012-1,10.1007/s00477-021-02012-1,"Sammen, Saad Sh.; Ehteram, Mohammad; Abba, S.

119,A Forecast-Based Operation(FBO) Mode for Reservoir Flood Control Using Forecast Cumulative Net Rainfall,"With advance of up-to-date hydrology measuring and forecasting system, reservoir operations are no longer required to be as conservative as they once were. The incorporation of flood inflow and weather forecasts allows for greater flexibility in the management of reservoir space and inherently increases opportunities for acquiring additional water supply and reducing flood risks effectively advance. In this paper, taking Ankang Reservoir as an example, a forecast-based operation (FBO) mode for flood control is developed with cumulative net rainfall in the real-time rolling prediction as the primary indicator and the water level in the reservoir as the auxiliary indicator. Based on the accuracy of flood forecasting data, FBO rules for reservoir flood control are formulated by using the stepwise regulation method considering the actual situation of Ankang Reservoir. For verification, a flood routing simulation is conducted for designed and typical flood processes with different recurrence intervals using the formulated rules. The results show that the maximum flood level is lower than for conventional regulation and that the duration of the maximum discharge under the forecast operation mode is slightly shorter than the conventional discharge, which indicates that the flood risk is reduced to some extent by applying the formulated FBO rules and, correspondingly, demonstrates the merits and applicability of implementing FBO mode for Ankang reservoir.",https://doi.org/10.1007/s11269-019-02267-y,10.1007/s11269-019-02267-y,"Wang, Xiao; Liu, Zhao; Zhou, Weibo; Jia, Zhifeng; You, Qiying",WATER RESOURCES MANAGEMENT,Flood control; Reservoir; Forecast-based operation; Cumulative net rainfall; Water level,UNIVARIATE MODEL; SYSTEM,,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0920-4741,1573-1650,,WATER RESOUR MANAG,Water Resour.

120,Predictive modelling of eutrophication in the Pozn de la Dolores lake (Northern Spain) by using an evolutionary support vector machines approach,"Eutrophication is a water enrichment in nutrients (mainly phosphorus) that generally leads to symptomatic changes and deterioration of water quality and all its uses in general, when the production of algae and other aquatic vegetations are increased. In this sense, eutrophication has caused a variety of impacts, such as high levels of Chlorophyll a (Chl-a). Consequently, anticipate its presence is a matter of importance to prevent future risks. The aim of this study was to obtain a predictive model able to perform an early detection of the eutrophication in water bodies such as lakes. This study presents a novel hybrid algorithm, based on support vector machines (SVM) approach in combination with the particle swarm optimization (PSO) technique, for predicting the eutrophication from biological and physical-chemical input parameters determined experimentally through sampling and subsequent analysis in a certificate laboratory. This optimization technique involves hyperparameter setting in the SVM training procedure, which significantly influences the regression accuracy. The results of the present study are twofold. In the first place, the significance of each biological and physical-chemical variables on the eutrophication is presented through the model. Secondly, a model for forecasting eutrophication is obtained with success. Indeed, regression with optimal hyperparameters was performed and coefficients of determination equal to 0.90 for the Total phosphorus estimation and 0.92 for the Chlorophyll concentration were obtained when this hybrid PSO-SVM-based model was applied to the experimental dataset, respectively. The agreement between experimental data and the model confirmed the good performance of the latter.",https://doi.org/10.1007/s00285-017-1161-2,10.1007/s00285-017-1161-2,"Garcia-Nieto, P.

The downscaled atmospheric data were then used to drive the watershed environmental hydrology (WEHY) model, a fully physically-based hydrologic model, over the Gediz Basin in order to obtain the total amount of water inflows into the basin's major reservoir. Historical period inflows (1985-2012) were compared to the future projections of reservoir inflows (2017-2100). Trends in annual inflow projections were also analyzed.

This study proposes a novel data-driven framework to forecast water quality profiles over long time periods in Boulder Basin of Lake Mead, a deep monomictic subtropical lake. Hourly meteorological data were used to estimate lake-atmosphere heat exchange. Heat fluxes combined with 6-hourly measured water quality profiles up to 106 m depth were used to train six different artificial neural networks to forecast water temperature, dissolved oxygen, and conductivity profiles up to 240 d ahead. A model incorporating heat fluxes, winds, and stationary wavelet decomposition generated correlation coefficients > 0.88 and relative errors < 4% throughout the water column for up to 240-d ahead forecasts. Internal wave motions at the thermocline resulted in larger relative errors of forecasts in the metalimnion compared to other depths. Greater atmospheric influences on water temperature and dissolved oxygen resulted in larger forecast errors compared to conductivity. An autocovariance method successfully determined appropriate forecasting lead times at different depths, improving forecast accuracies.",https://doi.org/10.1002/lno.11390,10.1002/lno.11390,"Saber, Ali; James, David E.; Hayes, Donald F.",LIMNOLOGY AND OCEANOGRAPHY,,PREDICTION; VARIABLES; BOUNDARY; DYNAMICS; FLUXES; MODEL,,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0024-3590,1939-5590,,LIMNOL OCEANOGR,Limnol.

123,Medium-term storage volume prediction for optimum reservoir management: A hybrid data-driven approach,"A hybrid regressive and probabilistic model was developed that is able to forecast, six weeks ahead, the storage volume of Little Nerang dam. This is a small elevated Australian drinking water reservoir, gravity fed to a nearby water treatment plant while a lower second main water supply source (Hinze dam) requires considerable pumping. The model applies a Monte Carlo approach combined with nonlinear threshold autoregressive models using the seasonal streamflow forecasts from the Bureau of Meteorology as input and it was validated over different historical conditions. Treatment operators can use the model for quantifying depletion rates and spill likelihood for the forthcoming six weeks, based on the seasonal climatic conditions and different intake scenarios. Greater utilization of the Little Nerang reservoir source means a reduced supply requirement from the Hinze dam source that needs considerable energy costs for pumping, leading to a lower cost water supply solution for the region.

124,A novel hybrid model for water quality prediction based on synchrosqueezed wavelet transform technique and improved long short-term memory,"Predicting water quality accurately is of utmost importance in water resource management. This study focuses on the prediction of water quality parameters such as the dissolved oxygen (DO) in the watershed system. The traditional recurrent neural networks (RNNs) suffer from gradient disappearance or explosion and inability to solve the problem of long-time dependence, and their practical applications are limited. To overcome this drawback, an improved long short-term memory (LSTM) model was proposed to improve the model's performance. In addition, to overcome nonstationarity, randomness, and nonlinearity of the water quality parameters data, a hybrid model that recruits synchrosqueezed wavelet transform (SWT) to denoise the original data was adopted. A novel metaheuristic optimization algorithm, the improved sparrow search algorithm (ISSA) combining Cauchy mutation and opposition-based learning (OBL) was also implemented to compute the optimal parameter values for the LSTM model. The proposed hybrid model was evaluated using an original weekly water quality parameters series, from 1/2010-12/2016, measured at the Yongding River and Gangnan gauging stations in the Haihe River Basin, China. The standalone LSTM, ISSA-LSTM, SWT-LSTM, support vector regression (SVR), and back propagation neural network (BPNN) were adopted as comparative forecast models using the same dataset. The results demonstrate that the addressed model, combining the strong noise-resistant robustness of the SWT and the nonlinear mapping of the LSTM, has the best prediction performance among the peer models at two gauging stations. The proposed hybrid model can be used as an alternative framework for water quality prediction, which can provide decision-making basis for comprehensive water quality management and pollutant control in the basin.",https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jhydrol.2021.126879,10.1016/j.jhydrol.2021.126879,"Song, Chenguang; Yao, Leihua; Hua, Chengya; Ni, Qihang",JOURNAL OF HYDROLOGY,SWT; ISSA; Water quality prediction; Ensemble learning; Hybrid model,RIVER-BASINS,,ELSEVIER,AMSTERDAM,"RADARWEG 29, 1043 NX AMSTERDAM, NETHERLANDS",0022-1694,1879-2707,,J HYDROL,J.

125,Linking multi-media modeling with machine learning to assess and predict lake chlorophyll a concentrations,"Eutrophication and excessive algal growth pose a threat on aquatic organisms and the health of the public, environment, and the economy. Understanding what drives excessive algal growth can inform mitigation measures and aid in advance planning to minimize impacts. We demonstrate how simulated data from weather, hydrological, and agroecosystem numerical prediction models can be combined with machine learning (ML) to assess and predict chlorophyll a (chl a) concentrations, a proxy for lake eutrophication and algal biomass. The study area is Lake Erie for a 16-year period, 2002-2017. A total of 20 environmental variables from linked and coupled physical models are used as input features to train the ML model with chl a observations from 16 measuring stations. Included are meteorological variables from the Weather Research and Forecasting (WRF) model, hydrological variables from the Variable Infiltration Capacity (VIC) model, and agricultural management practice variables from the Environmental Policy Integrated Climate (EPIC) agroecosystem model. The consolidation of these variables is conducive to a successful prediction of chl a. Aside from the synergistic effects that weather, hydrology, and fertilizers have on eutrophication and excessive algal growth, we found that the application of different forms of both P and N fertilizers are highly ranked for the prediction of chl a concentration. The developed ML model successfully predicts chl a with a coefficient of determination of 0.81, bias of -0.12 lg/l and RMSE of 4.97 lg/l.

126,Operational hydrometeorological forecast at EDF-DTG-recent progress and current situation in 2018,"To help managing the floods but also to optimize its hydroelectric production, EDF set up internal hydrometeorological centers in the 1970s to monitor flows and produce hydrometeorological forecasts. Since their creation, these centers have seen their activity evolve, integrating new challenges over the years, taking advantage of methodological advances made, implementing new organizations while developing new distribution supports and improving communication. The first step of the operational forecast chain is the analysis of observation data, either climatologic or hydrologic. Then, after a study of the meteorological context, allowing the forecasters to evaluate the uncertainties, they build a precipitation and air temperature scenario to feed the hydrological model. Through this rainfall-runoff model, a streamflow forecast is obtained, that can still be expertized before diffusion to the end-user. Probabilistic daily forecasts at 14 days, statistically calibrated, are automatically elaborated. Then, these are refined by deformation of distribution's synthetic variables. Very useful for various uses, these forecasts allow, a minima, an anticipated detection of a flood event risk of occurrence. In most cases, daily streamfiow forecast is sufficient for reservoir volume management, but in case of a rapid evolution, the hourly forecast can be helpful. Thus, the generalization of hourly flow forecast is a major stake for EDF. It results in: (i) the design of an hydrological model adapted to this time step, whose free parameters are then calibrated on more than 200 catchments; and (ii) an enriched communication to represent uncertainties on flood dynamic, volumes, gradients and maximal values of forecasted streamfiow. The hourly forecasts are then widely diffused to the end-users. At the same time, in 2008, a precise communication protocol, based on probabilities, has been conceived by EDF to warn in anticipation the dam managers of a potential threshold overrun. Thus, the expressions Fort Risque (greater risk) and Risque (risk) were used, communicated and explained, and are today an integral part of the diffused information. So, the hydrometeorological forecast is in permanent evolution at EDF. The next challenges are (i) the realization of expertized probabilistic hourly forecasts and (ii) the production of a more significant number of forecasts (currently 30,000 forecasts a year) answering the end-user expectations, mainly in flood period.",https://doi.org/10.1051/lhb/2019014,10.1051/lhb/2019014,"Moulin, Letitia; Abonnel, Alain; Puygrenier, Damien; Valery, Audrey; Garcon, Remy",HOUILLE BLANCHE-REVUE INTERNATIONALE DE L EAU,real-time streamflow forecast; floods; flow monitoring; probabilistic forecasts; hourly forecast; communication of information,,,EDP SCIENCES S A,LES ULIS CEDEX A,"17, AVE DU HOGGAR, PA COURTABOEUF, BP 112, F-91944 LES ULIS CEDEX A, FRANCE",0018-6368,1958-5551,,HOUILLE BLANCHE,Houille Blanche-Rev.

127,Projected impacts of climate change on stream salmonids with implications for resilience-based management,"The sustainability of freshwater fisheries is increasingly affected by climate warming, habitat alteration, invasive species and other drivers of global change. The State of Michigan, USA, contains ecologically, socioeconomically valuable coldwater stream salmonid fisheries that are highly susceptible to these ecological alterations. Thus, there is a need for future management approaches that promote resilient stream ecosystems that absorb change amidst disturbances. Fisheries professionals in Michigan are responding to this need by designing a comprehensive management plan for stream brook charr (Salvelinus fontinalis), brown trout (Salmo trutta) and rainbow trout (Oncorhynchus mykiss) populations. To assist in developing such a plan, we used stream-specific regression models to forecast thermal habitat suitability in streams throughout Michigan from 2006 to 2056 under different predicted climate change scenarios. As baseflow index (i.e., relative groundwater input) increased, stream thermal sensitivity (i.e., relative susceptibility to temperature change) decreased. Thus, the magnitude of temperature warming and frequency of thermal habitat degradation were lowest in streams with the highest baseflow indices. Thermal habitats were most suitable in rainbow trout streams as this species has a wider temperature range for growth (12.0-22.5 degrees C) compared to brook charr (11.0-20.5 degrees C) and brown trout (12.0-20.0 degrees C). Our study promotes resilience-based salmonid management by providing a methodology for stream temperature and thermal habitat suitability prediction. Fisheries professionals can use this approach to protect coldwater habitats and drivers of stream cooling and ultimately conserve resilient salmonid populations amidst global change.",https://doi.org/10.1111/eff.12267,10.1111/eff.12267,"Carlson, Andrew K.; Taylor, William W.; Schlee, Kelsey M.; Zorn, Troy G.; Infante, Dana M.",ECOLOGY OF FRESHWATER FISH,brook charr; brown trout; rainbow trout; Michigan; temperature; resilience,GROUNDWATER TEMPERATURE RESPONSE; LAURENTIAN GREAT-LAKES; WATER TEMPERATURE; SALVELINUS-FONTINALIS; BROOK CHARR; MICHIGAN; GROWTH; TROUT; RIVER; HABITAT,,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0906-6691,1600-0633,,ECOL FRESHW FISH,Ecol.

128,State updating and calibration period selection to improve dynamic monthly streamflow forecasts for an environmental flow management application,"Monthly to seasonal streamflow forecasts provide useful information for a range of water resource management and planning applications. This work focuses on improving such forecasts by considering the following two aspects: (1) state updating to force the models to match observations from the start of the forecast period, and (2) selection of a shorter calibration period that is more representative of the forecast period, compared to a longer calibration period traditionally used. The analysis is undertaken in the context of using streamflow forecasts for environmental flow water management of an open channel drainage network in southern Australia. Forecasts of monthly streamflow are obtained using a conceptual rainfall-runoff model combined with a post-processor error model for uncertainty analysis. This model set-up is applied to two catchments, one with stronger evidence of non-stationarity than the other. A range of metrics are used to assess different aspects of predictive performance, including reliability, sharpness, bias and accuracy. The results indicate that, for most scenarios and metrics, state updating improves predictive performance for both observed rainfall and forecast rainfall sources. Using the shorter calibration period also improves predictive performance, particularly for the catchment with stronger evidence of non-stationarity. The results highlight that a traditional approach of using a long calibration period can degrade predictive performance when there is evidence of non-stationarity. The techniques presented can form the basis for operational monthly streamflow forecasting systems and provide support for environmental decision-making.",https://doi.org/10.5194/hess-22-871-2018,10.5194/hess-22-871-2018,"Gibbs, Matthew S.; McInerney, David; Humphrey, Greer; Thyer, Mark A.; Maier, Holger R.; Dandy, Graeme C.; Kavetski, Dmitri",HYDROLOGY AND EARTH SYSTEM SCIENCES,,RAINFALL-RUNOFF MODELS; DATA ASSIMILATION; UNCERTAINTY; IMPACT; SKILL; STATIONARITY; PERFORMANCE; PREDICTION; MOISTURE; RIVER,,COPERNICUS GESELLSCHAFT MBH,GOTTINGEN,"BAHNHOFSALLEE 1E, GOTTINGEN, 37081, GERMANY",1027-5606,1607-7938,,HYDROL EARTH SYST SC,Hydrol.

129,"Lake Water-Level fluctuations forecasting using Minimax Probability Machine Regression, Relevance Vector Machine, Gaussian Process Regression, and Extreme Learning Machine","Forecasting freshwater lake levels is vital information for water resource management, including water supply management, shoreline management, hydropower generation optimization, and flood management. This study presents a novel application of four advanced artificial intelligence models namely the Minimax Probability Machine Regression (MPMR), Relevance Vector Machine (RVM), Gaussian Process Regression (GPR) and Extreme Learning Machine (ELM) for forecasting lake level fluctuation in Lake Huron utilizing historical datasets. The MPMR is a probabilistic framework that employed Mercer Kernels to achieve nonlinear regression models. The GPR, which is a probabilistic technique used tractable Bayesian framework for generalization of multivariate distribution of input samples to vast dimensional space. The ELM is a capable algorithm-based model for the implementation of the single-layer feed-forward neural network. The RVM demonstrate depends on the specification of the Bayesian method on a linear model with proper preceding that results in demonstration of sparse. The recommended techniques were tested to evaluate the current lake water-level trend monthly from the historical datasets at four previous time steps. The Lake Huron levels from 1918 to 1993 was managed for the training phase, and the rest of data (from 1994 to 2013) was used for testing. Considering the monthly and annually previous time steps, six models were introduced and found that the best results are achieved for a model with (t-1, t-2, t-3, t-12) as input combinations. The results show that all models can forecast the lake levels precisely. The results of this research study exhibit that the MPMR model (R-2 = 0.984; MAE = 0.035; RMSE = 0.044; E-NS = 0.984; D-Refined = 0.995; E-LM = 0.874) found to be more precise in lake level forecasting.

In this study, an artificial neural network model (ANN) was followed for determining the water quality index parameters. By the use of computer program, we can get a set of coefficients for a linear model in the calibration of ANN model. The Palayar River is one of the oldest rivers in Tamil Nadu originating from Western Ghats and flowing through Suchinthram area and Parakai Lake. Seven water quality parameters of Parakai Lake were chosen at four monitoring stations in the time period between December 2016 and March 2018.

131,Optimized BP neural network for Dissolved Oxygen prediction,"To solve the low accuracy, slow convergence and poor robustness problem of traditional neural network method for water quality forecasting, a new model of dissolved oxygen content prediction is proposed based on sliding window, particle swarm optimization (PSO) and BP neural network. dissolved oxygen content prediction model in water quality is established by handling dissolved oxygen content data through sliding window, and using particle swarm optimization algorithm to obtain BP neural network parameters. This model is applied to prediction analysis of dissolved oxygen with online monitoring of regional groundwater in Xilin Gol League on July 25, 2017 to December 5, 2017. Experimental results show that the model has better prediction effect, and mean square error (MSE), root mean square error(RMSE), mean absolute error(MAE) value of PSO algorithm to optimize the BP neural network based on sliding window are 0.437% and 6.611%, 0.251% respectively, which are better than single forecasting method by using sliding window, PSO, and BP neural network individually. The Optimized BP neural network not only has fast convergence speed and high prediction accuracy, but also provides decision-making basis for water pollution control and water management.

132,High-resolution regional climate modeling and projection over western Canada using a weather research forecasting model with a pseudo-global warming approach,"Climate change poses great risks to western Canada's ecosystem and socioeconomical development. To assess these hydroclimatic risks under high-end emission scenario RCP8.5, this study used the Weather Research Forecasting (WRF) model at a convection-permitting (CP) 4 km resolution to dynamically downscale the mean projection of a 19-member CMIP5 ensemble by the end of the 21st century. The CP simulations include a retrospective simulation (CTL, 2000-2015) for verification forced by ERA-Interim and a pseudo-global warming (PGW) for climate change projection forced with climate change forcing (2071-2100 to 1976-2005) from CMIP5 ensemble added on ERA-Interim. The retrospective WRF-CTL's surface air temperature simulation was evaluated against Canadian daily analysis ANUS-PLIN, showing good agreements in the geographical distribution with cold biases east of the Canadian Rockies, especially in spring. WRF-CTL captures the main pattern of observed precipitation distribution from CaPA and ANUS-PLIN but shows a wet bias near the British Columbia coast in winter and over the immediate region on the lee side of the Canadian Rockies. The WRF-PGW simulation shows significant warming relative to CTL, especially over the polar region in the northeast during the cold season, and in daily minimum temperature. Precipitation changes in PGW over CTL vary with the seasons: in spring and late autumn precipitation increases in most areas, whereas in summer in the Saskatchewan River basin and southern Canadian Prairies, the precipitation change is negligible or decreased slightly. With almost no increase in precipitation and much more evapotranspiration in the future, the water availability during the growing season will be challenging for the Canadian Prairies. The WRF-PGW projected warming is less than that by the CMIP5 ensemble in all seasons. The CMIP5 ensemble projects a 10 %-20% decrease in summer precipitation over the Canadian Prairies and generally agrees with WRF-PGW except for regions with significant terrain. This difference may be due to the much higher resolution of WRF being able to more faithfully represent small-scale summer convection and orographic lifting due to steep terrain. WRF-PGW shows an increase in high-intensity precipitation events and shifts the distribution of precipitation events toward more extremely intensive events in all seasons. Due to this shift in precipitation intensity to the higher end in the PGW simulation, the seemingly moderate increase in the total amount of precipitation in summer east of the Canadian Rockies may underestimate the increase in flooding risk and water shortage for agriculture. The change in the probability distribution of precipitation intensity also calls for innovative bias-correction methods to be developed for the application of the dataset when bias correction is required. High-quality meteorological observation over the region is needed for both forcing high-resolution climate simulation and conducting verification. The high-resolution downscaled climate simulations provide abundant opportunities both for investigating local-scale atmospheric dynamics and for studying climate impacts on hydrology, agriculture, and ecosystems.",https://doi.org/10.5194/hess-23-4635-2019,10.5194/hess-23-4635-2019,"Li, Yanping; Li, Zhenhua; Zhang, Zhe; Chen, Liang; Kurkute, Sopan; Scaff, Lucia; Pan, Xicai",HYDROLOGY AND EARTH SYSTEM SCIENCES,,PRECIPITATION; TEMPERATURE; IMPLEMENTATION; MICROPHYSICS; SIMULATIONS; INCREASES; EXTREMES; IMPACTS; SYSTEM,,COPERNICUS GESELLSCHAFT MBH,GOTTINGEN,"BAHNHOFSALLEE 1E, GOTTINGEN, 37081, GERMANY",1027-5606,1607-7938,,HYDROL EARTH SYST SC,Hydrol.

133,Water Temperature Ensemble Forecasts: Implementation Using the CEQUEAU Model on Two Contrasted River Systems,"In some hydrological systems, mitigation strategies are applied based on short-range water temperature forecasts to reduce stress caused to aquatic organisms. While various uncertainty sources are known to affect thermal modeling, their impact on water temperature forecasts remain poorly understood. The objective of this paper is to characterize uncertainty induced to water temperature forecasts by meteorological inputs in two hydrological contexts. Daily ensemble water temperature forecasts were produced using the CEQUEAU model for the Nechako (regulated) and Southwest Miramichi (natural) Rivers for 1-5-day horizons. The results demonstrate that a larger uncertainty is propagated to the thermal forecast in the unregulated river (0.92-3.14 degrees C) than on the regulated river (0.73-2.29 degrees C). Better performances were observed on the Nechako with a mean continuous ranked probability score (MCRPS) <0.85 degrees C for all horizons compared to the Southwest Miramichi (MCRPS approximate to 1 degrees C). While informing the end-user on future thermal conditions, the ensemble forecasts provide an assessment of the associated uncertainty and offer an additional tool to river managers for decision-making.",https://doi.org/10.3390/w9070457,10.3390/w9070457,"Ouellet-Proulx, Sebastien; St-Hilaire, Andre; Boucher, Marie-Amelie",WATER,water temperature; modeling; uncertainty; ensemble forecasts; river management; regulated river,FISHERIES MANAGEMENT; STREAM; PREDICTION; PRECIPITATION; VERIFICATION; UNCERTAINTY; REGIMES; CANADA,,MDPI AG,BASEL,"ST ALBAN-ANLAGE 66, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND",2073-4441,,,WATER-SUI,Water,JUL,2017,9,7,,,457,
134,Using MODIS estimates of fractional snow cover area to improve streamflow forecasts in interior Alaska,"Remotely sensed snow cover observations provide an opportunity to improve operational snowmelt and streamflow forecasting in remote regions. This is particularly true in Alaska, where remote basins and a spatially and temporally sparse gaging network plague efforts to understand and forecast the hydrology of subarctic boreal basins and where climate change is leading to rapid shifts in basin function. In this study, the operational framework employed by the United States (US) National Weather Service, including the Alaska Pacific River Forecast Center, is adapted to integrate Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) remotely sensed observations of fractional snow cover area (fSCA) to determine if these data improve streamflow forecasts in interior Alaska river basins. Two versions of MODIS fSCA are tested against a base case extent of snow cover derived by aerial depletion curves: the MODIS 10A1 (MOD10A1) and the MODIS Snow Cover Area and Grain size (MODSCAG) product over the period 2000-2010. Observed runoff is compared to simulated runoff to calibrate both iterations of the model. MODIS-forced simulations have improved snow depletion timing compared with snow telemetry sites in the basins, with discernable increases in skill for the streamflow simulations. The MODSCAG fSCA version provides moderate increases in skill but is similar to the MOD10A1 results. The basins with the largest improvement in streamflow simulations have the sparsest streamflow observations. Considering the numerous low-quality gages (discontinuous, short, or unreliable) and ungauged systems throughout the high-latitude regions of the globe, this result is valuable and indicates the utility of the MODIS fSCA data in these regions. Additionally, while improvements in predicted discharge values are subtle, the snow model better represents the physical conditions of the snowpack and therefore provides more robust simulations, which are consistent with the US National Weather Service's move toward a physically based National Water Model. Physically based models may also be more capable of adapting to changing climates than statistical models corrected to past regimes. This work provides direction for both the Alaska Pacific River Forecast Center and other forecast centers across the US to implement remote-sensing observations within their operational framework, to refine the representation of snow, and to improve streamflow forecasting skill in basins with few or poor-quality observations.",https://doi.org/10.5194/hess-23-2439-2019,10.5194/hess-23-2439-2019,"Bennett, Katrina E.; Cherry, Jessica E.; Balk, Ben; Lindsey, Scott",HYDROLOGY AND EARTH SYSTEM SCIENCES,,LAND-SURFACE MODEL; RIVER-ICE BREAKUP; CLIMATE-CHANGE; SOLID PRECIPITATION; HYDROLOGICAL MODEL; DATA ASSIMILATION; DEPLETION CURVES; NORTHERN ALASKA; GAP FRACTIONS; WATER,,COPERNICUS GESELLSCHAFT MBH,GOTTINGEN,"BAHNHOFSALLEE 1E, GOTTINGEN, 37081, GERMANY",1027-5606,1607-7938,,HYDROL EARTH SYST SC,Hydrol.

135,Three-Phase-Based Approach to Develop a River Health Prediction and Early Warning System to Guide River Management,"To effectively manage a river system, systematic tracking and diagnosing the change and risks of a river system are essentially required to efficiently conserve or restore its conditions. Hence, this study focuses on how to integrate current status assessment, trend prediction, and cause diagnosis in river health to guide early warning decision-making in river protection and management. This study has presented a three-phase approach by coupling spatial with nonspatial information in a highly systematic and reliable way, and an early warning system has been designed. In phase I, the current health status is assessed and nowcasted by using the order degree of each indicator. In phase II, health predictors, including the single perspective-based health index (HI) (e.g., water quality index (WQI) and index of biotic integrity (IBI)) and multi-perspective-based health index, have been forecasted under normal conditions or emerging conditions using predictive models. In phase III, key causal factors threatening the river health have been identified to enable early notification and to address unexpected events before occurrence. Although different modeling methods can be used in each phase to demonstrate this concept, we tested the model of partial least square regression (PLSR) associated with time series. Additionally, the three-phase approach has been integrated with geographic information system (GIS) and a decision support system (DSS) to develop a river health prediction and early warning system (RHP-EWS), an automatic prediction and decision-making tool. This tool was implemented to deal with the landing of typhoon Maria in 2018 into the Shanxi River watershed in China. Because of the timely responses and decisions, the drinking water supply was not influenced. However, the models should be extended to other river systems for testing and improvement at different temporal or spatial scales.",https://doi.org/10.3390/app9194163,10.3390/app9194163,"Chen, Yongming; Xia, Jihong; Cai, Wangwei; Sun, Zhilin; Dou, Chuanbing",APPLIED SCIENCES-BASEL,river health; trend prediction; key causal factor identification; early warning system; PLSR,WATER-QUALITY; BIOLOGICAL INTEGRITY; ECOSYSTEM HEALTH; MACROINVERTEBRATE; REGRESSION; MODELS; INDEX,,MDPI,BASEL,"ST ALBAN-ANLAGE 66, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND",,2076-3417,,APPL SCI-BASEL,Appl.

136,Variance analysis of forecasted streamflow maxima in a wet temperate climate,"Coupling global climate models, hydrologic models and extreme value analysis provides a method to forecast streamflow maxima, however the elusive variance structure of the results hinders confidence in application. Directly correcting the bias of forecasts using the relative change between forecast and control simulations has been shown to marginalize hydrologic uncertainty, reduce model bias, and remove systematic variance when predicting mean monthly and mean annual streamflow, prompting our investigation for maxima streamflow. We assess the variance structure of streamflow maxima using realizations of emission scenario, global climate model type and project phase, downscaling methods, bias correction, extreme value methods, and hydrologic model inputs and parameterization. Results show that the relative change of streamflow maxima was not dependent on systematic variance from the annual maxima versus peak over threshold method applied, albeit we stress that researchers strictly adhere to rules from extreme value theory when applying the peak over threshold method. Regardless of which method is applied, extreme value model fitting does add variance to the projection, and the variance is an increasing function of the return period. Unlike the relative change of mean streamflow, results show that the variance of the maxima's relative change was dependent on all climate model factors tested as well as hydrologic model inputs and calibration. Ensemble projections forecast an increase of streamflow maxima for 2050 with pronounced forecast standard error, including an increase of +30 (+/- 21), +38(+/- 34) and +51(+/- 85)% for 2, 20 and 100 year streamflow events for the wet temperate region studied. The variance of maxima projections was dominated by climate model factors and extreme value analyses. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V.

137,Calibration and quantifying uncertainty of daily water quality forecasts for large lakes with a Bayesian joint probability modelling approach,"Correcting the systematic bias and quantifying uncertainty associated with the operational water quality forecasts are imperative works for risk-based environmental decision making. This work proposes a post-processing method for addressing both bias correction and total uncertainty quantification for daily forecasts of water quality parameters derived from dynamical lake models. The post-processing is implemented based on a Bayesian Joint Probability (BJP) modeling approach. The BJP model uses a log-sinh transformation to normalize the raw forecasts and corresponding observations, and uses a bivariate Gaussian distribution to characterize the dependence relationship. The posterior distribution of the transformation parameters is inferenced through Metropolis Monte Carlo Markov chain sampling; it generates unbiased probabilistic forecasts that account for uncertainties from all sources. The BJP is used to post-processing raw daily forecasts of dissolved oxygen (DO), ammonium nitrogen (NH), total phosphorus (TP) and total nitrogen (TN) concentrations of Lake Chaohu, the fifth largest lake in China with lead times from 0 to 5 days. Results suggest that an average 93.1% forecast bias has been removed by BJP. The root mean square error in probability skill scores range from 5.8% for NH to 68.2% for TP, and the nonparametric bootstrapping test suggests that 67.7% forecasts are significantly improved averaged across all sampling sites, water quality parameters and lead times. The probabilities of the calibrated forecasts are reasonably consistent with the observed relative frequencies, and have appropriate spread and thus correctly quantify forecast uncertainty. The BJP post-processing method used in this study can be a useful operational tool that help to better realize the potential of water quality forecasts derived from dynamical models.

138,Linking variability in climate to wetland habitat suitability: is it possible to forecast regional responses from simple climate measures?,"Temporary wetlands have value to both ecological and social systems. Interactions between local climate and the surrounding landscape result in patterns of hydrology that are unique to temporary wetlands. These seasonal and annual fluctuations in wetland inundation contribute to community composition and richness. Thus, predicting wetland community responses to environmental change is tied to the ability to predict wetland hydroregime. Detailed monitoring of wetland hydroregime is resource-intensive, limiting the scope and scale of forecasting. As an alternative, we determine which freely available measures of water availability best predict one component of wetland hydroregime, habitat suitability (i.e., the predictability of water in a wetland) within and among geographic regions. We used data from three North American regions to determine the climate index that best explained year-to-year variation in habitat suitability during a key phenological periodamphibian breeding. We demonstrate that simple, short-term climate indices based solely on precipitation data best predict habitat suitability in vernal pools in the northeast, montane wetlands in the west and coastal plain wetlands in the southeast.

139,Application of Entropy Spectral Method for Streamflow Forecasting in Northwest China,"Streamflow forecasting is vital for reservoir operation, flood control, power generation, river ecological restoration, irrigation and navigation. Although monthly streamflow time series are statistic, they also exhibit seasonal and periodic patterns. Using maximum Burg entropy, maximum configurational entropy and minimum relative entropy, the forecasting models for monthly streamflow series were constructed for five hydrological stations in northwest China. The evaluation criteria of average relative error (RE), root mean square error (RMSE), correlation coefficient (R) and determination coefficient (DC) were selected as performance metrics. Results indicated that the RESA model had the highest forecasting accuracy, followed by the CESA model. However, the BESA model had the highest forecasting accuracy in a low-flow period, and the prediction accuracies of RESA and CESA models in the flood season were relatively higher. In future research, these entropy spectral analysis methods can further be applied to other rivers to verify the applicability in the forecasting of monthly streamflow in China.",https://doi.org/10.3390/e21020132,10.3390/e21020132,"Zhang, Gengxi; Zhou, Zhenghong; Su, Xiaoling; Ayantobo, Olusola O.",ENTROPY,burg entropy; configurational entropy; relative entropy; spectral analysis; streamflow forecasting,MINIMUM RELATIVE ENTROPY,,MDPI,BASEL,"ST ALBAN-ANLAGE 66, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND",1099-4300,,,ENTROPY-SWITZ,Entropy,FEB,2019,21,2,,,132,
140,Impacts of non-native fishes under a seasonal temperature gradient are forecasted using functional responses and abundances,"Developing predictive methods to forecast the impacts of existing and emerging invasive specks is of critical importance to biodiversity conservation. However, invader impacts are context-dependent, making reliable and robust predictions challenging. In particular, it is unclear how temporal variabilities in relation to temperature regime shifts influence invader ecological impacts. In the present study, we quantify the functional responses of three coexisting freshwater fishes: the native freshwater River Goby Glossogobius callidus, and the non-native Mozambique Tilapia Oreochromis mossambicus and Western Mosquitofish Gambusia affinis, under two temperature treatments using chironomid larvae as prey. This was used along with fish abundance data to determine temporal differences in ecological impacts of each fish species between seasons (i.e. at two corresponding temperatures). All three fish species exhibited potentially population-destabilizing Type II functional responses. Their maximum feeding rates were consistently higher in the warm temperature treatment, whereas attack rates tended to be reduced. Non-native Mozambique Tilapia had the highest maximum feeding rate under both temperature treatments (18 degrees C and 25 degrees C), followed by the non-native Western Mosquitofish and lastly the native River Goby, suggesting greater per capita impacts on native prey by non-native fishes. The predatory fish abundances differed significantly according to season, with native River Goby and non-native Mozambique Tilapia generally more abundant than non-native Western Mosquitofish. By multiplying functional response maximum feeding rates with abundances of each fish species across the seasonal gradient, the relative impact potential of non-native Mozambique Tilapia was consistently higher compared to that of native gobies. Western Mosquitofish impacts were less apparent, owing to their low abundances. We demonstrate how seasonal temperature fluctuations affect the relative impact capacities of introduced species and the utility of consumer functional response and the relative impact potential metric in impact forecasting.",https://doi.org/10.3897/neobiota.49.34986,10.3897/neobiota.49.34986,"Mofu, Lubabalo; Cuthbert, Ross N.; Dalu, Tatenda; Woodford, Darragh J.; Wasserman, Ryan J.; Dick, Jaimie T.

141,Prediction of Reservoir Storage Anomalies in India,"Reservoirs provide water for irrigation and hydropower and protect downstream regions from flooding. Reservoir storage is affected by drought, which hampers the ability to provide water for irrigation and hydropower. Despite the need for reservoir storage prediction for planning and decision-making, a reservoir storage forecast system at 1- to 3-month lead has been lacking for major reservoirs in India. Here we evaluate the potential of observed accumulated precipitation, standardized precipitation index (SPI), standardized precipitation evapotranspiration index (SPEI), standardized streamflow index (SSI), and observed reservoir storage to provide reservoir storage anomaly forecast at 1- to 3-month lead for the dry season (February to May) using a statistical approach. We find that accumulated precipitation for 3-11 months is strongly associated with the monthly reservoir storage anomalies in India. Moreover, accumulated precipitation and observed reservoir storage provide a reasonable (R-2 = 0.7) forecast skill for reservoir storage anomalies at 1- to 3-month lead. Similarly, SPI and SPEI can be used to predict reservoir storage anomalies at 1- to 3-month lead in India. Since the prediction skill from SPI and SPEI is similar, reservoir storage at monthly timescale is largely affected by accumulated precipitation instead of variability in air temperature. We find that the forecast skill for the 1-month lead from SPI, SPEI, and SSI is similar for Indira Sagar (Narmada) and Minimata (Mahanadi) reservoirs; however, prediction skill for reservoir storage anomalies improves substantially using SSI for 2- to 3-month lead. Reservoir storage anomalies forecast at 1- to 3-month lead can be valuable for water management-related decision-making and planning during the dry season in India.",https://doi.org/10.1029/2019JD030525,10.1029/2019JD030525,"Tiwari, Amar Deep; Mishra, Vimal",JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-ATMOSPHERES,,STREAMFLOW FORECASTS; SOIL-MOISTURE; TEMPERATURE EXTREMES; MODEL; DROUGHT; CLIMATE; INFLOW; VARIABILITY; MONSOON; PRECIPITATION,,AMER GEOPHYSICAL UNION,WASHINGTON,"2000 FLORIDA AVE NW, WASHINGTON, DC 20009 USA",2169-897X,2169-8996,,J GEOPHYS RES-ATMOS,J.

142,Optimization Assessment of Projection Methods of Climate Change for Discrepancies between North and South China,"Downscaling methods have been widely used due to the coarse and biased outputs of general circulation models (GCMs), which cannot be applied directly in regional climate change projection. Hence, appropriate selection of GCMs and downscaling methods is important for assessing the impacts of climate change. To explicitly explore the influences of multi-GCMs and different downscaling methods on climate change projection in various climate zones, the Heihe River Basin (HRB) and the Zhanghe River Basin (ZRB) were selected in this study to represent the north arid region and the south humid region in China, respectively. We first evaluated the performance of multi-GCMs derived from Coupled Model Inter-comparison Project Phase 5 (CMIP5) in the two regions based on in-situ measurements and the 40 year European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts (ECMWF) Re-Analysis (ERA-40) data. Subsequently, to construct appropriate climate change projection techniques, comparative analysis using two statistical downscaling methods was performed with consideration of the significant north-south meteorological discrepancies. Consequently, specific projections of future climate change for 2021-2050 under three representative concentration pathway (RCP) scenarios (RCP2.6, RCP4.5, and RCP8.5) were completed for the HRB and ZRB, including daily precipitation, maximum air temperature, and minimum air temperature. The results demonstrated that the score-based method with multiple criteria for performance evaluation of multiple GCMs more accurately captured the spatio-temporal characteristics of the regional climate. The two statistical downscaling methods showed respective advantages in arid and humid regions. The statistical downscaling model (SDSM) showed more accurate prediction capacities for air temperature in the arid-climate HRB, whereas model output statistics (MOS) better captured the probability distribution of precipitation in the ZRB, which is characterized by a humid climate. According to the results obtained in this study, the selection of appropriate GCMs and downscaling methods for specific climate zones with different meteorological features significantly impact regional climate change projection. The statistical downscaling models developed and recommended for the north and south of China in this study provide scientific reference for sustainable water resource management subject to climate change.",https://doi.org/10.3390/w12113106,10.3390/w12113106,"Lun, Yurui; Liu, Liu; Wang, Ruotong; Huang, Guanhua",WATER,climate change; downscaling; GCM; CMIP; ensemble; uncertainty,STATISTICAL DOWNSCALING METHODS; BIAS CORRECTION METHODS; REGIONAL CLIMATE; RIVER-BASIN; DAILY PRECIPITATION; TEMPORAL-CHANGES; RAINFALL; MODEL; UNCERTAINTY; IMPACTS,,MDPI,BASEL,"ST ALBAN-ANLAGE 66, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND",,2073-4441,,WATER-SUI,Water,NOV,2020,12,11,,,3106,
143,Satellite Gravimetry Improves Seasonal Streamflow Forecast Initialization in Africa,"West Africa is one of the poorest regions in the world and highly vulnerable to extreme hydrological events due to the lack of reliable monitoring and forecast systems. For the first time, we demonstrate that initial hydrological conditions informed by satellite-based terrestrial water storage (TWS) estimates improve seasonal streamflow forecasts. TWS variability detected by the Gravity Recovery and Climate Experiment (GRACE) satellites is assimilated into a land surface model during 2003-2016 and used to initialize 6-month hindcasts (i.e., forecasts of past events) during West Africa's wet seasons. We find that GRACE data assimilation (DA) generally increases groundwater and soil moisture storage in the region, resulting in increased evapotranspiration and reduced total runoff. Total runoff is particularly lower at the headwaters of the Niger River, positively impacting streamflow simulations and hindcast initializations. Compared to simulations without GRACE-DA, hindcasts are notably improved at locations draining from large basin areas, in particular, over the Niger River basin, which is consistent with GRACE's coarse spatial resolution. The long memory of groundwater and deep soil moisture, two main TWS components updated by GRACE-DA, is reflected in prolonged improvements in the streamflow hindcasts. Model accuracy at Niamey, Niger, the most populated city where streamflow observations are available, improved up to 33% during the flood season. These new findings directly contribute to ongoing developments in food security, flood potential forecast, and water-related disaster warning systems for Africa.",https://doi.org/10.1029/2019WR026259,10.1029/2019WR026259,"Getirana, Augusto; Jung, Hahn Chul; Arsenault, Kristi; Shukla, Shraddhanand; Kumar, Sujay; Peters-Lidard, Christa; Maigari, Issoufou; Mamane, Bako",WATER RESOURCES RESEARCH,seasonal forecast; GRACE; data assimilation; terrestrial water storage; streawmflow; West Africa,TERRESTRIAL WATER STORAGE; GRACE DATA ASSIMILATION; RADAR ALTIMETRY DATA; LAND-SURFACE MODEL; SOIL-MOISTURE; WEST-AFRICA; CLIMATE EXPERIMENT; GRAVITY RECOVERY; IN-SITU; BASIN,,AMER GEOPHYSICAL UNION,WASHINGTON,"2000 FLORIDA AVE NW, WASHINGTON, DC 20009 USA",0043-1397,1944-7973,,WATER RESOUR RES,Water Resour.

144,Interpretable machine learning to forecast hypoxia in a lagoon,"Dissolved oxygen is a key indicator in aquatic ecosystems, reflecting changes in water quality. Low levels of dissolved oxygen may lead to oxygen depletion (called hypoxia), putting at high risk the survival of aquatic organisms. Identifying the environmental conditions inducing hypoxia is therefore a topic of high ecological importance. In this study, we used four machine learning algorithms (Extreme Gradient Boosting (XGBoost), Extremely Randomized Trees (EXT), Random Forest, and Logistic Regression) to forecast hypoxia in a lagoon, considering different time lags (2,5,10 and 20-days). To do so, we used data on dissolved oxygen and a total of nine physicochemical and meteorological variables from Papas lagoon, Greece during 2015-2018. Key drivers and synergies that increase the risk of hypoxia were identified using the Shapley Additive explanations (SHAP) methodology. EXT was slightly superior to the other algorithms in forecasting hypoxia, achieving a success between 89% and 94% with pH, water temperature, chlorophyll and salinity as top explanatory variables. SHAP showed that the synergistic effect of low pH and chlorophyll, and elevated water temperature and salinity tended to favor conditions leading to hypoxia. SHAP also illustrated that diverse synergies of the explanatory variables can induce hypoxia, indicating the complex and nonlinear relationships between environmental factors and hypoxia. Overall, the present approach may be proved useful for the development of a reliable forecasting tool for alarming hypoxia and, ultimately, the effective monitoring of the lagoon.",https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ecoinf.2021.101480,10.1016/j.ecoinf.2021.101480,"Politikos, Dimitris, V; Petasis, Georgios; Katselis, George",ECOLOGICAL INFORMATICS,Dissolved oxygen; Machine learning; classification; Hypoxia; SHAP; Interpretability,DISSOLVED-OXYGEN; WATER-QUALITY; NEURAL-NETWORK; PAPAS LAGOON; SUMMER; MODEL; REGRESSION; TESTS,,ELSEVIER,AMSTERDAM,"RADARWEG 29, 1043 NX AMSTERDAM, NETHERLANDS",1574-9541,1878-0512,,ECOL INFORM,Ecol.

145,Forecast of winter low flows in a cold-region river under the impact of climate warming,"Changes in winter low flow (WLF) in cold-region rivers affect engineering design, water quality, and river ecosystem health. This paper aims to quantify to what extent WLF will change under climate warming and to propose a practical forecasting model for WLF predictions. The new concept of cumulative watershed temperature (CWT) is used as a convenient lumped surrogate for complicated hydrological processes that influence WLF. Statistical analyses of century-long flow data from the Fraser River in British Columbia, Canada show a strong dependence of WLF on CWT. In winter season, time series of CWT and WLF are shown to each divide into a falling and a rising limb at the data point of their lowest values, being -358 degrees C and 827 m3/s (historical averages), respectively. The falling and rising limbs describe the cumulative freezing and thawing effects of air temperatures fluctuating around the freezing point on WLF changes. The correlation between CWT and WLF (time series) data points on the rising limbs forms the forecasting model, expressing WLF as a function of CWT in terms of their z-scores. The model takes input of Global Circulation Model (GCM) projections of temperature increases by the end of 21st century under different Representative Concentration Pathways (RCPs), and predicts changes of Fraser River WLF from the historical average. RCP4.5 causes a 22.6% increase (ensemble average from six GCMs). RCP8.5 increases WLF by 20% (for some future years) to 44% (for others). The methods reported in this paper can be adapted to other cold regions.",https://doi.org/10.1016/j.coldregions.2021.103448,10.1016/j.coldregions.2021.103448,"Kochukrishnan, Aneesh; Li, S.

146,Dynamic monitoring and prediction of Dianchi Lake cyanobacteria outbreaks in the context of rapid urbanization,"Water crises have been among the most serious environmental problems worldwide since the twenty-first century. A water crisis is marked by a severe shortage of water resources and deteriorating water quality. As an important component of water resources, lake water quality has deteriorated rapidly in the context of fast urbanization and climate change. This deterioration has altered the water ecosystem structure and influenced lake functionality. To curb these trends, various strategies and procedures have been used in many urban lakes. Among these procedures, accurate and responsive water environment monitoring is the basis of the forecasting and prevention of large-scale cyanobacteria outbreaks and improvement of water quality. To dynamically monitor and predict the outbreak of cyanobacteria in Dianchi Lake, in this study, wireless sensors networks (WSNs) and the geographic information system(GIS) are used tomonitor water quality at the macro-scale and meso-scale. Historical, real-time water quality and weather condition data were collected, and a combination prediction model (adaptive grey model (AGM) and back propagation artificial neural network (BPANN)) was proposed. The correlation coefficient (R) of the simulation experiment reached 0.995. Moreover, we conducted an empirical experiment in Dianchi Lake, Yunnan, China using the proposed method. R was 0.93, and the predicting error was 4.77. The results of the experiment suggest that our model has good performance for water quality prediction and can forecast cyanobacteria outbreaks. This system provides responsive forewarning and data support for lake protection and pollution control.",https://doi.org/10.1007/s11356-016-8155-2,10.1007/s11356-016-8155-2,"Luo, Yi; Yang, Kun; Yu, Zhenyu; Chen, Junyi; Xu, Yufei; Zhou, Xiaolu; Yang, Yang",ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE AND POLLUTION RESEARCH,Urbanization; Cyanobacteria; Wireless sensor networks; GIS; Grey model; Artificial neural network,SENSOR,,SPRINGER HEIDELBERG,HEIDELBERG,"TIERGARTENSTRASSE 17, D-69121 HEIDELBERG, GERMANY",0944-1344,1614-7499,,ENVIRON SCI POLLUT R,Environ.

147,Climate Forecasts and Flood Mitigation,"There is growing evidence that flood mitigation is often inefficient because individuals misestimate flood risk. The propensity to misestimate flood risk is expected to rise because climate change ensures the past will be a poor predictor of the future. Greater reliance on downscaled climatological and hydrological forecasts has been suggested to address these information failures. This article combines stochastic dynamic programming with historical data and climate-driven streamflow projections to determine how changes in flood risk forecasts influence optimal investments in flood mitigation infrastructure. Using upgrades in California's levee system as an example, we show that climate change is causing benefit-cost analysis to become increasingly biased in favor of flood mitigation infrastructure projects. We also show that using downscaled hydroclimate forecasts to achieve more accurate estimates of flood risk can decrease the efficiency of flood mitigation infrastructure investments, if flood risk is currently overestimated.

148,A multi-stage methodology for selecting input variables in ANN forecasting of river flows,"The scientific community has recognized the necessity for more efficiently selected inputs in artificial neural network models (ANNs) in river flows and has worked on this despite some shortcomings. Moreover, there is none or limited inclusion of ANN inputs coupled with atmospheric circulation under various patterns arising from the need of data downscaling for climate change predictions in hydrology domain. This paper presents the results of a novel multi-stage methodology for selecting input variables used in artificial neural network (ANN) models for river flow forecasting. The proposed methodology makes use of data correlations together with a set of crucial statistical indices for optimizing model performance, both in terms of ANN structure (e. g. neurons, momentum rate, learning rate, activation functions, etc), but also in terms of inputs selection. The latter include various previous time steps of daily areal precipitation and temperature data coupled with atmospheric circulation in the form of circulation patterns, observed river flow data and time expressed via functions of sine and cosine. Additionally, the non-linear behavior between river flow and the respective inputs is investigated by the ANN configuration itself and not only by correlation indices (or other equivalent contingency tools). The proposed methodology revealed the river flow of past four days, the precipitation of past three days and the seasonality as robust input variables. However, the temperature of three past days should be considered as an alternative against the seasonality. The produced models forecasting ability was validated by comparing its one-step ahead flow prediction ability to two other approaches (an auto regressive model and a genetic algorithm (GA)-optimized single input ANN).",https://doi.org/,,"Panagoulia, D.; Tsekouras, G.

149,Projected increases and shifts in rain-on-snow flood risk over western North America,"Destructive and costly flooding can occur when warm storm systems deposit substantial rain on extensive snowcover(1-6), as observed in February 2017 with the Oroville Dam crisis in California(7). However, decision-makers lack guidance on how such rain-on-snow (ROS) flood risk may respond to climate change. Here, daily ROS events with flood-generating potential(8) are simulated over western North America for a historical (2000-2013) and future (forced under Representative Concentration Pathway 8.5(9)) period with the Weather Research and Forecasting model; 4 km resolution allows the basin-scale ROS flood risk to be assessed. In the warmer climate, we show that ROS becomes less frequent at lower elevations due to snowpack declines, particularly in warmer areas (for example, the Pacific maritime region). By contrast, at higher elevations where seasonal snowcover persists, ROS becomes more frequent due to a shift from snowfall to rain. Accordingly, the water available for runoff(10) increases for 55% of western North American river basins, with corresponding increases in flood risk of 20-200%, the greatest changes of which are projected for the Sierra Nevada, the Colorado River headwaters and the Canadian Rocky Mountains. Thus, flood control and water resource planning must consider ROS to fully quantify changes in flood risk with anthropogenic warming.",https://doi.org/10.1038/s41558-018-0236-4,10.1038/s41558-018-0236-4,"Musselman, Keith N.; Lehner, Flavio; Ikeda, Kyoko; Clark, Martyn P.; Prein, Andreas F.; Liu, Changhai; Barlage, Mike; Rasmussen, Roy",NATURE CLIMATE CHANGE,,CLIMATE; EVENTS; WATER; PRECIPITATION; RUNOFF; SIMULATION; IMPACTS; BALANCE; ENERGY,,NATURE PORTFOLIO,BERLIN,"HEIDELBERGER PLATZ 3, BERLIN, 14197, GERMANY",1758-678X,1758-6798,,NAT CLIM CHANGE,Nat.

151,Water Quality Prediction Model Based Support Vector Machine Model for Ungauged River Catchment under Dual Scenarios,"Water quality analysis is a crucial step in water resources management and needs to be addressed urgently to control any pollution that may adversely affect the ecosystem and to ensure the environmental standards are being met. Thus, this work is an attempt to develop an efficient model using support vector machine (SVM) to predict the water quality of Langat River Basin through the analysis of the data of six parameters of dual reservoirs that are located in the catchment. The proposed model could be considered as an effective tool for identifying the water quality status for the river catchment area. In addition, the major advantage of the proposed model is that it could be useful for ungauged catchments or those lacking enough numbers of monitoring stations for water quality parameters. These parameters, namely pH, Suspended Solids (SS), Dissolved Oxygen (DO), Ammonia Nitrogen (AN), Chemical Oxygen Demand (COD), and Biochemical Oxygen Demand (BOD) were provided by the Malaysian Department of Environment (DOE). The differences between dual scenarios 1 and 2 depend on the information from prior stations to forecast DO levels for succeeding sites (Scenario 2). This scheme has the capacity to simulate water-quality accurately, with small prediction errors. The resulting correlation coefficient has maximum values of 0.998 and 0.979 after the application of Scenario 1. The approach with Type 1 SVM regression along with 10-fold cross-validation methods worked to generate precise results.

152,Exploring the Application of Artificial Neural Network in Rural Streamflow Prediction - A Feasibility Study,"Streams and rivers play a critical role in the hydrologic cycle with their management being essential to maintaining a balance across social, economic and environmental outcomes. Accurate streamflow predictions can provide benefits in many different ways such as water allocation decision making, flood forecasting and environmental watering regimes. This is particularly important in regional areas of Australia where rivers can play a critical role in irrigated agriculture, recreation and social wellbeing, major floods and sustainable environments. There are several hydrological parameters that effect stream flows in rivers and a major challenge with any prediction methodology, is to understand these parameter interdependencies, correlations and their individual effects. A robust methodology is, thus, required for accurate prediction of streamflow under usually unique, waterway-specific conditions using available data. This research employs an approach based on Artificial Neural Network (ANN) to provide this robust methodology. Data from readily available sources has been selected to provide appropriate input and output parameters to train, validate and optimise the neural network. The optimisation steps of the methodology are discussed and the predicted outputs are compared and analysed with respect to the actual collected values.",https://doi.org/,,"Choudhury, T.

153,Variational Bayesian Neural Network for Ensemble Flood Forecasting,"Disastrous floods are destructive and likely to cause widespread economic losses. An understanding of flood forecasting and its potential forecast uncertainty is essential for water resource managers. Reliable forecasting may provide future streamflow information to assist in an assessment of the benefits of reservoirs and the risk of flood disasters. However, deterministic forecasting models are not able to provide forecast uncertainty information. To quantify the forecast uncertainty, a variational Bayesian neural network (VBNN) model for ensemble flood forecasting is proposed in this study. In VBNN, the posterior distribution is approximated by the variational distribution, which can avoid the heavy computational costs in the traditional Bayesian neural network. To transform the model parameters' uncertainty into the model output uncertainty, a Monte Carlo sample is applied to give ensemble forecast results. The proposed method is verified by a flood forecasting case study on the upper Yangtze River. A point forecasting model neural network and two probabilistic forecasting models, including hidden Markov Model and Gaussian process regression, are also applied to compare with the proposed model. The experimental results show that the VBNN performs better than other comparable models in terms of both accuracy and reliability. Finally, the result of uncertainty estimation shows that the VBNN can effectively handle heteroscedastic flood streamflow data.",https://doi.org/10.3390/w12102740,10.3390/w12102740,"Zhan, Xiaoyan; Qin, Hui; Liu, Yongqi; Yao, Liqiang; Xie, Wei; Liu, Guanjun; Zhou, Jianzhong",WATER,Bayesian neural networks; flood forecast; variational inference; forecast uncertainty,OPTIMIZATION; INTERVAL; RUNOFF; MODELS,,MDPI,BASEL,"ST ALBAN-ANLAGE 66, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND",,2073-4441,,WATER-SUI,Water,OCT,2020,12,10,,,2740,
154,"Newly explored machine learning model for river flow time series forecasting at Mary River, Australia","Hourly river flow pattern monitoring and simulation is the indispensable precautionary task for river engineering sustainability, water resource management, flood risk mitigation, and impact reduction. Reliable river flow forecasting is highly emphasized to support major decision-makers. This research paper adopts a new implementation approach for the application of a river flow prediction model for hourly prediction of the flow of Mary River in Australia; a novel data-intelligent model called emotional neural network (ENN) was used for this purpose. A historical dataset measured over a 4-year period (2011-2014) at hourly timescale was used in building the ENN-based predictive model. The results of the ENN model were validated against the existing approaches such as the minimax probability machine regression (MPMR), relevance vector machine (RVM), and multivariate adaptive regression splines (MARS) models. The developed models are evaluated against each other for validation purposes. Various numerical and graphical performance evaluators are conducted to assess the predictability of the proposed ENN and the competitive benchmark models. The ENN model, used as an objective simulation tool, revealed an outstanding performance when applied for hourly river flow prediction in comparison with the other benchmark models. However, the order of the model, performance wise, is ENN > MARS > RVM > MPMR. In general, the present results of the proposed ENN model reveal a promising modeling strategy for the hourly simulation of river flow, and such a model can be explored further for its ability to contribute to the state-of-the-art of river engineering and water resources monitoring and future prediction at near real-time forecast horizons.",https://doi.org/10.1007/s10661-020-08724-1,10.1007/s10661-020-08724-1,"Cui, Fang; Salih, Sinan Q.; Choubin, Bahram; Bhagat, Suraj Kumar; Samui, Pijush; Yaseen, Zaher Mundher",ENVIRONMENTAL MONITORING AND ASSESSMENT,River flow monitoring; Water resources management; Emotional neural network; Machine learning,ADAPTIVE REGRESSION SPLINES; SUPPORT VECTOR REGRESSION; NEURAL-NETWORK; STREAMFLOW; RUNOFF; PERFORMANCE; PREDICTION; SIMULATION; ALGORITHM; ACCURACY,,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0167-6369,1573-2959,,ENVIRON MONIT ASSESS,Environ.

155,Real-time forecasting of river water level in urban based on radar rainfall: A case study in Fuzhou City,"Urban river network plays an important role in the process of drainage. The real-time prediction system of river water level can provide early warning information to the decision-makers of relevant departments in time, which plays an important role in reducing flood risk. Aiming at the rapid and strong response of urban river to rainfall, a real-time rolling prediction system of urban river water level is proposed based on radar rainfall prediction products and coupling model of hydrology and hydrodynamics. In the system, each simulation is divided into two parts: the review period and the prediction period. In the review period, the river model is driven by the observed rainfall to obtain the latest simulation state to avoid cumulative error, while in the prediction period, the radar rainfall is used to drive in the short-term prediction of river water level. Taking Fuzhou as the research area, a long series review of the process from April 1, 2020 to October 1, 2020 was carried out. The accuracy of the river model, radar-rainfall and prediction system during the study period are evaluated and discussed in detail. The results show that the river model can simulate the process of water level change in rainfall and rain free period. The performance of radar rainfall to total rainfall prediction is better than that of process prediction. The real-time prediction system can give the water level risk according to each radar forecast rainfall process, and has good performance in judging the peak water level and peak time, which can provide reference for urban river dispatching decision-makers.",https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jhydrol.2021.126820,10.1016/j.jhydrol.2021.126820,"Liu, Yu; Wang, Hao; Lei, Xiaohui",JOURNAL OF HYDROLOGY,Real-time rolling forecast; Urban river; Radar rainfall; Coupling model of hydrology and hydrodynamics,FLOOD-CONTROL; MODEL,,ELSEVIER,AMSTERDAM,"RADARWEG 29, 1043 NX AMSTERDAM, NETHERLANDS",0022-1694,1879-2707,,J HYDROL,J.

156,Technical note: Combining quantile forecasts and predictive distributions of streamflows,"The enhanced availability of many different hydro-meteorological modelling and forecasting systems raises the issue of how to optimally combine this great deal of information. Especially the usage of deterministic and probabilistic forecasts with sometimes widely divergent predicted future streamflow values makes it even more complicated for decision makers to sift out the relevant information. In this study multiple streamflow forecast information will be aggregated based on several different predictive distributions, and quantile forecasts. For this combination the Bayesian model averaging (BMA) approach, the nonhomogeneous Gaussian regression (NGR), also known as the ensemble model output statistic (EMOS) techniques, and a novel method called Beta-transformed linear pooling (BLP) will be applied. By the help of the quantile score (QS) and the continuous ranked probability score (CRPS), the combination results for the Sihl River in Switzerland with about 5 years of forecast data will be compared and the differences between the raw and optimally combined forecasts will be highlighted. The results demonstrate the importance of applying proper forecast combination methods for decision makers in the field of flood and water resource management.",https://doi.org/10.5194/hess-21-5493-2017,10.5194/hess-21-5493-2017,"Bogner, Konrad; Liechti, Katharina; Zappa, Massimiliano",HYDROLOGY AND EARTH SYSTEM SCIENCES,,PROBABILISTIC FORECASTS; REGRESSION; UNCERTAINTY; SYSTEM; CALIBRATION; ACCURACY; MODELS,,COPERNICUS GESELLSCHAFT MBH,GOTTINGEN,"BAHNHOFSALLEE 1E, GOTTINGEN, 37081, GERMANY",1027-5606,1607-7938,,HYDROL EARTH SYST SC,Hydrol.

157,The Applicability of LSTM-KNN Model for Real-Time Flood Forecasting in Different Climate Zones in China,"Flow forecasting is an essential topic for flood prevention and mitigation. This study utilizes a data-driven approach, the Long Short-Term Memory neural network (LSTM), to simulate rainfall runoff relationships for catchments with different climate conditions. The LSTM method presented was tested in three catchments with distinct climate zones in China. The recurrent neural network (RNN) was adopted for comparison to verify the superiority of the LSTM model in terms of time series prediction problems. The results of LSTM were also compared with a widely used process-based model, the Xinanjiang model (XAJ), as a benchmark to test the applicability of this novel method. The results suggest that LSTM could provide comparable quality predictions as the XAJ model and can be considered an efficient hydrology modeling approach. A real-time forecasting approach coupled with the k-nearest neighbor (KNN) algorithm as an updating method was proposed in this study to generalize the plausibility of the LSTM method for flood forecasting in a decision support system. We compared the simulation results of the LSTM and the LSTM-KNN model, which demonstrated the effectiveness of the LSTM-KNN model in the study areas and underscored the potential of the proposed model for real-time flood forecasting.",https://doi.org/10.3390/w12020440,10.3390/w12020440,"Liu, Moyang; Huang, Yingchun; Li, Zhijia; Tong, Bingxing; Liu, Zhentao; Sun, Mingkun; Jiang, Feiqing; Zhang, Hanchen",WATER,data-driven model; LSTM; Xinanjiang model; KNN; real-time hydrological forecasting,XINANJIANG MODEL; NEURAL-NETWORK; RIVER; PREDICTION; FUTURE,,MDPI,BASEL,"ST ALBAN-ANLAGE 66, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND",,2073-4441,,WATER-SUI,Water,FEB,2020,12,2,,,440,

The understanding on how reservoir inflows are affected by different climatic and hydrological conditions is crucial to enable effective water management and downstream flood control. In this research, we propose a method using a Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) Artificial Neural Network (ANN) to assist the aforesaid decision-making process. The Kotmale reservoir which is the uppermost reservoir in the Mahaweli reservoir complex in Sri Lanka was used as the test bed for this research. The ANN uses the runoff in the Kotmale reservoir catchment area and the effect of Sea Surface temperatures (SST) to make a forecast for seven days ahead.

159,Real-Time Flood Control by Tree-Based Model Predictive Control Including Forecast Uncertainty: A Case Study Reservoir in Turkey,"Optimal control of reservoirs is a challenging task due to conflicting objectives, complex system structure, and uncertainties in the system. Real time control decisions suffer from streamflow forecast uncertainty. This study aims to use Probabilistic Streamflow Forecasts (PSFs) having a lead-time up to 48 h as input for the recurrent reservoir operation problem. A related technique for decision making is multi-stage stochastic optimization using scenario trees, referred to as Tree-based Model Predictive Control (TB-MPC). Deterministic Streamflow Forecasts (DSFs) are provided by applying random perturbations on perfect data. PSFs are synthetically generated from DSFs by a new approach which explicitly presents dynamic uncertainty evolution. We assessed different variables in the generation of stochasticity and compared the results using different scenarios. The developed real-time hourly flood control was applied to a test case which had limited reservoir storage and restricted downstream condition. According to hindcasting closed-loop experiment results, TB-MPC outperforms the deterministic counterpart in terms of decreased downstream flood risk according to different independent forecast scenarios. TB-MPC was also tested considering different number of tree branches, forecast horizons, and different inflow conditions. We conclude that using synthetic PSFs in TB-MPC can provide more robust solutions against forecast uncertainty by resolution of uncertainty in trees.",https://doi.org/10.3390/w10030340,10.3390/w10030340,"Uysal, Goekcen; Alvarado-Montero, Rodolfo; Schwanenberg, Dirk; Sensoy, Aynur",WATER,reservoir operation; multi-stage stochastic optimization; TB-MPC; flood control; real-time control,SYNTHETIC STREAMFLOW GENERATION; TERM OPTIMAL OPERATION; MULTIRESERVOIR SYSTEMS; OPTIMIZATION; MANAGEMENT; ERRORS; ALGORITHMS; TAIWAN; FUTURE; RULES,,MDPI,BASEL,"ST ALBAN-ANLAGE 66, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND",,2073-4441,,WATER-SUI,Water,MAR,2018,10,3,,,340,
160,Streamflow Forecasting Using Empirical Wavelet Transform and Artificial Neural Networks,"Accurate and reliable streamflow forecasting plays an important role in various aspects of water resources management such as reservoir scheduling and water supply. This paper shows the development of a novel hybrid model for streamflow forecasting and demonstrates its efficiency. In the proposed hybrid model for streamflow forecasting, the empirical wavelet transform (EWT) is firstly employed to eliminate the redundant noises from the original streamflow series. Secondly, the partial autocorrelation function (PACF) values are explored to identify the inputs for the artificial neural network (ANN) models. Thirdly, the weights and biases of the ANN architecture are tuned and optimized by the multi-verse optimizer (MVO) algorithm. Finally, the simulated streamflow is obtained using the well-trained MVO-ANN model. The proposed hybrid model has been applied to annual streamflow observations from four hydrological stations in the upper reaches of the Yangtze River, China. Parallel experiments using non-denoising models, the back propagation neural network (BPNN) and the ANN optimized by the particle swarm optimization algorithm (PSO-ANN) have been designed and conducted to compare with the proposed model. Results obtained from this study indicate that the proposed hybrid model can capture the nonlinear characteristics of the streamflow time series and thus provides more accurate forecasting results.",https://doi.org/10.3390/w9060406,10.3390/w9060406,"Peng, Tian; Zhou, Jianzhong; Zhang, Chu; Fu, Wenlong",WATER,empirical wavelet transform; multi-verse optimizer; artificial neural networks; annual streamflow forecasting; data-driven modeling,SUPPORT VECTOR MACHINE; SHORT-TERM; FEATURE-SELECTION; HYBRID MODEL; DECOMPOSITION; PREDICTION; SERIES; ELM; CLASSIFICATION; OPTIMIZATION,,MDPI,BASEL,"ST ALBAN-ANLAGE 66, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND",,2073-4441,,WATER-SUI,Water,JUN,2017,9,6,,,406,
161,Balancing Flood Rick and Water Supply in California: Policy Search Integrating Short-Term Forecast Ensembles With Conjunctive Use,"Short-term weather forecasts have the potential to improve reservoir operations for both flood control and water supply objectives, especially in regions currently relying on fixed seasonal flood pools to mitigate risk. The successful development of forecast-based policies should integrate uncertainty from modern forecast products to create unambiguous rules that can be tested on out-of-sample periods. This study investigates the potential for such operating policies to improve water supply efficiency while maintaining flood protection, combining state-of-the-art weather hindcasts with downstream conjunctive use to transfer surplus flood releases to groundwater storage. Because available weather hindcasts are relatively short (10-20 years), we propose a novel statistical framework to develop synthetic forecasts over longer periods of the historical record. Operating rules are trained with a recently developed policy search framework in which decision rules are structured as binary trees. Policies are developed for a range of scenarios with varying forecast skill and conjunctive use capacity, using Folsom Reservoir, California, as a case study. Results suggest that the combination of conjunctive use and short-term weather forecasts can substantially improve both water supply and flood control objectives by allowing storage to remain high until forecasts trigger a release. Further, increased conjunctive use capacity reduces the importance of forecast skill, since surface storage can be moved to groundwater during the flood season without losing water supply. This analysis serves the development of forecast-based operating policies for large, multipurpose reservoirs in California and other regions with similar flood hydroclimatology.",https://doi.org/10.1029/2018WR023177,10.1029/2018WR023177,"Nayak, Munir Ahmad; Herman, Jonathan D.; Steinschneider, Scott",WATER RESOURCES RESEARCH,,ATMOSPHERIC RIVERS; PRECIPITATION FORECASTS; OPTIMAL OPERATION; OPTIMIZATION; MULTIMODEL; PREDICTION; WEATHER; SYSTEMS; MANAGEMENT; RESERVOIRS,,AMER GEOPHYSICAL UNION,WASHINGTON,"2000 FLORIDA AVE NW, WASHINGTON, DC 20009 USA",0043-1397,1944-7973,,WATER RESOUR RES,Water Resour.

162,Forecasting a 2-methylisoborneol outbreak in a brackish lake,"2-Methylisoborneol (2-MIB) is the primary cause of the earthy and musty odor produced by cyanobacteria, which deteriorates the quality of fishery products and tap water. Despite the need for controlling outbreaks, few studies have been conducted on 2-MIB in brackish lakes, where capture fisheries are active. This study examined the association between water quality and the outbreak of 2-MIB in a brackish lake using statistical analysis of long-term monitoring data and developed forecasting models for 2-MIB outbreaks. We investigated Lake Ogawara, which is a brackish lake with a cool-temperate climate in Japan, where 2-MIB outbreaks frequently occur between August and December. Logistic regression analyses were performed using the outbreak or non-outbreak of 2-MIB (2-MIB(+ / -)) as the dependent variable and water quality parameters as the independent variables. The results suggested that the density of 2-MIB-producing cyanobacteria was higher when (1) dissolved inorganic nitrogen concentrations were low under the relaxation of phosphorus limitation and/or (2) salinity or micronutrient concentrations were high. In addition, we successfully developed forecasting models with a high predictive power that determined 2-MIB(+ / -) in August-December using only two water quality parameters: dissolved inorganic phosphate and pH in April and total nitrogen/total phosphorous and salinity in May.",https://doi.org/10.1007/s10661-021-09140-9,10.1007/s10661-021-09140-9,"Shizuka, Kazunori; Maie, Nagamitsu; Kakino, Wataru; Taruya, Hiroyuki; Tanji, Hajime",ENVIRONMENTAL MONITORING AND ASSESSMENT,2-Methylisoborneol; Brackish lake; Cyanobacteria; Fishery damage; Forecasting model; Water quality,DRINKING-WATER; ODOR COMPOUNDS; OFF-FLAVORS; TASTE; GEOSMIN; QUALITY; BLOOM,,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0167-6369,1573-2959,,ENVIRON MONIT ASSESS,Environ.

This study shows that nonlinear autoregressive with exogenous inputs neural networks can provide accurate models to predict nitrate plus nitrite concentrations in waterways. The Susquehanna River and the Raccoon River, USA, were chosen as case studies. Water discharge, water temperature, dissolved oxygen, and specific conductance were considered exogenous inputs. The forecasting sensitivity to changes in the exogenous input parameters and time series length was also assessed. For Kreutz Creek at Strickler station (Pennsylvania), the prediction accuracy increased with the number of exogenous input variables, with the best performance achieved considering all the variables (R-2 = 0.77). The predictions were accurate also for the Raccoon River (Iowa), although only the water discharge was considered exogenous input (South Raccoon River at Redfield-R-2 = 0.94).

165,Forecasting the future establishment of invasive alien freshwater fish species,"Invasive alien species constitute a major threat to the world's freshwater ecosystems. Human translocations as well as rising temperatures have allowed freshwater fish species to expand their distribution into novel ecosystems, often with negative effects on native biodiversity. Early intervention is key to restricting damage and further spread of invasive aliens. This makes identification of areas with high risk for the establishment of invasive alien species necessary in order to target monitoring and mitigation measures. Here, we model lake-specific likelihood of establishment of five freshwater fish species which are increasing their distribution in Norway. In order to establish the likelihood of establishment resulting from human translocation, environmental factors or natural dispersal from an established population, a suite of anthropogenic and environmental covariates were included as predictors. We used these models to create a future scenario which modelled establishment risk for these species over a 50-year time period. Connectivity of lakes to other extant populations and anthropogenic covariates influenced likelihood of establishment-and subsequently future establishment risk-the most across all species. The effects of temperature were variable, and for the most part had little effect on likelihood of establishment. Our results indicate that human behaviour, infrastructure development and alternations of watershed connectivity are more important than climate induced range shifts on a short to medium time horizon. Synthesis and applications. Our study demonstrates how risk assessments of invasive establishment can be synthesised based on readily available open data sources. This allows for the construction of tools to forecast invasion hotspots as a basis for designing mitigation actions, including early monitoring programs, horizon scanning initiatives and eradication measures. It also allows managers to determine where species are spreading as a result of direct human translocation, and where they are expanding as a result of increased temperatures.",https://doi.org/10.1111/1365-2664.13993,10.1111/1365-2664.13993,"Perrin, Sam Wenaas; Baerum, Kim Magnus; Helland, Ingeborg Palm; Finstad, Anders Gravbrot",JOURNAL OF APPLIED ECOLOGY,connectivity; forecasting; freshwater fish; invasive alien species,COMMUNITY STRUCTURE; CLIMATE-CHANGE; POPULATIONS; PREDICTION; TRANSPORT; PATHWAYS; SPREAD; SHAPE; RISK,,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0021-8901,1365-2664,,J APPL ECOL,J.

The water resources management actions for this massive system are critically linked to North America's economy, and to human health and safety, through planning and policy decisions related to hydropower management, commercial navigation, and water level fluctuations.

167,"Evaluating and Predicting the Effects of Land Use Changes on Hydrology in Wami River Basin, Tanzania","Understanding the variation in the hydrological response of a basin associated with land use changes is essential for developing management strategies for water resources. The impact of hydrological changes caused by expected land use changes may be severe for the Wami river system, given its role as a crucial area for water, providing food and livelihoods. The objective of this study is to examine the influence of land use changes on various elements of the hydrological processes of the basin. Hybrid classification, which includes unsupervised and supervised classification techniques, is used to process the images (2000 and 2016), while CA-Markov chain analysis is used to forecast and simulate the 2032 land use state. In the current study, a combined approach-including a Soil and Water Assessment Tool (SWAT) model and Partial Least Squares Regression (PLSR)-is used to explore the influences of individual land use classes on fluctuations in the hydrological components. From the study, it is evident that land use has changed across the basin since 2000 (which is expected to continue in 2032), as well as that the hydrological effects caused by land use changes were observed. It has been found that the major land use changes that affected hydrology components in the basin were expansion of cultivation land, built-up area and grassland, and decline in natural forests and woodland during the study period.

168,Performance Comparison of an LSTM-based Deep Learning Model versus Conventional Machine Learning Algorithms for Streamflow Forecasting,"Streamflow forecasting plays a key role in improvement of water resource allocation, management and planning, flood warning and forecasting, and mitigation of flood damages. There are a considerable number of forecasting models and techniques that have been employed in streamflow forecasting and gained importance in hydrological studies in recent decades. In this study, the main objective was to compare the accuracy of four data-driven techniques of Linear Regression (LR), Multilayer Perceptron (MLP), Support Vector Machine (SVM), and Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) network in daily streamflow forecasting. For this purpose, three scenarios were defined based on historical precipitation and streamflow series for 26 years of the Kentucky River basin located in eastern Kentucky, US. Statistical criteria including the coefficient of correlation (R), Nash-Sutcliff coefficient of efficiency (E), Nash-Sutcliff for High flow (E-H), Nash-Sutcliff for Low flow (E-L), normalized root mean square error (NRMSE), relative error in estimating maximum flow (REmax), threshold statistics (TS), and average absolute relative error (AARE) were employed to compare the performances of these methods. The results show that the LSTM network outperforms the other models in forecasting daily streamflow with the lowest values of NRMSE and the highest values of E-H, E-L, and R under all scenarios. These findings indicated that the LSTM is a robust data-driven technique to characterize the time series behaviors in hydrological modeling applications.",https://doi.org/10.1007/s11269-021-02937-w,10.1007/s11269-021-02937-w,"Rahimzad, Maryam; Moghaddam Nia, Alireza; Zolfonoon, Hosam; Soltani, Jaber; Danandeh Mehr, Ali; Kwon, Hyun-Han",WATER RESOURCES MANAGEMENT,Streamflow forecasting; Data-driven modeling; LSTM; Deep learning; Machine learning algorithms,SHORT-TERM-MEMORY; DRIVEN; TOPOGRAPHY; PARADIGM; SVM,,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0920-4741,1573-1650,,WATER RESOUR MANAG,Water Resour.

169,Prediction of nitrate accumulation and leaching beneath groundwater irrigated corn fields in the Upper Platte basin under a future climate scenario,"Understanding the impacts of future climate change on soil hydrological processes and solute transport is crucial to develop appropriate strategies to minimize the adverse impacts of agricultural activities on groundwater quality. To evaluate the direct effects of climate change on the transport and accumulation of nitrale-N, we developed an integrated modeling framework combining climatic change, nitrate-N infiltration in the unsaturated zone, and groundwater level fluctuations. The study was based on a center-pivot irrigated corn field at the Nebraska Management Systems Evaluation Area (MSEA) site. Future groundwater recharge (GR) and actual evapotranspiration (ETa) rates were predicted via an inverse vadose zone modeling approach by using climatic data generated by the Weather Research and Forecasting (WRF) climate model under the RCP 8.5 scenario, which was downscaled from the global CCSM4 model to a resolution of 24 km by 24 km. A groundwater flow model was first calibrated on the basis of historical groundwater table measurements and then applied to predict the future groundwater table in 2057-2060. Finally, the predicted future GR rate, ETa rate, and groundwater level, together with future precipitation data from the WRF climate model, were used in a three-dimensional (3D) model to predict nitrate-N concentrations in tire subsurface (saturated and unsaturated parts) from 2057 to 2060. The future GR was predicted to decrease in the study area, as compared with the average GR data from the literature. Correspondingly, the groundwater level was predicted to decrease (30 to 60 cm) over the 5 years of simulation in the future.

170,Multi-step rainfall forecasting using deep learning approach,"Rainfall prediction is immensely crucial in daily life routine as well as for water resource management, stochastic hydrology, rain run-off modeling and flood risk mitigation. Quantitative prediction of rainfall time series is extremely challenging as compared to other meteorological parameters due to its variability in local features that involves temporal and spatial scales. Consequently, this requires a highly complex system having an advance model to accurately capture the highly non linear processes occurring in the climate. The focus of this work is direct prediction of multistep forecasting, where a separate time series model for each forecasting horizon is considered and forecasts are computed using observed data samples. Forecasting in this method is performed by proposing a deep learning approach, i.e, Temporal Deep Belief Network (DBN). The best model is selected from several baseline models on the basis of performance analysis metrics. The results suggest that the temporal DBN model outperforms the conventional Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) specifically on rainfall time series forecasting. According to our experimentation, a modified DBN with hidden layes (300-200-100-10) performs best with 4.59E-05, 0.0068 and 0.94 values of MSE, RMSE and R value respectively on testing samples. However, we found that training DBN is more exhaustive and computationally intensive than other deep learning architectures. Findings of this research can be further utilized as basis for the advance forecasting of other weather parameters with same climate conditions.",https://doi.org/10.7717/peerj-cs.514,10.7717/peerj-cs.514,"Narejo, Sanam; Jawaid, Muhammad Moazzam; Talpur, Shahnawaz; Baloch, Rizwan; Pasero, Eros Gian Alessandro",PEERJ COMPUTER SCIENCE,Rainfall prediction; Deep learning; Convolutional neural networks (CNNs); Temporal data; Multi-step forecasting; Deep belief networks (DBNs),ARTIFICIAL NEURAL-NETWORKS; MODEL; ALGORITHM; PRECIPITATION; PREDICTION; ARIMA,,PEERJ INC,LONDON,"341-345 OLD ST, THIRD FLR, LONDON, EC1V 9LL, ENGLAND",2376-5992,,,PEERJ COMPUT SCI,PeerJ Comput.

171,Forecasting Temporal and Spatial Climatological Influence for Land Suitability Evaluation in Bentota Sri Lanka,"Climate change has raised much concern regarding its impacts on future land use planning, varying by region, time, and socio-economic development path. The principle purpose of land suitability evaluation is to predict the potential and limitation of the land for crop production and other land uses. This study was carried out to predict the temperature and rainfall trends as one of the major factor for evaluating land suitability. Climatic data such as monthly mean temperature, total monthly rainfall, maximum daily rainfall and total annual rainfall during last 30 years of all weather stations located in Bentota River basin was collected and analyzed applying time series analysis, correlation analysis and Manna Kendall trend test methods. Spatial distribution of forecast rainfall values was illustrated applying Arc GIS software. The findings revealed that monthly mean temperature and maximum daily rainfall had a general increasing trend whereas, total monthly rainfall and total annual rainfall showed a general decreasing trend in Bentota area. It was indicated relatively high rainfall situations during May and October while low rainfall situations during January and February by occurring flood situation in once per five year. During Yala season the area will be received comparatively more rainfall (331mm) than Maha season (300mm) in future. Community and the farmers in this area can be aware about the anticipated spatial distribution of total monthly rainfall during two major seasons and flood occurrence periods. Decision makers should evaluate land suitability of Bentota area by considering above climatological influences and its spatial distribution pattern that identified as major outcome of this research. The approach and the methodology adopted in this study will be useful for other researchers, agriculturalist and planners to identify the future climatological influences and its spatial distribution pattern for land suitability evaluations and other decision making purposes for other areas.",https://doi.org/10.11113/ijbes.v4.n1.158,10.11113/ijbes.v4.n1.158,"Ranasinghe, Gayani; Piyadasa, Ranjana U.

172,Ensemble Streamflow Forecasting across the US Mid-Atlantic Region with a Distributed Hydrological Model Forced by GEFS Reforecasts,"The quality of ensemble streamflow forecasts in the U.S. mid-Atlantic region (MAR) is investigated for short-to medium-range forecast lead times (6-168 h). To this end, a regional hydrological ensemble prediction system (RHEPS) is assembled and implemented. The RHEPS in this case comprises the ensemble meteorological forcing, a distributed hydrological model, and a statistical postprocessor. As the meteorological forcing, precipitation, and near-surface temperature outputs from the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA)/National Centers for Environmental Prediction (NCEP) 11-member Global Ensemble Forecast System Reforecast, version 2 (GEFSRv2), are used. The Hydrology Laboratory Research Distributed Hydrologic Model (HL-RDHM) is used as the distributed hydrological model, and a statistical autoregressive model with an exogenous variable is used as the postprocessor. To verify streamflow forecasts from the RHEPS, eight river basins in the MAR are selected, ranging in drainage area from; 262 to 29 965 km(2) and covering some of the major rivers in the MAR. The verification results for the RHEPS show that, at the initial lead times (1-3 days), the hydrological uncertainties have more impact on forecast skill than the meteorological ones. The former become less pronounced, and the meteorological uncertainties dominate, across longer lead times (> 3 days). Nonetheless, the ensemble streamflow forecasts remain skillful for lead times of up to 7 days. Additionally, postprocessing increases forecast skills across lead times and spatial scales, particularly for the high-flow conditions. Overall, the proposed RHEPS is able to improve streamflow forecasting in the MAR relative to the deterministic (unperturbed GEFSRv2 member) forecasting case.",https://doi.org/10.1175/JHM-D-16-0243.1,10.1175/JHM-D-16-0243.1,"Siddique, Ridwan; Mejia, Alfonso",JOURNAL OF HYDROMETEOROLOGY,,FLOOD ALERT SYSTEM; BIAS-CORRECTION; PROBABILISTIC FORECASTS; AUTOMATIC CALIBRATION; PREDICTION SYSTEM; RUNOFF MODELS; SKILL; WATER; SATELLITE; WEATHER,,AMER METEOROLOGICAL SOC,BOSTON,"45 BEACON ST, BOSTON, MA 02108-3693 USA",1525-755X,1525-7541,,J HYDROMETEOROL,J.

173,Differing roles of base and fast flow in ensemble seasonal streamflow forecasting: An experimental investigation,"Seasonal streamflow forecasting, which is important for water resources management, is generally a challenging task in hydrology. This paper focuses on the consideration of base and fast flow for the forecasting of seasonal streamflow. Taking the three tributaries of the Pearl River in South China as case study, five forecasting experiments, which forecast the average daily flow in the three-month period by using the average daily flow in the antecedent month, are devised to elucidate the different roles of base, fast, and total flow. The recursive digital filter (RDF) model is employed for the separation of base flow from fast flow; the Bayesian joint probability (BJP) model is applied to generate ensemble forecasts under cross validation; and the Schaake shuffle is used to establish temporal structure to link ensemble members when adding up forecasts of base flow and fast flow. Forecasts in the different experiments are evaluated in terms of bias, reliability, and skill, and the relationship between correlation coefficient and forecast skill is illustrated. The results show that unbiased and reliable seasonal forecasts are generally obtained in the experiments. Correlation coefficients of base flow are overall higher than those of total flow while correlation coefficients of fast flow are lower. Forecast skill tends to increase with correlation coefficient. Meanwhile, fast flow can lead to extremely large total flow in the antecedent month, which can substantially enlarge the forecasts and diminish the forecast skill when the corresponding observation is not as large. By contrast, base flow tends to always contribute to forecast skill. The separation of base flow from fast flow, which accounts for the different dynamical processes of fast and base flow, can reduce the impact of fast flow and improve the forecast skill of total flow.",https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jhydrol.2020.125272,10.1016/j.jhydrol.2020.125272,"Huang, Zeqing; Zhao, Tongtiegang; Liu, Yang; Zhang, Yongyong; Jiang, Tao; Lin, Kairong; Chen, Xiaohong",JOURNAL OF HYDROLOGY,Streamflow forecasting; Seasonal flow; Base flow; Fast flow; Forecast skill,RECURSIVE DIGITAL-FILTERS; CLIMATE FORECASTS; SCHAAKE SHUFFLE; RIVER-BASIN; MODELS; SEPARATION; PREDICTION; RAINFALL; PRECIPITATION; TEMPERATURE,,ELSEVIER,AMSTERDAM,"RADARWEG 29, 1043 NX AMSTERDAM, NETHERLANDS",0022-1694,1879-2707,,J HYDROL,J.

174,Improving the prediction accuracy of monthly streamflow using a data-driven model based on a double-processing strategy,"Streamflow forecasting has great significance in water resource management, particularly for reservoir operation. However, accurately predicting streamflow is challenging due to the non-stationary characteristics of hydrologic processes and the effects of noise. To improve monthly streamflow forecasting, this study proposes a data-driven model based on a double-processing strategy, which combines singular spectrum analysis (SSA), improved complete ensemble empirical mode decomposition with adaptive noise (ICEEMDAN) and extreme learning machine (ELM) approaches. In the proposed double-processing model, called SSA-ICEEMDAN-ELM, the original streamflow series are first processed via SSA for denoising; then, the processed series are reprocessed via ICEEMDAN to decompose them into relatively stationary sub-series; finally, these sub-series are modelled using ELM. The performance of the proposed model is tested for one-month-ahead prediction using streamflow data from the Caojiahu and Shibalipu reservoirs in the Gulang River Basin. In addition, the proposed double-processing model is compared with four single-processing models, namely, empirical mode decomposition (EMD)-ELM, ensemble EMD (EEMD)-ELM, ICEEMDAN-ELM and SSA-ELM, and two single models without any processing, namely, autoregressive integrated moving average (ARIMA) and ELM. The results show that: (a) the four single-processing models have higher prediction accuracy than the single models, and the performance of the SSA-ELM model is the best of these single-processing models, implying that noise in hydrological series cannot be ignored; (b) the proposed SSA-ICEEMDAN-ELM model is superior to the single-processing models and single models, demonstrating that the double-processing approach can further improve streamflow prediction accuracy. Thus, the proposed model, which is a promising method that is expected to benefit reservoir management, can better reduce the influence of noise and capture the dynamic characteristics of hydrological series.",https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jhydrol.2019.03.101,10.1016/j.jhydrol.2019.03.101,"Wang, Lili; Li, Xin; Ma, Chunfeng; Bai, Yulong",JOURNAL OF HYDROLOGY,Streamflow prediction; Data-driven model; Extreme learning machine; Singular spectrum analysis; Empirical mode decomposition,EXTREME LEARNING-MACHINE; SINGULAR SPECTRUM ANALYSIS; HYBRID MODEL; FORECASTING ACCURACY; WAVELET; ALGORITHM; REGION; EMD,,ELSEVIER SCIENCE BV,AMSTERDAM,"PO BOX 211, 1000 AE AMSTERDAM, NETHERLANDS",0022-1694,1879-2707,,J HYDROL,J.

175,"Seasonal Inflow Forecasts Based on Non-Homogeneous Hidden Markov Models: The Case of Oros Reservoir, Northeastern Brazil","This study explores the use of non-homogeneous hidden Markov models (NHMMs) to forecast streamflows into the Oros Reservoir, located in the State of Ceara, Northeastern Brazil. These models employ hydro-climatic information from a given year to predict the next year inflow. The Oros Reservoir is a key infrastructure in the water resources system of the state, where most rivers present very high temporal variability, which is a challenge for water managers. Streamflow forecast systems at the climate scale (months ahead) can be very useful for the challenging process of water allocation in the region. This paper explores the use of NHMMs to provide a probabilistic one-year ahead forecast of the mean annual flow for the Oros Reservoir. Results based on a forecast verification study based on 60 years of independent data show that NHMMs with two or three hidden states, employing the NINO3 climate index as exogenous variable, provides forecasts with an average value of the continuous ranked probability skill score of about 0.2-0.25, meaning that they are better than climatology. It is also evident that those models performed much better during dry years than during wet years, which may be related to lack of other climate indices.",https://doi.org/,,"Hernandez Hernandez, Luis Carlos; Reis, Dirceu Silveira, Jr.","WORLD ENVIRONMENTAL AND WATER RESOURCES CONGRESS 2018: WATERSHED MANAGEMENT, IRRIGATION AND DRAINAGE, AND WATER RESOURCES PLANNING AND MANAGEMENT",,SOUTHERN-OSCILLATION; RAINFALL ANOMALIES; PRECIPITATION,,AMER SOC CIVIL ENGINEERS,NEW YORK,"UNITED ENGINEERING CENTER, 345 E 47TH ST, NEW YORK, NY 10017-2398 USA",,,978-0-7844-8140-0,,,,2018,,,269,277,,
176,Performance comparison between genetic programming and sediment rating curve for suspended sediment prediction,"The accurate prediction of suspended sediment flowing into reservoirs is very important during their design and operation stage. It is also of great significance in environmental engineering, hydroelectric equipment longevity, river aesthetics, pollution and channel navigability. Hence the development of methods that can accurately forecast the suspended sediment loads from historical water data sets and infrequently or non-sampled rivers will greatly help in the management of water resources. One of the widely used methods employing empirical models are rating curves. Therefore, in this study, 12 sediment rating curves (SRCs) were developed from 14 years' historical data, one for each month of the year, to show the relationship between stream and suspended sediment flowing into Inanda Dam, Durban, South Africa. The developed monthly SRCs were evaluated using two performance assessment criteria, specifically RMSE and R-2. The performance of these SRC models was compared with those of the corresponding monthly developed genetic programming (GP) models for each month of the year. The results indicate that the predictions from the GP models are better than the predictions from the SRC models, especially in predicting large quantities of suspended sediment load during high streamflow such as during flood events.",https://doi.org/10.1080/20421338.2019.1587908,10.1080/20421338.2019.1587908,"Jaiyeola, Adesoji Tunbosun; Adeyemo, Josiah",AFRICAN JOURNAL OF SCIENCE TECHNOLOGY INNOVATION & DEVELOPMENT,suspended sediment; streamflow; genetic programming; sediment rating curve; Inanda Dam; South Africa,NEURAL-NETWORK; RIVER; TRANSPORT; BASIN; FLUX; WADI,,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",2042-1338,2042-1346,,AFR J SCI TECHNOL IN,Afr.

177,Seasonal streamflow forecasting in the upper Indus Basin of Pakistan: an assessment of methods,"Timely and skilful seasonal streamflow forecasts are used by water managers in many regions of the world for seasonal water allocation outlooks for irrigators, reservoir operations, environmental flow management, water markets and drought response strategies. In Australia, the Bayesian joint probability (BJP) statistical approach has been deployed by the Australian Bureau of Meteorology to provide seasonal streamflow forecasts across the country since 2010. Here we assess the BJP approach, using antecedent conditions and climate indices as predictors, to produce Kharif season (April-September) streamflow forecasts for inflow to Pakistan's two largest upper Indus Basin (UIB) water supply dams, Tarbela (on the Indus) and Mangla (on the Jhelum). For Mangla, we compare these BJP forecasts to (i) ensemble streamflow predictions (ESPs) from the snowmelt runoff model (SRM) and (ii) a hybrid approach using the BJP with SRM-ESP forecast means as an additional predictor. For Tarbela, we only assess BJP forecasts using antecedent and climate predictors as we did not have access to SRM for this location. Cross validation of the streamflow forecasts shows that the BJP approach using two predictors (March flow and an El Nino Southern Oscillation, ENSO, climate index) provides skilful probabilistic forecasts that are reliable in uncertainty spread for both Mangla and Tarbela. For Mangla, the SRM approach leads to forecasts that exhibit some bias and are unreliable in uncertainty spread, and the hybrid approach does not result in better forecast skill. Skill levels for Kharif (April-September), early Kharif (April-June) and late Kharif (July-September) BJP forecasts vary between the two locations. Forecasts for Mangla show high skill for early Kharif and moderate skill for all Kharif and late Kharif, whereas forecasts for Tarbela also show moderate skill for all Kharif and late Kharif, but low skill for early Kharif. The BJP approach is simple to apply, with small input data requirements and automated calibration and forecast generation. It offers a tool for rapid deployment at many locations across the UIB to provide probabilistic seasonal streamflow forecasts that can inform Pakistan's basin water management.",https://doi.org/10.5194/hess-22-3533-2018,10.5194/hess-22-3533-2018,"Charles, Stephen P.; Wang, Quan J.; Ahmad, Mobin-ud-Din; Hashmi, Danial; Schepen, Andrew; Podger, Geoff; Robertson, David E.",HYDROLOGY AND EARTH SYSTEM SCIENCES,,CENTRAL-SOUTHWEST ASIA; INDIAN-OCEAN DIPOLE; PROBABILISTIC FORECASTS; WINTER PRECIPITATION; RIVER-BASIN; SNOWMELT-RUNOFF; UNITED-STATES; KHARIF FLOWS; CLIMATE; MODEL,,COPERNICUS GESELLSCHAFT MBH,GOTTINGEN,"BAHNHOFSALLEE 1E, GOTTINGEN, 37081, GERMANY",1027-5606,1607-7938,,HYDROL EARTH SYST SC,Hydrol.

178,Mitigating the Impacts of Climate Nonstationarity on Seasonal Streamflow Predictability in the US Southwest,"Seasonal streamflow predictions provide a critical management tool for water managers in the American Southwest. In recent decades, persistent prediction errors for spring and summer runoff volumes have been observed in a number of watersheds in the American Southwest. While mostly driven by decadal precipitation trends, these errors also relate to the influence of increasing temperature on streamflow in these basins. Here we show that incorporating seasonal temperature forecasts from operational global climate prediction models into streamflow forecasting models adds prediction skill for watersheds in the headwaters of the Colorado and Rio Grande River basins. Current dynamical seasonal temperature forecasts now show sufficient skill to reduce streamflow forecast errors in snowmelt-driven regions. Such predictions can increase the resilience of streamflow forecasting and water management systems in the face of continuing warming as well as decadal-scale temperature variability and thus help to mitigate the impacts of climate nonstationarity on streamflow predictability.",https://doi.org/10.1002/2017GL076043,10.1002/2017GL076043,"Lehner, Flavio; Wood, Andrew W.; Llewellyn, Dagmar; Blatchford, Douglas B.; Goodbody, Angus G.; Pappenberger, Florian",GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH LETTERS,streamflow prediction and forecasting; climate prediction; temperature; nonstationarity; water resources; snowmelt-driven hydrology,SOIL-MOISTURE; RIVER-BASIN; HYDROLOGIC SENSITIVITIES; UNITED-STATES; PREDICTION; FORECASTS; PRECIPITATION; RUNOFF; SKILL; STATIONARITY,,AMER GEOPHYSICAL UNION,WASHINGTON,"2000 FLORIDA AVE NW, WASHINGTON, DC 20009 USA",0094-8276,1944-8007,,GEOPHYS RES LETT,Geophys.

179,Climate-driven Model Based on Long Short-Term Memory and Bayesian Optimization for Multi-day-ahead Daily Streamflow Forecasting,"Many previous studies have developed decomposition and ensemble models to improve runoff forecasting performance. However, these decomposition-based models usually introduce large decomposition errors into the modeling process. Since the variation in runoff time series is greatly driven by climate change, many previous studies considering climate change focused on only rainfall-runoff modeling, with few meteorological factors as input. Therefore, a climate-driven streamflow forecasting (CDSF) framework was proposed to improve the runoff forecasting accuracy. This framework is realized by using principal component analysis (PCA), long short-term memory (LSTM) and Bayesian optimization (BO), referred to as PCA-LSTM-BO. To validate the effectiveness and superiority of the PCA-LSTM-BO method along with one autoregressive LSTM model and two other CDSF models based on PCA, BO, and either support vector regression (SVR) or gradient boosting regression trees (GBRT), namely, PCA-SVR-BO and PCA-GBRT-BO, respectively, were compared. A generalization performance index based on the Nash-Sutcliffe efficiency (NSE), called the GI(NSE) value, is proposed to evaluate the generalizability of the model. The results show that (1) the proposed model is significantly better than the other benchmark models in terms of the mean square error (MSE<=185.782), NSE>=0.819, and GI(NSE) <=0.223 for all the forecasting scenarios; (2) the PCA in the CDSF framework can improve the forecasting capacity and generalizability; (3) the CDSF framework is superior to the autoregressive LSTM models for all the forecasting scenarios; and (4) the GI(NSE) value is demonstrated to be effective in selecting the optimal model with better generalizability.",https://doi.org/10.1007/s11269-021-03002-2,10.1007/s11269-021-03002-2,"Lian, Yani; Luo, Jungang; Wang, Jingmin; Zuo, Ganggang; Wei, Na",WATER RESOURCES MANAGEMENT,Climate-driven model; Streamflow forecasting; Long short-term memory; Bayesian optimization; Principal component analysis,SUPPORT VECTOR REGRESSION; DECOMPOSITION; PREDICTION; ALGORITHM,,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0920-4741,1573-1650,,WATER RESOUR MANAG,Water Resour.

180,Ultra-high resolution regional climate projections for assessing changes in hydrological extremes and underlying uncertainties,"The frequency and intensity of extreme hydrological events (droughts and floods) have been increasing over the past few decades, which has been posing a threat to water security and agriculture production. Thus, projecting the future evolution of hydrological extremes plays a crucial role in sustainable water management and agriculture development in a changing climate. In this study, we develop the high-resolution projections of multidimensional drought characteristics and flood risks using the convection-permitting Weather Research and Forecasting (WRF) model with the horizontal grid spacing of 4 km for the Blanco and Mission River basins over South Texas. Uncertainties in model parameters are addressed explicitly, thereby leading to probabilistic assessments of hydrological extremes. Our findings reveal that the probabilistic multivariate assessments of drought and flood risks can reduce the underestimation and the biased conclusions generated from the univariate assessment. Furthermore, our findings disclose that future droughts are expected to become more severe over South Texas even though the frequency of the occurrence of droughts is projected to decrease, especially for the long-term drought episodes. In addition, South Texas region is expected to experience more floods with an increasing river discharge. Moreover, the Blanco and Mission river basins will suffer from higher flood risks as flood return periods are expected to become longer under climate change.",https://doi.org/10.1007/s00382-020-05372-6,10.1007/s00382-020-05372-6,"Qing, Y.; Wang, S.; Zhang, B.; Wang, Y.",CLIMATE DYNAMICS,Regional climate projection; Hydrological extremes; Drought; Flood; Copula,RIVER-BASIN; DROUGHT INDEX; MODEL; PRECIPITATION; SIMULATIONS; SENSITIVITY; PROVINCE,,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"ONE NEW YORK PLAZA, SUITE 4600, NEW YORK, NY, UNITED STATES",0930-7575,1432-0894,,CLIM DYNAM,Clim.

181,The effect of climate change on groundwater level and its prediction using modern meta-heuristic model,"In recent years, climate change has led to the phenomenon of global warming and the ensuing depletion of groundwater resources. Therefore, to prevent the depletion of groundwater resources in a small number of plains, it is essential that simulation and forecasting of groundwater levels be conducted. In this study, in order to predict the groundwater level of Khorramabad plain located in Iran using 5 AOGCM models under RCP85 scenario, meteorological parameters were predicted and analyzed. Then, the performances of hybrid models including Black Widow Spider-Support Vector Regression (BWO-SVR), WSVR, and AIG-SVR in estimating the groundwater level of the plain were investigated and evaluated based on the parameters of temperature, precipitation, and abstraction from the aquifers during the statistical years of 2000-2020. Upon the application of the selected hybrid model, the groundwater level was predicted within the statistical years 2021-2040. According to the results of climate change modeling, compared to the base period, the temperature parameter in future periods in all months would experience an increasing trend (about 1.68-2.79 degrees C). The results showed that the studied models have better performance in the structure consisting of all input parameters. Also, the results of the evaluation index showed that the WSVR model has less error than other models. In general, the results of groundwater level forecasting show that in the coming years, groundwater level drop is predicted to be about 1-1.5 m.",https://doi.org/10.1016/j.gsd.2021.100702,10.1016/j.gsd.2021.100702,"Dehghani, Reza; Poudeh, Hassan Torabi; Izadi, Zohre",GROUNDWATER FOR SUSTAINABLE DEVELOPMENT,Water resources decline; Climate change; Forecast; Khorramabad plain,SUPPORT VECTOR MACHINES; FUZZY INFERENCE SYSTEM; TIME-SERIES MODELS; WATER-LEVEL; NEURAL-NETWORK; WAVELET; PRECIPITATION; SIMULATION; AQUIFER; RUNOFF,,ELSEVIER,AMSTERDAM,"RADARWEG 29, 1043 NX AMSTERDAM, NETHERLANDS",2352-801X,,,GROUNDWATER SUST DEV,Groundwater Sustain.

183,A First Look at Decadal Hydrological Predictability by Land Surface Ensemble Simulations,"The prediction of terrestrial hydrology at the decadal scale is critical for managing water resources in the face of climate change. Here we conducted an assessment by global land model simulations following the design of the fifth Coupled Model Intercomparison Project (CMIP5) decadal hindcast experiments, specifically testing for the sensitivity to perfect initial or boundary conditions. The memory for terrestrial water storage (TWS) is longer than 6 years over 11% of global land areas where the deep soil moisture and aquifer water have a long memory and a nonnegligible variability. Ensemble decadal predictions based on realistic initial conditions are skillful over 31%, 43%, and 59% of global land areas for TWS, deep soil moisture, and aquifer water, respectively. The fraction of skillful predictions for TWS increases by 10%-16% when conditioned on Pacific Decadal Oscillation and Atlantic Multidecadal Oscillation indices. This study provides a first look at decadal hydrological predictability, with an improved skill when incorporating low-frequency climate information. Plain Language Summary Decadal prediction, which was initially proposed to more accurately project near-term (e.g., 10-30 years) climate change by using the experiences in weather and seasonal climate forecasting, has raised a wide concern since the IPCC CMIP5 project. The climate community is now trying to transition the decadal prediction from a pure research to a quasi-real-time operational effort. However, very limited information is known about the decadal hydrological predictability over land, which is more relevant to the livelihood and stakeholders. Here we combine an ensemble simulation method that is widely used to assess seasonal hydrological predictability, with the experimental design of the CMIP5 decadal climate hindcasts, to provide a first look at decadal hydrological predictability and skill by carrying out over 2,000 years global land model simulations. We found skillful decadal prediction for terrestrial water storage over one third land areas where deep soil moisture and aquifer have a nonnegligible variability. And the skill can be further enhanced by incorporating low-frequency teleconnection information from Atlantic and Pacific Oceans.

184,Monthly streamflow forecasting with auto-regressive integrated moving average,"Forecasting of streamflow is one of the many ways that can contribute to better decision making for water resource management. The auto-regressive integrated moving average (ARIMA) model was selected in this research for monthly streamflow forecasting with enhancement made by pre-processing the data using singular spectrum analysis (SSA). This study also proposed an extension of the SSA technique to include a step where clustering was performed on the eigenvector pairs before reconstruction of the time series. The monthly streamflow data of Sungai Muda at Jeniang, Sungai Muda at Jambatan Syed Omar and Sungai Ketil at Kuala Pegang was gathered from the Department of Irrigation and Drainage Malaysia. A ratio of 9: 1 was used to divide the data into training and testing sets. The ARIMA, SSA-ARIMA and Clustered SSA-ARIMA models were all developed in R software. Results from the proposed model are then compared to a conventional auto-regressive integrated moving average model using the root-mean-square error and mean absolute error values. It was found that the proposed model can outperform the conventional model.",https://doi.org/10.1088/1742-6596/890/1/012141,10.1088/1742-6596/890/1/012141,"Nasir, Najah; Samsudin, Ruhaidah; Shabri, Ani",1ST INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE ON APPLIED & INDUSTRIAL MATHEMATICS AND STATISTICS 2017 (ICOAIMS 2017),,SINGULAR SPECTRUM ANALYSIS,,IOP PUBLISHING LTD,BRISTOL,"DIRAC HOUSE, TEMPLE BACK, BRISTOL BS1 6BE, ENGLAND",1742-6588,1742-6596,,J PHYS CONF SER,,,2017,890,,,,12141,
185,Incorporating Multiyear Temperature Predictions for Water Resources Planning,"Multiyear climate predictions provide climate outlooks from years to a decade in advance. As multiyear temperature predictions become more mainstream and skillful, guidance is needed to assist practitioners who wish to explore this maturing field. This paper demonstrates the process and considerations of incorporating multiyear temperature predictions into water resources planning. Multiyear temperature predictions from the Community Earth System Model Decadal Prediction Large Ensemble are presented as discrete and probabilistic products and are used to force two common hydrologic modeling approaches: conceptual and empirical. The approaches are demonstrated to simulate streamflow in the upper Colorado River basin watershed in Colorado, where diagnostics show that increasing temperatures are associated with decreasing streamflows. Using temperature information for lead years 2-6, two analyses are performed: (i) a retrospective hindcast for the climatological period (1981-2010) and (ii) a blind forecast for 2011-15. For the retrospective hindcast, including temperature information improved the percent error as compared with climatology. For the blind forecast, the multiyear temperature prediction for warming was skillful, but the corresponding multiyear average streamflow predictions from both approaches were counterintuitive: with the predicted warming, the multiyear average streamflow was predicted to be lower than the climatological mean; however, the observed multiyear average streamflow was higher than the climatological mean. This was due to above-average precipitation during the prediction time frame, particularly for one of the years. With that year removed, the multiyear streamflow average became lower than the climatological mean. Temperature provides a marginal source of streamflow predictability, but there will be substantial uncertainty until prediction skill for year-to-year climate variability, especially for precipitation, increases.",https://doi.org/10.1175/JAMC-D-20-0134.1,10.1175/JAMC-D-20-0134.1,"Towler, Erin; Yates, David",JOURNAL OF APPLIED METEOROLOGY AND CLIMATOLOGY,Streamflow; Climate prediction; Forecast verification; skill; Hydrologic models,MID-1970S SHIFT; CLIMATE; MODEL; DRIVEN; SKILL; CMIP5,,AMER METEOROLOGICAL SOC,BOSTON,"45 BEACON ST, BOSTON, MA 02108-3693 USA",1558-8424,1558-8432,,J APPL METEOROL CLIM,J.

186,Desiccation resistance traits predict freshwater invertebrate survival and community response to drought scenarios in a Neotropical ecosystem,"The intensification of dry seasons is a major threat to freshwater biodiversity in Neotropical regions. Little is known about resistance to drying stress and the underpinning traits in Neotropical freshwater species, so we don't know whether desiccation resistance allows to anticipate shifts in biological diversity under future climate scenarios. Here, we used the aquatic invertebrates that live in the rainwater-filled leaves of tank bromeliads, to examine the extent to which desiccation resistance of species measured in the laboratory predicts community response to drought intensification in nature. We measured desiccation resistance in 17 invertebrate species (> 90% of the biomass usually found in bromeliads of French Guiana) by recording the median lethal time (LT50) of experimental populations exposed to controlled conditions of residual moisture. In the field, we placed rainshelters above tank bromeliads to emulate drought scenarios ranging from the ambient norm to IPCC scenarios and extreme events, and we recorded the response of functional community structure. LT50 ranged from 4.18 to 19.06 days, and was related to cuticle content and dry body mass. Among other functional indicators that represent strategies to optimize resource use under stressful conditions (e.g., habitat use, trophic specialization), LT50 was the best predictor of community structure responses along a gradient of emulated drought intensities. Therefore, species' LT5Os measured under laboratory conditions can be used to forecast aquatic community response to drying stress in nature. Anticipating how species will cope with drought has never been more important for environmental managers to support climate change adaptation. We show that desiccation resistance in freshwater invertebrates is a key indicator of potential population size and local-global range shifts, and this could be especially true in the Neotropics where species have narrow physiological tolerances for climatic variation.",https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ecolind.2020.106839,10.1016/j.ecolind.2020.106839,"Cereghino, Regis; Francoise, Lea; Bonhomme, Camille; Carrias, Jean-Francois; Compin, Arthur; Corbara, Bruno; Jassey, Vincent; Leflaive, Josephine; Rota, Thibaut; Farjalla, Vinicius; Leroy, Celine",ECOLOGICAL INDICATORS,Climate change; Functional traits; LT50; Macroinvertebrates; Rainforests,INSECTS; TOLERANCE; PATTERNS; ECOLOGY; HISTORY; BALANCE; MEDIATE; NICHES,,ELSEVIER,AMSTERDAM,"RADARWEG 29, 1043 NX AMSTERDAM, NETHERLANDS",1470-160X,1872-7034,,ECOL INDIC,Ecol.

187,Spatial Decision Making and Analysis for Flood Forecasting,"The application of flood forecasting models requires the efficient management of large spatial and temporal datasets, involving data acquisition, storage, processing, analysis and display of model results. Difficulty in linking data, analysis tools, and models is one of the barriers to be overcome in developing an integrated flood forecasting system. The current revolution in technology and the online availability of spatial data facilitate Canadians' need for information sharing in support of decision making. This need has resulted in studies demonstrating the suitability of the web as a medium for implementation of flood forecasting. Web-based Spatial Decision Support Services (WSDSS) provides comprehensive support for information retrieval, model analysis and extensive visualization functions for decision-making support and information services. This chapter develops a prototype WSDSS that integrates models, analytical tools, databases, graphical user interfaces, and spatial decision support services to help the public and decision makers to easily access flood and flood-threatened information. Flood WSDSS helps to mitigate flood disasters through river runoff prediction, flood forecasting, and flood information (flood discharge, water level and flood frequency) dissemination. The ultimate aim of this system is to improve access to flood model results by the public and decision makers.",https://doi.org/10.1007/978-3-319-42710-2_6,10.1007/978-3-319-42710-2_6,"Wang, Lei; Zhang, Xin",MODELING WITH DIGITAL OCEAN AND DIGITAL COAST,Flood forecasting; GIS; Web; Spatial decision support system,,,SPRINGER-VERLAG BERLIN,BERLIN,"HEIDELBERGER PLATZ 3, D-14197 BERLIN, GERMANY",2211-0577,,978-3-319-42710-2; 978-3-319-42708-9,COAST RES LIBR,,,2017,18,,113,126,,
188,The Coupling of NSSL Warn-on-Forecast and FLASH Systems for Probabilistic Flash Flood Prediction,"The goal of the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration's (NOAA) Warn-on-Forecast (WoF) program is to provide frequently updating, probabilistic model guidance that will enable National Weather Service (NWS) forecasters to produce more continuous communication of hazardous weather threats (e.g., heavy rainfall, flash floods, damaging wind, large hail, and tornadoes) between the watch and warning temporal and spatial scales. To evaluate the application of this WoF concept for probabilistic short-term flash flood prediction, the 0-3-h rainfall forecasts from NOAA National Severe Storms Laboratory's (NSSL) experimental WoF System (WoFS) were integrated as the forcing to the NWS operational hydrologic modeling core within the Flooded Locations and Simulated Hydrographs (FLASH) system. Initial assessment of the potential impacts of probabilistic short-term flash flood forecasts from this coupled atmosphere-hydrology (WoFS-FLASH) modeling system were evaluated in the 2018 Hydrometeorology Testbed Multi-Radar Multi-Sensor Hydrology experiment held in Norman, Oklahoma. During the 3-week experiment period, a total of nine NWS forecasters analyzed three retrospective flash flood events in archive mode. This study will describe specifically what information participants extracted from the WoFS-FLASH products during these three archived events, and how this type of information is expected to impact operational decision-making processes. Overall feedback from the testbed participants' evaluations show promise for the coupled NSSL WoFS-FLASH system probabilistic flash flood model guidance to enable earlier assessment and detection of flash flood threats and to advance the current warning lead time for these events.",https://doi.org/10.1175/JHM-D-19-0131.1,10.1175/JHM-D-19-0131.1,"Yussouf, Nusrat; Wilson, Katie A.; Martinaitis, Steven M.; Vergara, Humberto; Heinselman, Pam L.; Gourley, Jonathan J.",JOURNAL OF HYDROMETEOROLOGY,Hydrometeorology; Operational forecasting; Probabilistic Quantitative Precipitation Forecasting (PQPF); Cloud resolving models; Communications; decision making; Flood events,DATA ASSIMILATION; ENSEMBLE; VERIFICATION,,AMER METEOROLOGICAL SOC,BOSTON,"45 BEACON ST, BOSTON, MA 02108-3693 USA",1525-755X,1525-7541,,J HYDROMETEOROL,J.

Because of the complexity of flood forecasting, hydrological models and statistical models need to be developed for flood frequency analysis, river runoff prediction, and flood forecasting. In this chapter, Soil Conservation Service (SCS) Curve Number (CN) model is applied for river runoff prediction in the Oak Ridges Moraine (ORM) area, southern Ontario.

190,Uncertainty assessment of the multilayer perceptron (MLP) neural network model with implementation of the novel hybrid MLP-FFA method for prediction of biochemical oxygen demand and dissolved oxygen: a case study of Langat River,"Accurate prediction of the chemical constituents in major river systems is a necessary task for water quality management, aquatic life well-being and the overall healthcare planning of river systems. In this study, the capability of a newly proposed hybrid forecasting model based on the firefly algorithm (FFA) as a metaheuristic optimizer, integrated with the multilayer perceptron (MLP-FFA), is investigated for the prediction of monthly water quality in Langat River basin, Malaysia. The predictive ability of the MLP-FFA model is assessed against the MLP-based model. To validate the proposed MLP-FFA model, monthly water quality data over a 10-year duration (2001-2010) for two different hydrological stations (1L04 and 1L05) provided by the Irrigation and Drainage Ministry of Malaysia are used to predict the biochemical oxygen demand (BOD) and dissolved oxygen (DO). The input variables are the chemical oxygen demand (COD), total phosphate (PO4), total solids, potassium (K), sodium (Na), chloride (Cl), electrical conductivity (EC), pH and ammonia nitrogen (NH4-N). The proposed hybrid model is then evaluated in accordance with statistical metrics such as the correlation coefficient (r), root-mean-square error, % root-mean-square error and Willmott's index of agreement. Analysis of the results shows that MLP-FFA outperforms the equivalent MLP model. Also, in this research, the uncertainty of a MLP neural network model is analyzed in relation to the predictive ability of the MLP model. To assess the uncertainties within the MLP model, the percentage of observed data bracketed by 95 percent predicted uncertainties (95PPU) and the band width of 95 percent confidence intervals (d-factors) are selected. The effect of input variables on BOD and DO prediction is also investigated through sensitivity analysis. The obtained values bracketed by 95PPU show about 77.7%, 72.2% of data for BOD and 72.2%, 91.6% of data for DO related to the 1L04 and 1L05 stations, respectively. The d-factors have a value of 1.648, 2.269 for BOD and 1.892, 3.480 for DO related to the 1L04 and 1L05 stations, respectively. Based on the values in both stations for the 95PPU and d-factor, it is concluded that the neural network model has an acceptably low degree of uncertainty applied for BOD and DO simulations. The findings of this study can have important implications for error assessment in artificial intelligence-based predictive models applied for water resources management and the assessment of the overall health in major river systems.",https://doi.org/10.1007/s12665-017-6842-z,10.1007/s12665-017-6842-z,"Raheli, Bahare; Aalami, Mohammad Taghi; El-Shafie, Ahmed; Ghorbani, Mohammad Ali; Deo, Ravinesh C.",ENVIRONMENTAL EARTH SCIENCES,BOD and DO; Multilayer perceptron (MLP); Firefly algorithm; Hybrid model; Uncertainty assessment; River water quality,MODIFIED FIREFLY ALGORITHM; INPUT VARIABLE SELECTION; SUPPORT VECTOR MACHINE; MONTE-CARLO-SIMULATION; WATER-QUALITY; OPTIMIZATION; SENSITIVITY; PERFORMANCE,,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"ONE NEW YORK PLAZA, SUITE 4600, NEW YORK, NY, UNITED STATES",1866-6280,1866-6299,,ENVIRON EARTH SCI,Environ.

191,Temperature and hydrologic alteration predict the spread of invasive Largemouth Bass (Micropterus salmoides),"The successful establishment of an aquatic invasive alien species can be mediated by a suite of environmental factors, including climate and anthropogenic disturbance. Dams and reservoirs are thought to promote freshwater fish invasion success through hydrological alterations but the evidence for their role in the global invasion of Largemouth Bass (Micropterus salmoides) on a landscape scale is limited. Here, we examine the distribution of Largemouth Bass, one of the most widely introduced fish in the world, from the Iberian Peninsula using species distribution models (SDMs), including an ensemble forecast. We used these models to test the role of twelve environmental predictors expected to influence the distribution of Largemouth Bass, including the reservoir storage capacity at local and upstream reaches. We found that the predictive accuracy, based on AUC criteria, of the ensemble model was higher than any of the six individual SDMs for Largemouth Bass. The most influential predictor of bass distribution included in our model of the Iberian Peninsula was temperature, where warmer temperatures were generally associated with bass presence, and cooler temperatures with absence. In addition to warmer temperatures, increasing storage of local and upstream reservoirs increased predicted presence, suggesting an important role of reservoirs in mediating the invasive success of this fish. Our results indicate that although natural climatic factors may be crucial in the successful invasion of Largemouth Bass, hydrological alteration (e.g., regulated flow regimes and lentic habitats associated with dams and reservoirs) may be important. Understanding the drivers promoting the establishment of this global invader will be important in identifying areas at risk and in developing future efforts to control its spread, especially when those drivers are ongoing anthropogenic disturbances such as the construction and operation of dams and reservoirs.

192,Projected spatial patterns in precipitation and air temperature for China's northwest region derived from high-resolution regional climate models,"Derived from realistic global warming scenarios, long-term projections of spatial patterns in precipitation and temperature in hydrology and climatology can serve to evaluate climate risk, explore sources of renewable energies and allow local-scale data to inform decisions regarding agricultural, ecosystem, social, recreational and economic activities. Under the CORDEX-EA project, the precipitation and temperature projections (2020-2045) for the economically and socially important region of Northwestern China were derived from high-resolution regional climate model (RCM) simulations for RCP 4.5 and 8.5 scenarios, and compared against a historical period or baseline of 1980-2005. Drawing data from four key RCMs [Weather Research and Forecasting (WRF); Regional Spectral Model (RSM); Regional Climate Model version 4.0 (RegCM4); Mesoscale Model version 5 (MM5)], reliable local-scale projections were generated by applying suitable bias correction that accords with the multivariate bias correction (MBC) approach. To validate this approach and then evaluate climate change impacts, the adjusted precipitation and temperature estimated from bias-corrected models for the historical period were compared to the observed data. The results showed that the simulated spatiotemporal distribution of multiyear average precipitation and temperature appear to fit relatively well with the observations, however, the wet-cold and dry-warm climate-related biases were still evident for the high altitude regions. Bias-corrected future projections of RCMs indicated spatially averaged annual precipitation is expected to rise by about 23.6 and 35.3 mm under the RCP 4.5 and 8.5 scenarios, respectively, while spatially averaged annual temperature is expected to rise by about 1.95 and 1.10 degrees C. Precipitation is projected to increase in all seasons, albeit, more so in the cold season (i.e., boreal winter and spring) than the warm season (i.e., boreal summer and autumn). The annual increase is expected to be about 56.7% under the RCP 4.5 scenario, compared to 67.6% under the RCP 8.5 scenario. The changes of mean temperature in winter are expected to be significant, -37.8% under both RCP scenarios. For spring, the mean temperature will rise by 23.1% (28.9%) under the RCP 4.5 (8.5) scenario. A MBC approach was found to be effective in yielding reliable projected changes in precipitation and temperature variables. The proposed approach has important implications for climatological studies and evaluation of climate change impacts on localized regions, not only in China, but also in other similar areas of the world, where decisions for managing climate risk must be implemented by policy makers, government, industry and stakeholders.",https://doi.org/10.1002/joc.6435,10.1002/joc.6435,"Yin, Zhenliang; Feng, Qi; Yang, Linshan; Deo, Ravinesh C.; Adamowski, Jan F.; Wen, Xiaohu; Jia, Bing; Si, Jianhua",INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF CLIMATOLOGY,climate change; CORDEX-EA; northwestern China; precipitation and temperature projection; regional climate models,CMIP5 MULTIMODEL ENSEMBLE; 2.0 DEGREES-C; SUMMER MONSOON; FUTURE CHANGES; WATER-RESOURCES; BIAS CORRECTION; CHANGE IMPACTS; EXTREME TEMPERATURE; SYSTEMATIC BIASES; DOWNSCALING MODEL,,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0899-8418,1097-0088,,INT J CLIMATOL,Int.

193,"The Influence of Weather Forecast Resolution on the Circulation of Lake George, NY","Global warming is expected to greatly impact the thermal conditions of inland water bodies. Publicly available weather forecasts sufficiently resolve weather patterns above large lakes to satisfactorily force a lake hydrodynamics model, we suspect this is not the case for smaller lakes. We address this issue using weather outputs from a numerical weather prediction model at three different resolutions (3 km, 1 and 0.33 km) to force a hydrodynamics model of Lake George, NY for the month of June 2017. We find that increasing the resolution of the weather model improves the accuracy of the simulation, in part through a significant increase in total heat content of the lake. This warming is linked to an increase in downward heat transfer from the atmosphere in the higher resolution experiment, especially in the northern part of the lake where the lake is less than 2 km wide and the simulated surface winds are stronger. Interrogation of the weather model shows the stronger winds originate from a better representation of the land-lake interface (and thereby surface roughness length) at higher resolution. At the end of the one month simulation, we find the hypolimnetic volume of Lake George has reduced by 15% in the 0.33 km experiment compared to the 3 km experiment. If this discrepancy were systemic it would have obvious consequences for predicting the ecoysystem function over an extended period of small-to-medium sized lakes.",https://doi.org/10.1029/2020WR029552,10.1029/2020WR029552,"Auger, Guillaume A.

194,Multivariate bias corrections of mechanistic water quality model predictions,"Water quality networks usually do not include observations on a continuous timescale over a long period. Statistical models that use streamflow and mechanistic models that use meteorological information and land-use are commonly employed to develop continuous streamflow and nutrient records. Given the availability of long meteorological records, mechanistic models have the potential to develop continuous water quality records, but such predictions suffer from systematic biases on both streamflow and water quality constituents. This study proposes a multivariate bias correction technique based on canonical correlation analysis (CCA) - a dimension reduction technique based on multivariate multiple regression - that reduces the bias in both streamflow and loadings simultaneously by preserving the cross-correlation. We compare the performance of CCA with linear regression (LR) in removing the systematic bias from the SWAT model forced with precipitation and temperature for three selected watersheds from the Southeastern US. First, we compare the performance of CCA with LR in removing the bias in SWAT model outputs in predicting the observed streamflow and total nitrogen (TN) loadings from the Water Quality Network (WQN) dataset. We also evaluate the potential of CCA in removing the bias in SWAT model predictions at daily and monthly time scales by considering the LOADEST model predicted loadings as the predictand for CCA and LR. Evaluation of CCA with the observed dataset and at daily and streamflow time scales shows that the proposed multivariate technique not only reduces the bias in the cross-correlation between streamflow and loadings, but also improves the joint probability of estimating observed streamflow and loadings. Potential implications of the proposed bias-correction technique, CCA, in water quality forecasting and management are also discussed.",https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jhydrol.2018.07.043,10.1016/j.jhydrol.2018.07.043,"Libera, Dominic A.; Sankarasubramanian, A.",JOURNAL OF HYDROLOGY,Multivariate; Bias correction; Mechanistic models; Water quality modeling,LAND-USE CHANGES; CONTERMINOUS UNITED-STATES; SWAT MODEL; CONSTITUENT LOADS; STATISTICAL-MODEL; ASSESSMENT-TOOL; MONITORING DATA; CHESAPEAKE BAY; NUTRIENT LOADS; CLIMATE,,ELSEVIER SCIENCE BV,AMSTERDAM,"PO BOX 211, 1000 AE AMSTERDAM, NETHERLANDS",0022-1694,1879-2707,,J HYDROL,J.

195,Bayesian Model Averaging: A Unique Model Enhancing Forecasting Accuracy for Daily Streamflow Based on Different Antecedent Time Series,"Streamflow forecasting is a vital task for hydrology and water resources engineering, and the different artificial intelligence (AI) approaches have been employed for this purposes until now. Additionally, the forecasting accuracy and uncertainty estimation are the meaningful assignments that need to be recognized. The addressed research investigates the potential of novel ensemble approach, Bayesian model averaging (BMA), in streamflow forecasting using daily time series data from two stations (i.e., Hongcheon and Jucheon), South Korea. Six categories (i.e., M1-M6) of input combination using different antecedent times were employed for streamflow forecasting. The outcomes of BMA model were compared with those of multivariate adaptive regression spline (MARS), M5 model tree (M5Tree), and Kernel extreme learning machines (KELM) models considering four assessment indexes, root mean square error (RMSE), Nash-Sutcliffe efficiency (NSE), correlation coefficient (R), and mean absolute error (MAE). The results revealed the superior accuracy of BMA model over three machine learning models in daily streamflow forecasting. Considering RMSE values among the best models during testing phase, the best BMA model (i.e., BMA2) enhanced the forecasting accuracy of MARS1, M5Tree4, and KELM3 models by 5.2%, 5.8%, and 3.4% in Hongcheon station. Additionally, the best BMA model (i.e., BMA1) improved the forecasting accuracy of MARS1, M5Tree1, and KELM1 models by 6.7%, 9.5%, and 3.7% in Jucheon station. In addition, the best BMA models in both stations allowed the uncertainty estimation, and produced higher uncertainty of peak flows compared to that of low flows. As one of the most robust and effective tools, therefore, the BMA model can be successfully employed for streamflow forecasting with different antecedent times.",https://doi.org/10.3390/su12229720,10.3390/su12229720,"Kim, Sungwon; Alizamir, Meysam; Kim, Nam Won; Kisi, Ozgur",SUSTAINABILITY,streamflow forecasting; Bayesian model averaging; multivariate adaptive regression spline; M5 model tree; Kernel extreme learning machines; South Korea,EXTREME LEARNING-MACHINE; ADAPTIVE REGRESSION SPLINES; ABSOLUTE ERROR MAE; NEURAL-NETWORKS; RIVER; RUNOFF; DECOMPOSITION; REGION; TREES; RMSE,,MDPI,BASEL,"ST ALBAN-ANLAGE 66, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND",,2071-1050,,SUSTAINABILITY-BASEL,Sustainability,NOV,2020,12,22,,,9720,
196,Trend analysis and forecasting of the Gokirmak River streamflow (Turkey),The objective of this paper is to determine the trend and to estimate the streamflow of the Gokirmak River. The possible trend of the streamflow was forecasted using an autoregressive integrated moving average (ARIMA) model. Time series and trend analyses were performed using monthly streamflow data for the period between 1999 and 2014. Pettitt's change point analysis was employed to detect the time of change for historical streamflow time series. Kendall's tau and Spearman's rho tests were also conducted. The results of the change point analysis determined the change point as 2008. The time series analysis showed that the streamflow of the river had a decreasing trend from the past to the present. Results of the trend analysis forecasted a decreasing trend for the streamflow in the future. The decreasing trend in the streamflow may be related to climate change. This paper provides preliminary knowledge of the streamflow trend for the Gokirmak River.,https://doi.org/10.1515/ohs-2020-0021,10.1515/ohs-2020-0021,"Arslan, Gokhan; Kale, Semih; Sonmez, Adem Yavuz",OCEANOLOGICAL AND HYDROBIOLOGICAL STUDIES,climate change; flow monitoring; forecast; river; water resources; seasonal; ARIMA,CLIMATE-CHANGE IMPACTS; WATER-QUALITY; MANN-KENDALL; BASIN; RESERVOIR; MAXIMUM; RUNOFF; VARIABILITY; DISCHARGE; VARIABLES,,WALTER DE GRUYTER GMBH,BERLIN,"GENTHINER STRASSE 13, D-10785 BERLIN, GERMANY",1730-413X,1897-3191,,OCEANOL HYDROBIOL ST,Oceanol.

197,An assessment of the predictability of column minimum dissolved oxygen concentrations in Chesapeake Bay using a machine learning model,"Subseasonal to seasonal forecasts have the potential to be a useful tool for managing estuarine fisheries and water quality, and with increasing skill at forecasting conditions at these time scales in the atmosphere and open ocean, skillful forecasts of estuarine salinity, temperature, and biogeochemistry may be possible. In this study, we use a machine learning model to assess the predictability of column minimum dissolved oxygen in Chesapeake Bay at a monthly time scale. Compared to previous models for dissolved oxygen and hypoxia, our model has the advantages of resolving spatial variability and fitting more flexible relationships between dissolved oxygen and the predictor variables. Using a concise set of predictors with established relationships with dissolved oxygen, we find that dissolved oxygen in a given month can be skillfully predicted with knowledge of stratification and mean temperature during the same month. Furthermore, the predictions generated by the model are consistent with expectations from prior knowledge and basic physics. The model reveals that accurate knowledge or skillful forecasts of the vertical density gradient is the key to successful prediction of dissolved oxygen, and prediction skill disappears if stratification is only known at the beginning of the forecast. The lost skill cannot be recovered by replacing stratification as a predictor with variables that have a lagged correlation with stratification (such as river discharge); however, skill is obtainable in many cases if stratification can be forecast with an error of less than about 1 kg m(-3). Thus, future research on hypoxia forecasting should focus on understanding and forecasting variations in stratification over subseasonal time scales (between about two weeks and two months).",https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ecss.2019.03.007,10.1016/j.ecss.2019.03.007,"Ross, Andrew C.; Stock, Charles A.",ESTUARINE COASTAL AND SHELF SCIENCE,Estuaries; Dissolved oxygen; Prediction; Stratification; USA; Chesapeake bay,WATER-QUALITY; ESTUARINE STRATIFICATION; PHYSICAL PROCESSES; CLIMATE-CHANGE; HYPOXIA; EUTROPHICATION; MANAGEMENT; NITROGEN; RESTORATION; CIRCULATION,,ACADEMIC PRESS LTD- ELSEVIER SCIENCE LTD,LONDON,"24-28 OVAL RD, LONDON NW1 7DX, ENGLAND",0272-7714,1096-0015,,ESTUAR COAST SHELF S,Estuar.

198,Climate change forecasting in a mountainous data scarce watershed using CMIP5 models under representative concentration pathways,"Hydrology cycle of river basins and available water resources in arid and semi-arid regions are highly affected by climate changes. In recent years, the increment of temperature due to excessive increased emission of greenhouse gases has led to an abnormality in the climate system of the earth. The main objective of this study is to survey the future climate changes in one of the biggest mountainous watersheds in northeast of Iran (i.e., Kashafrood). In this research, by considering the precipitation and temperature as two important climatic parameters in watersheds, 14 models evolved in the general circulation models (GCMs) of the newest generation in the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project Phase 5 (CMIP5) were used to forecast the future climate changes in the study area. For the historical period of 1992-2005, four evaluation criteria including Nash-Sutcliffe (NS), percent of bias (PBIAS), coefficient of determination (R (2)) and the ratio of the root-mean-square-error to the standard deviation of measured data (RSR) were used to compare the simulated observed data for assessing goodness-of-fit of the models. In the primary results, four climate models namely GFDL-ESM2G, IPSL-CM5A-MR, MIROC-ESM, and NorESM1-M were selected among the abovementioned 14 models due to their more prediction accuracies to the investigated evaluation criteria. Thereafter, climate changes of the future periods (near-century, 2006-2037; mid-century, 2037-2070; and late-century, 2070-2100) were investigated and compared by four representative concentration pathways (RCPs) of new emission scenarios of RCP2.6, RCP4.5, RCP6.0, and RCP8.5. In order to assess the trend of annual and seasonal changes of climatic components, Mann-Kendall non-parametric test (MK) was also employed. The results of Mann-Kendall test revealed that the precipitation has significant variable trends of both positive and negative alterations. Furthermore, the mean, maximum, and minimum temperature values had significant positive trends at 90, 99, and 99.9 % confidence level. On the other hand, in all parts of the Kashafrood Watershed (KW), the average temperature of watershed will be increased up to 0.56-3.3 A degrees C and the mean precipitation will be decreased up to 10.7 % by the end of the twenty-first century comparing to the historical baselines. Also, in seasonal scale, the maximum and minimum precipitations will occur in spring and summer, respectively, and the mean temperature is higher than the historical baseline in all seasons. The maximum and minimum values of the mean temperature will occur in summer and winter, respectively, and the amount of seasonal precipitation in these seasons will be reduced.",https://doi.org/10.1007/s00704-016-1908-5,10.1007/s00704-016-1908-5,"Afshar, A.

199,GRACE Satellites Enable Long-Lead Forecasts of Mountain Contributions to Streamflow in the Low-Flow Season,"Terrestrial water storage (TWS) in high mountain areas contributes large runoff volumes to nearby lowlands during the low-flow season when streamflow is critical to downstream water supplies. The potential for TWS from GRACE (Gravity Recovery and Climate Experiment) satellites to provide long-lead streamflow forecasting in adjacent lowlands during the low-flow season was assessed using the upper Yellow River as a case study. Two linear models were trained for forecasting monthly streamflow with and without TWS anomaly (TWSA) from 2002 to 2016. Results show that the model based on streamflow and TWSA is superior to the model based on streamflow alone at up to a five-month lead-time. The inclusion of TWSA reduced errors in streamflow forecasts by 25% to 50%, with 3-5-month lead-times, which represents the role of terrestrial hydrologic memory in streamflow changes during the low-flow season. This study underscores the high potential of streamflow forecasting using GRACE data with long lead-times that should improve water management in mountainous water towers and downstream areas.",https://doi.org/10.3390/rs13101993,10.3390/rs13101993,"Liu, Xingcai; Tang, Qiuhong; Hosseini-Moghari, Seyed-Mohammad; Shi, Xiaogang; Lo, Min-Hui; Scanlon, Bridget",REMOTE SENSING,streamflow forecast; terrestrial water storage; GRACE; low-flow season; water tower,SOIL-MOISTURE MEMORY; YELLOW-RIVER BASIN; CLIMATE-CHANGE; VARIABILITY; IMPACTS; REGIME,,MDPI,BASEL,"ST ALBAN-ANLAGE 66, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND",,2072-4292,,REMOTE SENS-BASEL,Remote Sens.,MAY,2021,13,10,,,1993,
200,"Deep learning hybrid model with Boruta-Random forest optimiser algorithm for streamflow forecasting with climate mode indices, rainfall, and periodicity","Long-term forecasting of any hydrologic phenomena is essential for strategic environmental planning, hydrologic and other forms of structural design, agriculture, and water resources management. Climate mode indices, utilising machine learning methods, are frequently considered as predictor variables in order to forecast several different hydrological variables. In this study, a feature selection algorithm based on two different deep learning models, i.e., long short-term memory and a gated recurrent unit, is applied to improve the forecasting capability of streamflow water levels at six gauging stations in the Murray Darling Basin of Australia. This paper therefore aggregates the significant antecedent lag memory of climate mode indices, rainfall, and the monthly factor based on the periodicity as the predictor variables to attain significantly accurate stream water level forecasts. This novel method identifies an improved relationship between the stream water level and climate mode indices through the aggregation of the significant lagged datasets capturing the historical features to predict the future streamflow water level. The boruta feature selection algorithm (BRF) was then applied in a two phase process before and after attaining the significant lagged inputs to screen the optimum predictor variables. The merits of the forecast models were evaluated through different performance evaluation criteria. The results show that the accumulated significant lagged inputs based on climate mode indices, along with the rainfall and periodicity factors are seen to provide improved forecasting of the SWL over the non-BRF deep learning approaches where no prior feature selection was applied. The hybrid LSTM method (i.e., BRF-LSTM model) achieved a unique advantage in terms of SWL forecasting, particularly attaining over 98% of the predictive errors lying within a band of +/-0.015 m with relatively low relative errors (RRMSE approximate to 1.30% and RMAE approximate to 0.882%), outperforming all of the benchmark models. It is also found that the periodicity factor has a potential influence on the accuracy of the forecast models for the four monitored study stations. This study concludes that the newly developed hybrid deep learning approaches, coupled with the BRF feature selection, provide improved forecasting performance. The hybrid approach developed in this paper can therefore be used to provide a strong provide predictive response algorithm for the hydrological variables that were influenced by the low-frequency variability of the climate model indices in respect to streamflow water level.",https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jhydrol.2021.126350,10.1016/j.jhydrol.2021.126350,"Ahmed, A.

201,"Small Hydropower Spot Prediction using SWAT and a Diversion Algorithm, Case Study: Upper Citarum Basin","Small-Scale Hydropower (SHP) had been important electric energy power source in Indonesia. Indonesia is vast countries, consists of more than 17.000 islands. It has large fresh water resource about 3 m of rainfall and 2 m of runoff. Much of its topography is mountainous, remote but abundant with potential energy. Millions of people do not have sufficient access to electricity, some live in the remote places. Recently, SHP development was encouraged for energy supply of the places. Development of global hydrology data provides opportunity to predict distribution of hydropower potential. In this paper, we demonstrate run-of-river type SHP spot prediction tool using SWAT and a river diversion algorithm. The use of Soil and Water Assessment Tool (SWAT) with input of CFSR (Climate Forecast System Re-analysis) of 10 years period had been implemented to predict spatially distributed flow cumulative distribution function (CDF). A simple algorithm to maximize potential head of a location by a river diversion expressing head race and penstock had been applied. Firm flow and power of the SHP were estimated from the CDF and the algorithm. The tool applied to Upper Citarum River Basin and three out of four existing hydropower locations had been well predicted. The result implies that this tool is able to support acceleration of SHP development at earlier phase.",https://doi.org/10.1063/1.5011625,10.1063/1.5011625,"Kardhana, Hadi; Arya, Doni Khaira; Hadihardaja, Iwan K.; Widyaningtyas; Riawan, Edi; Lubis, Atika",3RD INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE ON CONSTRUCTION AND BUILDING ENGINEERING (ICONBUILD 2017),,,,AMER INST PHYSICS,MELVILLE,"2 HUNTINGTON QUADRANGLE, STE 1NO1, MELVILLE, NY 11747-4501 USA",0094-243X,,978-0-7354-1591-1,AIP CONF PROC,,,2017,1903,,,,100015,
202,Impacts of Future Climate Projections on the Water Balance of the Gediz Basin in Turkey,"Located along the western coast of Turkey, the Gediz Basin counts on agriculture as its most important economic activity. Over the last few decades, the basin has been facing water-related problems, such as water scarcity and competing use of water. However, an investigation of possible future water demands and droughts is expected to be helpful for water managers dealing with the future water planning and management of the region. As such, this study aims at evaluating the future water balances occurring in the major reservoir of the basin during the 21s t century. For this purpose, four future water supply projections are generated using a hydroclimate modeling framework. This framework includes the coupling of a regional climate model, the weather research and forecasting (WRF) model, and a fully physically-based hydrologic model, the watershed environmental hydrology (WEHY) model, under two IPCC representative concentration pathway scenarios (RCP4.5 and RCP8.5) of a CMIP5 global climate model, HadGEM2-ES. A dynamic water balance model is, then, developed to carry out reservoir simulations and is used to operate the reservoir with the projected future flowrates in order to identify water deficits or surpluses under the projected irrigation water demands for the years between 2015 and 2100.",https://doi.org/,,"Gorguner, Merve; Kavvas, M.

The model presented acceptable values in calibration and validation and subsequently, scenarios from 0 to 100% of land use change were simulated.

204,Sensitivity of streamflow simulation in the Delaware River Basin to forecasted land-cover change for 2030 and 2060,"In order to simulate the potential effect of forecasted land-cover change on streamflow and water availability, there has to be confidence that the hydrologic model used is sensitive to small changes in land cover (<10%) and that this land-cover change exceeds the inherent uncertainty in forecasted conditions. To investigate this, a 26-year streamflow record was simulated for 33 basins (54-928 km(2)) in the Delaware River Basin using three dates of land cover: the 2011 National Land-Cover Dataset (Homer, Fry, & Barnes, ), 2030 land-cover conditions representing median values from 101 equally-likely forecasts, and 2060 land-cover conditions corresponding to the same iterations used to represent 2030. Streamflow was simulated using a process-based hydrologic model that includes both pervious and impervious methods as parameterized by three land-cover-based hydrologic response units (HRUs)-forested, agricultural, and developed land. Small, but significant differences in streamflow magnitude, variability, and seasonality were seen among the three time periods-2011, 2030, and 2060. Temporal differences were discernible from the range of conditions simulated with 101 equally likely forecasts for 2030. Development was co-located with the most frequent landscape components, as characterized by topographic wetness index, resulting in a change in hydrology for each HRU, highlighting that knowing the location of disturbance is key to understanding potential streamflow changes. These results show that streamflow simulation using regional calibration that incorporates land-cover-based HRUs can be sensitive to relatively small changes in land-cover and that temporal trends resulting from land-cover change can be isolated in order to evaluate other changes that might affect water resources.",https://doi.org/10.1002/hyp.13315,10.1002/hyp.13315,"Williamson, Tanja N.; Claggett, Peter",HYDROLOGICAL PROCESSES,environmental impacts; surface-water hydrology; water-resource management,CLIMATE; TRENDS; MODEL,,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0885-6087,1099-1085,,HYDROL PROCESS,Hydrol.

205,Water quality prediction of salton sea using machine learning and big data techniques,"Water accounts for about 70% of the earth's surface and is one of the most important sources of life. The degradation of the Salton Sea's water quality due to excessive usage of fertilisers and pesticides in agriculture has posed serious risks to biodiversity, human health, and the local economy. As a result, it is necessary to establish effective and reliable methodologies for assessing water quality and predicting future trends. This work investigates regression and machine learning models such as linear regression, random forest, support vector machine (SVM) and long short-term memory (LSTM) to predict the salinity level of Salton Sea and forecast future trend. The proposed work studies the Salton Sea water quality and predict certain chemical or physical characteristics such as salinity, pH, and dissolved oxygen. It also finds the correlation between water indexes and environmental indexes surrounding the Salton Sea. The findings of this study can assist policymakers in determining the salinity of water and devising policies to minimise salt levels in order to manage freshwater for long-term development. While evaluating experiments, it has been found that the machine learning methodology is more flexible and accurate than traditional statistical methods, and that it aids in achieving better results.",https://doi.org/10.1080/03067319.2021.1963713,10.1080/03067319.2021.1963713,"Chawla, Priyanka; Cao, Xiyu; Fu, Yichen; Hu, Ching-min; Wang, Meng; Wang, Shenquan; Gao, Jerry Zeyu",INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL ANALYTICAL CHEMISTRY,Machine learning; water quality; SVM; LSTM,,,TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD,ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OR14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0306-7319,1029-0397,,INT J ENVIRON AN CH,Int.

207,Use of bias correction techniques to improve seasonal forecasts for reservoirs - A case-study in north western Mediterranean,"In this paper, we have compared different bias correction methodologies to assess whether they could be advantageous for improving the performance of a seasonal prediction model for volume anomalies in the Boadella reservoir (northwestern Mediterranean). The bias correction adjustments have been applied on precipitation and temperature from the European Centre for Middle-range Weather Forecasting System 4 (S4). We have used three bias correction strategies: two linear (mean bias correction, BC, and linear regression, LR) and one non-linear (Model Output Statistics analogs, MOS-analog). The results have been compared with climatology and persistence. The volume-anomaly model is a previously computed Multiple Linear Regression that ingests precipitation, temperature and in-flow anomaly data to simulate monthly volume anomalies. The potential utility for end-users has been assessed using economic value curve areas. We have studied the S4 hindcast period 1981-2010 for each month of the year and up to seven months ahead considering an ensemble of 15 members. We have shown that the MOS-analog and LR bias corrections can improve the original S4. The application to volume anomalies points towards the possibility to introduce bias correction methods as a tool to improve water resource seasonal forecasts in an end-user context of climate services. Particularly, the MOS-analog approach gives generally better results than the other approaches in late autumn and early winter. (c) 2017 Elsevier B.V.

208,Leveraging multi-model season-ahead streamflow forecasts to trigger advanced flood preparedness in Peru,"Disaster planning has historically allocated minimal effort and finances toward advanced preparedness; however, evidence supports reduced vulnerability to flood events, saving lives and money, through appropriate early actions. Among other requirements, effective early action systems necessitate the availability of high-quality forecasts to inform decision making. In this study, we evaluate the ability of statistical and physically based season-ahead prediction models to appropriately trigger flood early preparedness actions based on a 75% or greater probability of surpassing the 80th percentile of historical seasonal streamflow for the floodprone Maranon River and Piura River in Peru. The statistical prediction model, developed in this work, leverages the asymmetric relationship between seasonal streamflow and the ENSO phenomenon. Additionally, a multi-model (least-squares combination) is also evaluated against current operational practices. The statistical prediction demonstrates superior performance compared to the physically based model for the Maranon River by correctly triggering preparedness actions in three out of four historical occasions, while both the statistical and multi-model predictions capture all four historical events when the required threshold excee-dance probability is reduced to 50 %, with only one false alarm. For the Piura River, the statistical model proves superior to all other approaches, correctly triggering 28% more often in the hindcast period. Continued efforts should focus on applying this season-ahead prediction framework to additional flood-prone locations where early actions may be warranted and current forecast capacity is limited.",https://doi.org/10.5194/nhess-21-2215-2021,10.5194/nhess-21-2215-2021,"Keating, Colin; Lee, Donghoon; Bazo, Juan; Block, Paul",NATURAL HAZARDS AND EARTH SYSTEM SCIENCES,,EL-NINO; CLIMATE FORECASTS; PREDICTION; RAINFALL; IMPROVEMENTS; PATTERNS,,COPERNICUS GESELLSCHAFT MBH,GOTTINGEN,"BAHNHOFSALLEE 1E, GOTTINGEN, 37081, GERMANY",1561-8633,1684-9981,,NAT HAZARD EARTH SYS,Nat.

209,Improving efficiencies of flood forecasting during lead times: an operational method and its application in the Baiyunshan Reservoir,"Accurate and reliable flood forecasting plays an important role in flood control, reservoir operation, and water resources management. Conventional hydrological parameter calibration is based on an objective function without consideration for forecast performance during lead-time periods. A novel objective function, i.e., minimizing the sum of the squared errors between forecasted and observed streamflow during multiple lead times, is proposed to calibrate hydrological parameters for improved forecasting. China's Baiyunshan Reservoir basin was selected as a case study, and the Xinanjiang model was used. The proposed method provided better results for peak flows, in terms of the value and occurrence time, than the conventional method. Specifically, the qualified rate of peak flow for 4-, 5-, and 6-h lead times in the proposed method were 69.2%, 53.8%, and 38.5% in calibration, and 60%, 40%, and 20% in validation, respectively. This compares favorably with the corresponding values for the conventional method, which were 53.8%, 15.4%, and 7.7% in calibration, and 20%, 20%, and 0% in validation, respectively. Uncertainty analysis revealed that the proposed method caused less parameter uncertainty than the conventional method. Therefore, the proposed method is effective in improving the performance during multiple lead times for flood mitigation.",https://doi.org/10.2166/nh.2018.051,10.2166/nh.2018.051,"Liu, Pan; Zhang, Xiaojing; Zhao, Yan; Deng, Chao; Li, Zejun; Xiong, Mengsi",HYDROLOGY RESEARCH,flood forecasting; lead time; objective function; Xinanjiang model,RAINFALL-RUNOFF MODEL; PARAMETER UNCERTAINTY ANALYSIS; LIKELIHOOD FUNCTIONS; XINANJIANG MODEL; CALIBRATION; PERFORMANCE; INFLOW; PRECIPITATION; SIMULATION; RULES,,IWA PUBLISHING,LONDON,"ALLIANCE HOUSE, 12 CAXTON ST, LONDON SW1H0QS, ENGLAND",0029-1277,2224-7955,,HYDROL RES,Hydrol.

210,"A Comparative Analysis of Hidden Markov Model, Hybrid Support Vector Machines, and Hybrid Artificial Neural Fuzzy Inference System in Reservoir Inflow Forecasting (Case Study: The King Fand Dam, Saudi Arabia)","The precise prediction of the streamflow of reservoirs is of considerable importance for many activities relating to water resource management, such as reservoir operation and flood and drought control and protection. This study aimed to develop and evaluate the applicability of a hidden Markov model (HMM) and two hybrid models, i.e., the support vector machine-genetic algorithm (SVM-GA) and artificial neural fuzzy inference system-genetic algorithm (ANFIS-GA), for reservoir inflow forecasting at the King Fand dam, Saudi Arabia. The results obtained by the HMM model were compared with those for the two hybrid models ANFIS-GA and SVM-GA, and with those for individual SVM and ANFIS models based on performance evaluation indicators and visual inspection. The results of the comparison revealed that the ANFIS-GA model and ANFIS model provided superior results for forecasting monthly inflow with satisfactory accuracy in both training (R-2 = 0.924, 0.857) and testing (R-2 = 0.842, 0.810) models. The performance evaluation results for the developed models showed that the GA-induced improvement in the ANFIS and SVR forecasts was matched by an approximately 25% decrease in RMSE and around a 13% increase in Nash-Sutcliffe efficiency. The promising accuracy of the proposed models demonstrates their potential for applications in monthly inflow forecasting in the present semiarid region.",https://doi.org/10.3390/w13091236,10.3390/w13091236,"Alquraish, Mohammed M.; Abuhasel, Khaled A.; Alqahtani, Abdulrahman S.; Khadr, Mosaad",WATER,reservoir inflow forecasting; artificial neural fuzzy inference system; support vector machine; genetic algorithm,FLOOD-CONTROL; RIVER-BASIN; STREAMFLOW; OPERATION; ANFIS; ARIMA; PREDICTION; DISCHARGE; NETWORKS; DROUGHT,,MDPI,BASEL,"ST ALBAN-ANLAGE 66, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND",,2073-4441,,WATER-SUI,Water,MAY,2021,13,9,,,1236,
211,Advances in forecasting harmful algal blooms using machine learning models: A case study with Planktothrix rubescens in Lake Geneva,"The development of anthropic activities during the 20th century increased the nutrient fluxes in freshwater ecosystems, leading to the eutrophication phenomenon that most often promotes harmful algal blooms (HABs). Recent years have witnessed the regular and massive development of some filamentous algae or cyanobacteria in Lake Geneva. Consequently, important blooms could result in detrimental impacts on economic issues and human health. In this study, we tried to lay the foundation of an HAB forecast model to help scientists and local stakeholders with the present and future management of this peri-alpine lake. Our forecast strategy was based on pairing two machine learning models with a long-term database built over the past 34 years. We created HAB groups via a K-means model. Then, we introduced different lag times in the input of a random forest (RF) model, using a sliding window. Finally, we used a high-frequency dataset to compare the natural mechanisms with numerical interaction using individual conditional expectation plots. We demonstrate that some HAB events can be forecasted over a year scale. The information contained in the concentration data of the cyanobacteria was synthesized in the form of four intensity groups that directly depend on the P. rubescens concentration. The categorical transformation of these data allowed us to obtain a forecast with correlation coefficients that stayed above a threshold of 0.5 until one year for the counting cells and two years for the biovolume data. Moreover, we found that the RF model predicted the best P. rubescens abundance for water temperatures around 14 degrees C. This result is consistent with the biological processes of the toxic cyano-bacterium. In this study, we found that the coupling between K-means and RF models could help in forecasting the development of the bloom-forming P. rubescens in Lake Geneva. This methodology could create a numerical decision support tool, which should be a significant advantage for lake managers.",https://doi.org/10.1016/j.hal.2020.101906,10.1016/j.hal.2020.101906,"Derot, Jonathan; Yajima, Hiroshi; Jacquet, Stephan",HARMFUL ALGAE,Water quality management; Planktothrix rubescens; Peri-alpine lakes; Forecast; Random forest; Individual conditional expectation plots,CHLOROPHYLL-A; FRESH-WATER; CYANOBACTERIAL TOXINS; MANAGEMENT; HEALTH; FISH; PERFORMANCE; QUALITY; IMPACT; GROWTH,,ELSEVIER,AMSTERDAM,"RADARWEG 29, 1043 NX AMSTERDAM, NETHERLANDS",1568-9883,1878-1470,,HARMFUL ALGAE,Harmful Algae,NOV,2020,99,,,,101906,
212,Long-term streamflow forecasting for the Cascade Reservoir System of Han River using SWAT with CFS output,"Due to the large uncertainties of long-term precipitation prediction and reservoir operation, it is difficult to forecast long-term streamflow for large basins with cascade reservoirs. In this paper, a framework coupling the original Climate Forecasting System (CFS) precipitation with the Soil and Water Assessment Tool (SWAT) was proposed to forecast the nine-month streamflow for the Cascade Reservoir System of Han River (CRSHR) including Shiquan, Ankang and Danjiangkou reservoirs. First, CFS precipitation was tested against the observation and post-processed through two machine learning algorithms, random forest and support vector regression. Results showed the correlation coefficients between the monthly areal CFS precipitation (post-processed) and observation were 0.91-0.96, confirming that CFS precipitation post-processing using machine learning was not affected by the extended forecast period. Additionally, two precipitation spatio-temporal distribution models, original CFS and similar historical observation, were adopted to disaggregate the processed monthly areal CFS precipitation to daily subbasin-scale precipitation. Based on the reservoir restoring flow, the regional SWAT was calibrated for CRSHR. The Nash-Sutcliffe efficiencies for three reservoirs flow simulation were 0.86, 0.88 and 0.84, respectively, meeting the accuracy requirement. The experimental forecast showed that for three reservoirs, long-term streamflow forecast with similar historical observed distribution was more accurate than that with original CFS.",https://doi.org/10.2166/nh.2018.114,10.2166/nh.2018.114,"Liu, Tian; Chen, Yuanfang; Li, Binquan; Hu, Yiming; Qiu, Hui; Liang, Zhongmin",HYDROLOGY RESEARCH,Cascade Reservoir System of Han River; CFS post-processing; long-term monthly streamflow forecasting; machine learning algorithms; SWAT,,,IWA PUBLISHING,LONDON,"ALLIANCE HOUSE, 12 CAXTON ST, LONDON SW1H0QS, ENGLAND",0029-1277,2224-7955,,HYDROL RES,Hydrol.

213,ASSESSING THE CLIMATE FORECAST SYSTEM REANALYSIS WEATHER DATA DRIVEN HYDROLOGICAL MODEL FOR THE YANGTZE RIVER BASIN IN CHINA,"It is a challenge to adequately represent meteorological data for river basin modelling in data scarce regions. Hydrological models may benefit from alternative climate data sources such as the Climate Forecast System Reanalysis (CFSR) weather data. A proposed method was applied to evaluate the applicability of CFSR data in the Soil and Water Assessment Tool (SWAT) eco-hydrological model for the 1.8 x 10(6) km(2) Yangtze River Basin (YRB) in China The CFSR data were first validated by ground-based meteorological station (GMS) data to confirm sufficient accuracy to predict the hydrology for the YRB. It was determined that the CFSR simulation was able to generate acceptable accuracy with calibrated parameters of GMS-based model. The R-2 and ENS of the monthly results from both GMS- and CFSR-SWAT simulations were > 0.70 in both calibration and validation periods. The monthly streamflow hydrograph from GMS and CFSR simulations showed two different patterns: distinct differences in baseflow and less discrepancy for the peak flows, such as the patterns at Cuntan and Yichang gauge stations, whereas the results are characterized as close matches the peaks and the recession periods at Hankou and Datong gauge stations. The CFSR simulation generated better results in the middle and lower reaches than in the upper reach of the basin. To a certain extent, the CFSR provides an alternative to quickly build hydrological model in data scarce area for large basins.",https://doi.org/10.15666/aeer/1702_36153632,10.15666/aeer/1702_36153632,"Lu, J.

214,Streamflow forecasting by modeling the rainfall-streamflow relationship using artificial neural networks,"Streamflow forecasting is a complex and fundamental hydrological phenomenon. The accurate prediction of the streamflow helps in the planning, design, and management of water resources in particular irrigation, hydropower production, flood risk management, and protection for dams. Unexpected and heavy rainfall results in river overflowing which is the leading cause of serious flooding. In this research work, we proposed an effective approach for streamflow forecasting by modeling the rainfall-streamflow relationship. The key objective of this research work is to identify the appropriate set of rainfall patterns to predict the daily river streamflow. This research work is divided into two successive phases. In the first phase of this research, we have identified the different sets of antecedent rainfall combinations. In the second phase, the artificial neural network (ANN) models are developed and trained using each of these different rainfall patterns to forecast daily river streamflow. Finally, the performance of the developed ANN models is evaluated using four different performance metrics including root-mean-squared error (RMSE), correlation coefficient (R), the coefficient of determination (R-2), and Nash-Sutcliffe efficiency coefficient. The results of the research work indicate that the ANN model developed by presenting rainfall patterns of the previous 4 days can precisely predict the daily streamflow with 0.97 and 0.94 value of R-2 for the validation and test period, respectively. The results of the research work also revealed that the architecture of the ANN model and combination of input patterns presented to the model significantly affects the training time, learning ability, and performance of the ANN model. Furthermore, these encouraging results proved that the proposed ANN-based approach can be a useful and effective alternative method for solving hydrological problems.",https://doi.org/10.1007/s40808-020-00780-3,10.1007/s40808-020-00780-3,"Ali, Shahzad; Shahbaz, Muhammad",MODELING EARTH SYSTEMS AND ENVIRONMENT,Artificial neural network; Backpropagation; Forecasting; Pakistan; Prediction; Rainfall; Streamflow,RUNOFF,,SPRINGER HEIDELBERG,HEIDELBERG,"TIERGARTENSTRASSE 17, D-69121 HEIDELBERG, GERMANY",2363-6203,2363-6211,,MODEL EARTH SYST ENV,Model.

215,Optimizing multiple reliable forward contracts for reservoir allocation using multitime scale streamflow forecasts,"Streamflow forecasts at multiple time scales provide a new opportunity for reservoir management to address competing objectives. Market instruments such as forward contracts with specified reliability are considered as a tool that may help address the perceived risk associated with the use of such forecasts in lieu of traditional operation and allocation strategies. A water allocation process that enables multiple contracts for water supply and hydropower production with different durations, while maintaining a prescribed level of flood risk reduction, is presented. The allocation process is supported by an optimization model that considers multitime scale ensemble forecasts of monthly streamflow and flood volume over the upcoming season and year, the desired reliability and pricing of proposed contracts for hydropower and water supply. It solves for the size of contracts at each reliability level that can be allocated for each future period, while meeting target end of period reservoir storage with a prescribed reliability. The contracts may be insurable, given that their reliability is verified through retrospective modeling. The process can allow reservoir operators to overcome their concerns as to the appropriate skill of probabilistic forecasts, while providing water users with short-term and long-term guarantees as to how much water or energy they may be allocated. An application of the optimization model to the Bhakra Dam, India, provides an illustration of the process. The issues of forecast skill and contract performance are examined. A field engagement of the idea is useful to develop a real-world perspective and needs a suitable institutional environment.",https://doi.org/10.1002/2016WR019552,10.1002/2016WR019552,"Lu, Mengqian; Lall, Upmanu; Robertson, Andrew W.; Cook, Edward",WATER RESOURCES RESEARCH,market-based reliable and insurable contracts; climate-informed water management; hierarchical multitime scales ensemble forecasts; prescribed reliability for supplies; dynamic flood control storage allocation; nonlinear global optimization,CLIMATE-CHANGE; GCM SIMULATIONS; SEASONAL INFLOW; EL-NINO; RIVER; FLOODS; PREDICTABILITY; CALIFORNIA; FREQUENCY; FRAMEWORK,,AMER GEOPHYSICAL UNION,WASHINGTON,"2000 FLORIDA AVE NW, WASHINGTON, DC 20009 USA",0043-1397,1944-7973,,WATER RESOUR RES,Water Resour.

216,Flood forecasting scheme of Nanshui reservoir based on Liuxihe model,"China experiences one of the most frequent flood disasters in the world. Establishing accurate and reliable flood prediction program is the key to deal with flood disasters. Nanshui Reservoir Basin, in southern China, belongs to subtropical monsoon climate, with more rain in spring, concentrated rainstorm in summer and typhoon storm in autumn. Floods at dam site are mostly small and medium-sized floods with steep rise and slow fall as typical mountain flood. In order to explore the applicability of Liuxihe model in flood prediction of Nanshui Reservoir, this paper builds up Liuxihe model for Nanshui Reservoir based on DEM, land use and soil type data, and selects a typical flood event to optimize the parameters using particle swarm optimization (PSO) algorithm and verifies the accuracy of the model by simulating the other floods. Liuxihe model established in this paper indicates a satisfactory performance for flood prediction for Nanshui Reservoir, which can meet the accuracy requirement of flood prediction. Finally, the effects of different river grading and PSO algorithm on flood prediction are discussed. The results show that the PSO algorithm can obviously improve the accuracy of the Liuxihe model for flood forecast in Nanshui Reservoir. The simulation based on four-level channel grading has better results than that based on three-level channel, which indicates increased peak flood value, delayed peak time and closer simulation to the measured value.

217,Complexity to Forecast Flood: Problem Definition and Spatiotemporal Attention LSTM Solution,"With significant development of sensors and Internet of things, researchers nowadays can easily know what happens in physical space by acquiring time-varying values of various factors. Essentially, growing data category and size greatly contribute to solve problems happened in physical space. In this paper, we aim to solve a complex problem that affects both cities and villages, i.e., flood. To reduce impacts induced by floods, hydrological factors acquired from physical space and data-driven models in cyber space have been adopted to accurately forecast floods. Considering the significance of modeling attention capability among hydrology factors, we believe extraction of discriminative hydrology factors not only reflect natural rules in physical space, but also optimally model iterations of factors to forecast run-off values in cyber space. Therefore, we propose a novel data-driven model named as STA-LSTM by integrating Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) structure and spatiotemporal attention module, which is capable of forecasting floods for small- and medium-sized rivers. The proposed spatiotemporal attention module firstly explores spatial relationship between input hydrological factors from different locations and run-off outputs, which assigns time-varying weights to various factors. Afterwards, the proposed attention module allocates temporal-dependent weights to hidden output of each LSTM cell, which describes significance of state output for final forecasting results. Taking Lech and Changhua river basins as cases of physical space, several groups of comparative experiments show that STA-LSTM is capable to optimize complexity of mathematically modeling floods in cyber space.",https://doi.org/10.1155/2020/7670382,10.1155/2020/7670382,"Wu, Yirui; Ding, Yukai; Zhu, Yuelong; Feng, Jun; Wang, Sifeng",COMPLEXITY,,COMPUTATION OFFLOADING METHOD; SERVICE RECOMMENDATION; PRIVACY PRESERVATION; NETWORKS,,WILEY-HINDAWI,LONDON,"ADAM HOUSE, 3RD FL, 1 FITZROY SQ, LONDON, WIT 5HE, ENGLAND",1076-2787,1099-0526,,COMPLEXITY,Complexity,MAR 26,2020,2020,,,,7670382,
218,Does scale matter? A systematic review of incorporating biological realism when predicting changes in species distributions,"Background There is ample evidence that biotic factors, such as biotic interactions and dispersal capacity, can affect species distributions and influence species' responses to climate change. However, little is known about how these factors affect predictions from species distribution models (SDMs) with respect to spatial grain and extent of the models. Objectives Understanding how spatial scale influences the effects of biological processes in SDMs is important because SDMs are one of the primary tools used by conservation biologists to assess biodiversity impacts of climate change. Data sources and study eligibility criteria We systematically reviewed SDM studies published from 2003-2015 using ISI Web of Science searches to: (1) determine the current state and key knowledge gaps of SDMs that incorporate biotic interactions and dispersal; and (2) understand how choice of spatial scale may alter the influence of biological processes on SDM predictions. Synthesis methods and limitations We used linear mixed effects models to examine how predictions from SDMs changed in response to the effects of spatial scale, dispersal, and biotic interactions. Results There were important biases in studies including an emphasis on terrestrial ecosystems in northern latitudes and little representation of aquatic ecosystems. Our results suggest that neither spatial extent nor grain influence projected climate-induced changes in species ranges when SDMs include dispersal or biotic interactions. Conclusions We identified several knowledge gaps and suggest that SDM studies forecasting the effects of climate change should: 1) address broader ranges of taxa and locations; and 1) report the grain size, extent, and results with and without biological complexity. The spatial scale of analysis in SDMs did not affect estimates of projected range shifts with dispersal and biotic interactions. However, the lack of reporting on results with and without biological complexity precluded many studies from our analysis.",https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0194650,10.1371/journal.pone.0194650,"Record, Sydne; Strecker, Angela; Tuanmu, Mao-Ning; Beaudrot, Lydia; Zarnetske, Phoebe; Belmaker, Jonathan; Gerstner, Beth",PLOS ONE,,DISTRIBUTION MODELS; CLIMATE-CHANGE; GRAIN-SIZE; BIOTIC INTERACTIONS; DISPERSAL DISTANCE; PLANT-DISTRIBUTION; SENSITIVITY; MAMMALS; ACCOUNT; FUTURE,,PUBLIC LIBRARY SCIENCE,SAN FRANCISCO,"1160 BATTERY STREET, STE 100, SAN FRANCISCO, CA 94111 USA",1932-6203,,,PLOS ONE,PLoS One,APR 13,2018,13,4,,,e0194650,
219,Skilful seasonal forecasts of streamflow over Europe?,"This paper considers whether there is any added value in using seasonal climate forecasts instead of historical meteorological observations for forecasting streamflow on seasonal timescales over Europe. A Europe-wide analysis of the skill of the newly operational EFAS (European Flood Awareness System) seasonal streamflow forecasts (produced by forcing the Lisflood model with the ECMWF System 4 seasonal climate forecasts), benchmarked against the ensemble streamflow prediction (ESP) forecasting approach (produced by forcing the Lisflood model with historical meteorological observations), is undertaken. The results suggest that, on average, the System 4 seasonal climate forecasts improve the streamflow predictability over historical meteorological observations for the first month of lead time only (in terms of hindcast accuracy, sharpness and overall performance). However, the predictability varies in space and time and is greater in winter and autumn. Parts of Europe additionally exhibit a longer predictability, up to 7 months of lead time, for certain months within a season. In terms of hindcast reliability, the EFAS seasonal streamflow hindcasts are on average less skilful than the ESP for all lead times. The results also highlight the potential usefulness of the EFAS seasonal streamflow forecasts for decision-making (measured in terms of the hindcast discrimination for the lower and upper terciles of the simulated streamflow). Although the ESP is the most potentially useful forecasting approach in Europe, the EFAS seasonal streamflow forecasts appear more potentially useful than the ESP in some regions and for certain seasons, especially in winter for almost 40 % of Europe. Patterns in the EFAS seasonal streamflow hindcast skill are however not mirrored in the System 4 seasonal climate hindcasts, hinting at the need for a better understanding of the link between hydrological and meteorological variables on seasonal timescales, with the aim of improving climate-model-based seasonal streamflow forecasting.",https://doi.org/10.5194/hess-22-2057-2018,10.5194/hess-22-2057-2018,"Arnal, Louise; Cloke, Hannah L.; Stephens, Elisabeth; Wetterhall, Fredrik; Prudhomme, Christel; Neumann, Jessica; Krzeminski, Blazej; Pappenberger, Florian",HYDROLOGY AND EARTH SYSTEM SCIENCES,,PROBABILISTIC FORECASTS; CLIMATE FORECASTS; WATER-RESOURCES; UNITED-STATES; SYSTEM; RIVER; PREDICTABILITY; DROUGHT; MODEL; TIME,,COPERNICUS GESELLSCHAFT MBH,GOTTINGEN,"BAHNHOFSALLEE 1E, GOTTINGEN, 37081, GERMANY",1027-5606,1607-7938,,HYDROL EARTH SYST SC,Hydrol.

220,Evaluation and prediction of water quality in the dammed estuaries and rivers of Taihu Lake,"Proper evaluation of water quality is pertinent to estuarine habitat restoration. Identifying the degrading factors of the water environment and predicting the trend of eutrophication are key to restore the habitat. Through trophic level index (TLI), water quality index (WQI), modified Nemerow pollution index (NPI), and the Random Forest (RF) model, water samples collected from various estuaries of Taihu Lake from 2017 to 2019 were evaluated. To predict the water quality development, four scenarios were set viz. S1: add or remove an ecological buffer, S2: increase or reduce the external nutrients, S3: open or close the dam/gate, and S4: increase or decrease the internal release. In Wuli Lake, the nutrient concentrations in the river regions were higher than in the lake regions, while a contrary trend was observed in Gonghu Bay. The estuarine water quality in the dry season (WQI = 40.91, NPI = 1.73) was merely worse than that in the wet season (WQI = 47.27, NPI = 1.67). On the other hand, the eutrophic status in the wet season (TLIWet = 57.93) was worse than that in the dry season (TLIDry = 57.23). The estuarine water quality of Taihu Lake has improved from 2017 to 2019 but still belongs to medium level. The principal component analysis (PCA) revealed that dam construction, land use types, unstable hydrodynamic conditions, and trumpet-shaped estuary were the main factors that aggravated the water quality degradation. The RF model has strong forecasting capabilities for estuarine water quality. When the estuaries are close to residential and industrial districts, controlling the surface runoff and improving sewage treatment efficiency are the most effective measures to improve the water quality. In the estuaries, the sediments are usually disturbed by the wind-waves. Conclusively, reducing sediment disturbance and internal contamination accumulation via biological and engineering measures is the key to estuarine restoration.",https://doi.org/10.1007/s11356-020-12063-6,10.1007/s11356-020-12063-6,"Chen, Xi; Wang, Yanhua; Sun, Tian; Chen, Yan; Zhang, Maoheng; Ye, Chun",ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE AND POLLUTION RESEARCH,Taihu Lake; Estuary; Water quality evaluation; Prediction; Random forest,NONPOINT-SOURCE POLLUTION; EUTROPHICATION; IMPACT; INDEXES; SYSTEM; BASIN; STOICHIOMETRY; LIMITATION; SEDIMENT; NITROGEN,,SPRINGER HEIDELBERG,HEIDELBERG,"TIERGARTENSTRASSE 17, D-69121 HEIDELBERG, GERMANY",0944-1344,1614-7499,,ENVIRON SCI POLLUT R,Environ.

This study covered three of the most representative rivers of the Shu basin. It was based on the weather and gauging stations' observation data in the river Shu basin - the northern Tien Shan. Based on the trend analysis, an increase in the average annual temperature and river discharge was identified within the observation period as a whole, and for the separate compared periods. Furthermore, the mean annual flow projections were made based on the methodology of the retrospective analysis of runoff and the rate of river flow increase for the observation period, and further extrapolation of data for the forecast period. According to the analysis, the mean annual flow for the considered rivers will be decreased by 25 to 30% on average by 2050. These findings are necessary for elaborating adaptation measures in water allocation for freshwater supply, irrigation and hydropower within this transboundary river.</p>",https://doi.org/10.3390/w13202800,10.3390/w13202800,"Kaliyeva, Karlygash; Punys, Petras; Zhaparkulova, Yermekul",WATER,climate change; glacier-and snow-fed rivers; hydrological regime; forecast,RUNOFF,,MDPI,BASEL,"ST ALBAN-ANLAGE 66, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND",,2073-4441,,WATER-SUI,Water,OCT,2021,13,20,,,2800,
222,Hazardous chemical accident prediction for drinking water sources in Three Gorges Reservoir,"Water pollution accidents occur in drinking water sources may pollute water environment, destroy water ecological balance, and threaten the drinking water safety for residents. Based on water quality hydrodynamic mathematical equations and Digital Elevation Model, a new water pollution accident prediction program for drinking water sources in Three Gorges Reservoir under different hydrological conditions was developed. Moreover, this new program was firstly used to forecast and analyze flow field changes and concentration reduction of a hazardous chemical pollution accident in Huangjuedu drinking water source. By comparing the calculated values and the measured ones of February 10 to February 19, 2016, the maximum relative error was less than 10%, which indicated that the new program was feasible and reasonable. For pollution accident prediction in the drinking water source, the results showed that the maximum transverse velocity had stabilized as 2.070 m/s, 2.411 m/s and 2.717 m/s since 20 min after the accident responding to discharge flow of Xiangjiaba with 1800 m3/s, 2700 m3/s,and 3600 m3/s, respectively. The maximum vertical one was 1.372 m/s, 1.598 m/s and 1.872 m/s respectively since 20 min after accident under the corresponding conditions. Furthermore, the water quality of the drinking water source met the standard 23 min after the accident under the condition that the discharge flow of Xiangjiaba was 1800 m3/s. For conditions that discharge flows were 2700 m3/s and 3600 m3/s, the corresponding times to meet the standard were 21 min and 20 min after the accident, respectively. Thence, relatively large dispatch flows would help reduce the impacts of pollution accidents and accelerate water quality improvement of drinking water sources. This study provides a new and useful tool for predicting the diffusion and migration of pollutants in drinking water sources of Three Gorges Reservoir. And it also gives a practical reference for decision makers to forcast hazardous chemical pollution accidents in drinking water sources. (c) 2021 Elsevier Ltd.

Humid and semi-humid areas suffer from frequent flood events, whereas semi-arid areas suffer from flash floods because of urbanization and climate change, which contribute to an increase in runoff. This study applied -Support Vector Machine (epsilon-SVM) and artificial neural network (ANN) for the simulation and forecasting streamflow of three different catchments. The Evolutionary Strategy (ES) optimization method was used to optimize the ANN and SVM sensitive parameters.

224,Long lead-time daily and monthly streamflow forecasting using machine learning methods,"Long lead-time streamflow forecasting is of great significance for water resources planning and management in both the short and long terms. Despite of some studies using machine learning methods in streamflow forecasting, only few studies have been conducted to explore long lead-time forecasting capabilities of these methods, and gain an insight into systematic comparison of model forecasting performance in both the short and long terms. In this work, an artificial neural network (ANN) and a long short term memory (LSTM), a powerful tool for learning long-term temporal dependencies and capturing nonlinear relationship, have been adopted to forecast streamflow at daily and monthly scales for a long lead-time period. For long lead-time streamflow forecasting, a recursive forecasting procedure, which takes the last one-step-ahead forecast as a new input for the next-step-ahead forecast, is used in the ANN and LSTM forecasting systems. Two models are trained and validated for streamflow forecasting using the rainfall and runoff datasets collected from the Nan River Basin and Ping River Basin, Thailand, covering the period 1974 to 2014. To further explore the impact of parameter settings on model performance, two parameters, i.e. the length of time lag and the number of maximum epochs, are examined in the ANN and LSTM models. The main findings are highlighted here. First, with an optimal setting up of model parameters, both the ANN and LSTM model can provide accurate daily forecasting (up to 20 days ahead). Second, in comparison to the ANN model, the LSTM model exhibits better model performance in long lead-time daily forecasting, but less satisfactory in multi-monthly forecasting due to lack of large monthly training dataset. Third, the selection of the length of the time lag and number of maximum epochs used in both ANN and LSTM modelling are the key for long lead-time streamflow forecasting at daily and monthly scales. These findings suggest that the LSTM could be advance in daily streamflow forecasting and thus would be helpful to assist in strategy decisions in water resource management.",https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jhydrol.2020.125376,10.1016/j.jhydrol.2020.125376,"Cheng, M.; Fang, F.; Kinouchi, T.; Navon, I.

225,Examination and comparison of binary metaheuristic wrapper-based input variable selection for local and global climate information-driven one-step monthly streamflow forecasting,"The use of data-driven models to forecast streamflow has received substantial attention from scholars in recent years. However, systematic studies have not been performed to examine binary metaheuristic wrapper-based input variable selection (BMWIVS) in real-world streamflow forecasting. In this study, we explored binary metaheuristic-based shallow machine learning wrappers for one-step monthly streamflow forecasting using local weather information and global climate indices from three catchments with different hydroclimatic conditions. First, the maximal information coefficient (MIC) was employed to investigate the correlations among the forecasting target, streamflow and candidate input variables, which included both local and global climate information. Then, the BMWIVS models obtained by combining eight binary metaheuristic algorithms, five commonly used shallow machine learning algorithms, two combined filter-based input variable selection (FIVS) methods, and two forecasting methods were examined. Finally, the performance of each model was compared with the performance of typical benchmark models, including the univariate seasonal autoregressive integrated moving average model, five machine learning algorithms with no input variable selection, and five machine learning algorithms that use five different FIVS methods. The experimental results emphasized three significant findings. First, an appropriate input variable selection method should be selected in practice because several examined wrappers were inferior to the benchmark models. Second, the BMWIVS model that combined the regularized extreme learning machine method, binary gray wolf optimizer, FIVS results-based initialization method, and forecasted values averaged over multiple runs yielded the best performance in the three cases studied. Third, the correlations in terms of the MIC between the global climate indices and streamflow were lower than those between local weather information and streamflow, and the best wrapper and FIVS would select more local weather information variables than global climate index variables, which suggests that global climate information can be complementary to local weather information for one-step monthly streamflow forecasting. These findings have remarkable practical applications for forecasting monthly streamflow.",https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jhydrol.2021.126152,10.1016/j.jhydrol.2021.126152,"Ren, Kun; Wang, Xue; Shi, Xiaoyu; Qu, Jihong; Fang, Wei",JOURNAL OF HYDROLOGY,Streamflow forecasting; Input variable selection; Binary metaheuristic algorithm; Wrapper method; Machine learning,ARTIFICIAL NEURAL-NETWORKS; SUPPORT VECTOR REGRESSION; MACHINE LEARNING-METHODS; SHORT-TERM; DATA SET; MODEL; WAVELET; TIME; ALGORITHMS; PREDICTION,,ELSEVIER,AMSTERDAM,"RADARWEG 29, 1043 NX AMSTERDAM, NETHERLANDS",0022-1694,1879-2707,,J HYDROL,J.

The present method implies the optimization of the SVR hyperparameters during the training process. In addition, five other SVR models with different nuclei (linear, quadratic, cubic, sigmoid and radial base function) and random forests (RF) were adjusted to experimental data for purposes of comparison. In addition to successfully predicting atypical algae growth (determination coefficients equal to 0.88 and 0.93), the model shown here can establish the importance of each biological and physicochemical parameter of improved algae growth. Finally, the main conclusions of this research work are presented. (C) 2019 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.",https://doi.org/10.1016/j.cam.2019.112417,10.1016/j.cam.2019.112417,"Garcia-Nieto, P.

227,Application and Sensitivity Analysis of Artificial Neural Network for Prediction of Chemical Oxygen Demand,"Integrating water quality forecasting model with river restoration techniques makes river restoration more effective and efficient. This research investigates how to use the Artificial Neural Network (ANN) to predict the Chemical Oxygen Demand (COD) during river restoration in Wuxi city, China. Specifically, we applied a Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP) using ten neurons in a single hidden layer and seven input variables (Temperature, Dissolved Oxygen, Total Nitrogen, Total Phosphorus, Suspended Sediment, Transparency, and NH3-N) to simulate COD. The modeled results have a correlation coefficient of 0.966, 0.949, and 0.890 with the observations for the raining, validation, and testing phases, respectively. When presenting the trained network to an independent data set, the ANN model still shows a good predictive capability, indicating by a correlation coefficient of 0.978, a root mean square error (RMSE) of 0.628 mg/L, and a mean square error (MSE) of 0.394 mg(2)/L-2. A sensitivity analysis was further implemented to analyze the effect of each of the input variables on prediction of COD. DO, TO, and Transparency have relatively low influences on the estimate of COD, and can be removed from the input variables. The results from this study indicate that ANN models can provide satisfactory estimates of COD during the process of bacterial treatment and is a useful supportive tool for river restoration.",https://doi.org/10.1007/s11269-017-1809-0,10.1007/s11269-017-1809-0,"Ruben, Gebdang B.; Zhang, Ke; Bao, Hongjun; Ma, Xirong",WATER RESOURCES MANAGEMENT,Artificial neural network; Chemical oxygen demand; Water pollution; River restoration,BACTERIAL TECHNOLOGY; MODEL; EVAPOTRANSPIRATION; RIVERS,,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0920-4741,1573-1650,,WATER RESOUR MANAG,Water Resour.

228,Improving Water Quality Index prediction for water resources management plans in Malaysia: application of machine learning techniques,"Proper modeling of groundwater quality is an important planning and decision-making tool in water resources management and environment. Due to the fact that forecasting and determining groundwater quality helps in planning and managing groundwater, in this study we tried to use intelligent models with different functions to predict Water Quality Index (WQI). The traditional methods to compute the WQI is time consuming and have errors in sub-indexes derivations. Three different Machine learning (ML) techniques are applied to a 1080 data of Kelang River which collected from 27 sampling sites in the dry season (January/February, 2014) and wet season (October/November, 2014) to predict WQI. For modeling with ML algorithms six effective input parameters are considered and 70% of all data were used for training stage and 30% for testing stage. All three models demonstrated a good performance in prediction of WQI but the LSTM algorithm with R-2 = 0.986, RMSE = 1.383, MAE= 0.924 and NSE = 0.992 showed the best performance than those of other models.",https://doi.org/10.1080/10106049.2022.2032388,10.1080/10106049.2022.2032388,"Khozani, Zohreh Sheikh; Iranmehr, Milad; Mohtar, Wan Hanna Melini Wan",GEOCARTO INTERNATIONAL,LSTM; machine learning; Malaysia; prediction; Water Quality Index,ARTIFICIAL NEURAL-NETWORK; SCATTER PLOT; RIVER; MODEL; STREAMFLOW; TIME,,TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD,ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OR14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1010-6049,1752-0762,,GEOCARTO INT,Geocarto Int.,,,,,,,,
229,Middle- and Long-Term Streamflow Forecasting and Uncertainty Analysis Using Lasso-DBN-Bootstrap Model,"Middle-term and long-term streamflow forecasting is of great significance for water resources planning and management, cascade reservoirs optimal operation, agriculture and hydro-power generation. In this work, a framework was proposed which integrates least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (lasso), DBN and bootstrap to improve the performance and the stability of streamflow forecasting with the lead-time of one month. Lasso helps to screen the appropriate predictors for the DBN model, and the DBN model simulates the complex relationship between the selection predictors and streamflow, and then bootstrap with the DBN model contributes to evaluate the uncertainty. The Three-River Headwaters Region (TRHR) was taken as a case study. The results indicated that lasso-DBN-bootstrap model produced significantly more accurate forecasting results than the other three models and provides reliable information on the forecasting uncertainty, which will be valuable for water resources management and planning.",https://doi.org/10.1007/s11269-021-02854-y,10.1007/s11269-021-02854-y,"Chu, Haibo; Wei, Jiahua; Jiang, Yuan",WATER RESOURCES MANAGEMENT,Middle-term and long-term streamflow forecasting; Lasso; Deep belief networks (DBN); Bootstrap; Three-River headwaters region (TRHR),NEURAL-NETWORK; BELIEF; RUNOFF; SIMULATION; SELECTION; RIVER,,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0920-4741,1573-1650,,WATER RESOUR MANAG,Water Resour.

230,Application of the HBV model for the future projections of water levels using dynamically downscaled global climate model data,"The Hydrologiska Byrans Vattenbalansavdelning (HBV) model was used to project the future water levels of the Mackenzie River at selected stations. The Weather Research and Forecasting (WRF) model was utilized to dynamically downscale the Global Climate Model data. The calibrated and validated HBV model was run with the WRF downscaled CanESM2 data and with the PCIC data for the historical (1979-2005) period, and then compared with the observed flow data at the Fort Simpson station and the Arctic Red River station. The simulated streamflow showed a good correlation with the observed streamflow (R-2 value was around 0.85). The HBV model was then forced with the bias-corrected WRF downscaled daily rainfall and temperature data driven by the CanESM2 RCP 4.5 and RCP 8.5 climate scenarios to simulate the future streamflow for the 2041-2070 period. Rating curves were used to convert streamflow to water levels. At the Fort Simpson station, mean flow was projected to decrease by about 5% under both RCP 4.5 and RCP 8.5 scenarios, whereas the peak flow likely to reduce by about 12 and 9% for RCP 4.5 and RCP 8.5 scenarios, respectively, in the 2050s. The projected lower water levels could affect the navigability and the northern ferry operations of the Mackenzie River.",https://doi.org/10.2166/wcc.2021.302,10.2166/wcc.2021.302,"Pervin, Lia; Gan, Thian Yew; Scheepers, Hester; Islam, Md Saiful",JOURNAL OF WATER AND CLIMATE CHANGE,downscaling; future projection; GCM; HBV model; water level; WRF model,,,IWA PUBLISHING,LONDON,"REPUBLIC-EXPORT BLDG, UNITS 1 04 & 1 05, 1 CLOVE CRESCENT, LONDON, ENGLAND",2040-2244,2408-9354,,J WATER CLIM CHANGE,J.

231,Evaluating the capability of hybrid data-driven approaches to forecast monthly streamflow using hydrometric and meteorological variables,"Streamflow forecasting, as one of the most important issues in hydrological studies, plays a vital role in several aspects of water resources management such as reservoir operation, water allocation, and flood forecasting. In this study, wavelet-gene expression programming (WGEP) and wavelet-M5 prime (WM5P) techniques, as two robust artificial intelligence (AI) models, were applied for forecasting the monthly streamflow in Khoshkroud and Polroud Rivers located in two basins with the same names. Results of hybrid AI techniques were compared with those achieved by two stand-alone models of GEP and M5P. Seven combinations of hydrological (H) and meteorological (M) variables were considered to investigate the effect of climatic variables on the performance of the proposed techniques. Moreover, the performance of both stand-alone and hybrid models were evaluated by statistical criteria of correlation of coefficient, root-mean-square error, index of agreement, the Nash-Sutcliffe model efficiency coefficient, and relative improvement. The statistical results revealed that there is a dependency between 'the M5P and GEP performance' and 'the geometric properties of basins (e.g., area, shape, slope, and river network density)'. It was found that a preprocessed technique could increase the performance of M5P and GEP models. Compared to the stand-alone techniques, the hybrid AI models resulted in higher performance. For both basins, the performance of the WM5P model was higher than the WGEP model, especially for extreme events. Overall, the results demonstrated that the proposed hybrid AI approaches are reliable tools for forecasting the monthly streamflow, while the meteorological and hydrometric variables are taken into account.",https://doi.org/10.2166/hydro.2021.105,10.2166/hydro.2021.105,"Azarpira, Fariba; Shahabi, Sajad",JOURNAL OF HYDROINFORMATICS,gene expression programming; model tree; time series; wavelet,NEURAL-NETWORKS; MODEL TREES; WAVELET; RIVER; PREDICTION,,IWA PUBLISHING,LONDON,"REPUBLIC-EXPORT BLDG, UNITS 1 04 & 1 05, 1 CLOVE CRESCENT, LONDON, ENGLAND",1464-7141,1465-1734,,J HYDROINFORM,J.

233,An intercomparison of approaches for improving operational seasonal streamflow forecasts,"For much of the last century, forecasting centers around the world have offered seasonal streamflow predictions to support water management. Recent work suggests that the two major avenues to advance seasonal predictability are improvements in the estimation of initial hydrologic conditions (IHCs) and the incorporation of climate information. This study investigates the marginal benefits of a variety of methods using IHCs and/or climate information, focusing on seasonal water supply forecasts (WSFs) in five case study watersheds located in the US Pacific Northwest region. We specify two benchmark methods that mimic standard operational approaches - statistical regression against IHCs and model-based ensemble streamflow prediction (ESP) - and then systematically intercompare WSFs across a range of lead times. Additional methods include (i) statistical techniques using climate information either from standard indices or from climate reanalysis variables and (ii) several hybrid/hierarchical approaches harnessing both land surface and climate predictability. In basins where atmospheric tele-connection signals are strong, and when watershed predictability is low, climate information alone provides considerable improvements. For those basins showing weak tele-connections, custom predictors from reanalysis fields were more effective in forecast skill than standard climate indices. ESP predictions tended to have high correlation skill but greater bias compared to other methods, and climate predictors failed to substantially improve these deficiencies within a trace weighting framework. Lower complexity techniques were competitive with more complex methods, and the hierarchical expert regression approach introduced here (hierarchical ensemble streamflow prediction - HESP) provided a robust alternative for skillful and reliable water supply forecasts at all initialization times. Three key findings from this effort are (1) objective approaches supporting methodologically consistent hindcasts open the door to a broad range of beneficial forecasting strategies; (2) the use of climate predictors can add to the seasonal forecast skill available from IHCs; and (3) sample size limitations must be handled rigorously to avoid over-trained forecast solutions. Overall, the results suggest that despite a rich, long heritage of operational use, there remain a number of compelling opportunities to improve the skill and value of seasonal streamflow predictions.",https://doi.org/10.5194/hess-21-3915-2017,10.5194/hess-21-3915-2017,"Mendoza, Pablo A.; Wood, Andrew W.; Clark, Elizabeth; Rothwell, Eric; Clark, Martyn P.; Nijssen, Bart; Brekke, Levi D.; Arnold, Jeffrey R.",HYDROLOGY AND EARTH SYSTEM SCIENCES,,WESTERN UNITED-STATES; EL-NINO; CLIMATE; PREDICTION; SYSTEM; PREDICTABILITY; PRECIPITATION; VARIABILITY; REGRESSION; FRAMEWORK,,COPERNICUS GESELLSCHAFT MBH,GOTTINGEN,"BAHNHOFSALLEE 1E, GOTTINGEN, 37081, GERMANY",1027-5606,1607-7938,,HYDROL EARTH SYST SC,Hydrol.

234,A cultivated area forecasting approach in artificial oases under climate change and human activities,"The cultivated area in artificial oases is deeply influenced by global climate change and human activities. Thus, forecasting cultivated area in artificial oases under climate change and human activities is of great significance. In this study, an approach named GD-HM-PSWROAM, consisting of general circulation model downscaling (GD), hydrological model (HM), and planting structure and water resource optimal allocation model (PSWROAM), was developed and applied in the irrigation district of the Manas River Basin in Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region of China to forecast the cultivated area tendency. Furthermore, the catchment export of the MIKE11 HD/NAM model was set to the Kensiwate hydrological station. The results show that the downscaling effects of temperature can be fairly satisfying, while those of precipitation may be not satisfying but acceptable. Simulation capacity of the MIKE11 HD/NAM model on the discharge in the Kensiwate hydrological station can meet the requirements of running the PSWROAM. The accuracy of the PSWROAM indicated that this model can perform well in predicting the change of cultivated area at the decadal scale. The cultivated area in the Manas River Basin under current human activities may be generally decreasing due to the climate change. But the adverse effects of climate change can be weakened or even eliminated through positive human activities. The cultivated area in the Manas River Basin may even be increasing under assumed human activities and future climate scenarios. The effects of human activities in the future can be generally predicted and quantified according to the cultivated area trends under current human activities and the situations in the study area. Overall, it is rational and acceptable to forecast the cultivated area tendency in artificial oases under future climate change and human activities through the GD-HM-PSWROAM approach.",https://doi.org/10.1007/s40333-019-0056-z,10.1007/s40333-019-0056-z,"Zhang, Shaobo; Chen, Fulong; Chen, Jie; Wang, Jing; Li, Shaofei; Long, Aihua",JOURNAL OF ARID LAND,GCM downscaling; hydrological model; cultivated area; climate change; human activities; Manas River Basin,TARIM RIVER-BASIN; WATER-RESOURCES; GLACIER CHANGES; SWAT MODEL; MIKE SHE; RUNOFF; SYSTEM; VARIABILITY; CALIBRATION; MANAGEMENT,,SPRINGER HEIDELBERG,HEIDELBERG,"TIERGARTENSTRASSE 17, D-69121 HEIDELBERG, GERMANY",1674-6767,2194-7783,,J ARID LAND,J.

235,Real-time optimization of a large-scale reservoir operation in Thailand using adaptive inflow prediction with medium-range ensemble precipitation forecasts,"Study region: The Sirikit Dam in the Nan River Basin is located on a main tributary of the Chao Phraya River in Thailand. Study focus: This study investigates forecasting river flows and real-time optimization of dam release using a distributed hydrological model with ensemble weather forecasting for reservoir operations which provide hydropower and irrigation facilities in Thailand during a case study of the 2019 drought event. Medium-range ensemble precipitation forecasts were employed using a hydrological model to predict the real-time reservoir inflow. Real-time optimization of the water release strategy determined a week in advance with an effective initial condition for hydropower generation and irrigation was conducted with different scenarios using dynamic programming considering inflow predictions. New hydrological insights for the region: The medium-range ensemble precipitation forecast con-ducted by the European Centre for Medium Range Weather Forecasts was used to quantify pre-cipitation for the study basin. The ensemble precipitation forecast with the hydrological model was employed for inflow prediction of the study basin which was located in a tropical climate with a distinct wet and dry season. The initial conditions of the hydrological model largely influenced the real-time inflow forecast. To determine the initial conditions of the model, the empirical data assimilation considering a drainage area factor was utilized and observed pre-cipitation data were used for model input forcing data during the initial analysis period. This method improved the reservoir inflow prediction and real-time reservoir optimization using dynamic programming with considering ensemble forecasts provided more efficient operating decisions than employing historical data. The resulting information will be useful for water resource management, which may be adapted to other basins in the study region.",https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ejrh.2021.100939,10.1016/j.ejrh.2021.100939,"Meema, Thatkiat; Tachikawa, Yasuto; Ichikawa, Yutaka; Yorozu, Kazuaki",JOURNAL OF HYDROLOGY-REGIONAL STUDIES,Ensemble inflow forecasting; Data assimilation; Distributed hydrologic model; Reservoir optimization; Dynamic programing; Thailand,CHAO-PHRAYA RIVER; ECONOMIC VALUE; CLIMATE; MULTIMODEL; DISCHARGE; FLOODS; MODEL; BASIN,,ELSEVIER,AMSTERDAM,"RADARWEG 29, 1043 NX AMSTERDAM, NETHERLANDS",,2214-5818,,J HYDROL-REG STUD,J.

236,Metamodeling for Groundwater Age Forecasting in the Lake Michigan Basin,"Groundwater age is an important indicator of groundwater susceptibility to anthropogenic contamination and a key input to statistical models for forecasting water quality. Numerical models can provide estimates of groundwater age, enabling interpretation of measured age tracers. However, to extend to national-scale groundwater systems where numerical models are not routinely available, a more efficient metamodeling approach can provide a less precise but widely applicable estimate of groundwater age, trained to make forecasts based on predictor variables that can be measured independent of numerical models. We trained gradient-boosted regression tree statistical metamodels to MODFLOW/MODPATH-derived groundwater age estimates in five inset models in the Lake Michigan Basin, USA. Using high-throughput computing, we explored an exhaustive range of tuning parameters and tested metamodels through cross validation, a 20% holdout, and a round robin approach among the five inset models withholding each inset model from training and testing on the held-out inset model. Forecast skill-measured by Nash Sutcliffe efficiency-was high for age-related responses in the 20% hold-out case (ranging from 0.73 to 0.84). The round robin analysis provided the opportunity to explore extending to unmodeled areas and a greater range of skill indicated the need to evaluate when it is appropriate to apply a metamodel from one region to another. We further explored the ramifications of metamodel simplification achieved through removing predictor variables based on their estimated importance. We found that similar metamodel performance was achievable with a fraction of the candidate set of predictor variables with well construction variables being most important. Plain Language Summary Constructing computer models of groundwater and making forecasts to help water resource managers can both be time consuming. Metamodeling takes advantage of recent advances in artificial intelligence to make simple, fast-running statistical models learned from paired inputs and outputs generated by a more complicated computer model. These metamodels are easier to construct, based on salient environmental characteristics, which can be obtained using maps spanning large scale. When metamodels adequately duplicate the underlying model behavior, they can be extended into previously unmodeled areas. In this work, we created metamodels to forecast groundwater age in pumping wells in the Lake Michigan Basin. Groundwater extracted from wells represents a mixture of water ranging in age from recent to thousands of years old. Water younger than 65years old is more likely to contain nitrate as this time period saw high use of inorganic nitrogen for agricultural fertilizer resulting in nitrate entering the groundwater. The ability to rapidly create a metamodel of a previously unmodeled area allows forecasting and mapping groundwater age over large regions. Our metamodels reproduce 73% to 84% of the underlying training model information. This prototype screening approach, with age indicating nitrate vulnerability, can be extended for planning new well locations throughout the glaciated northern United States.",https://doi.org/10.1029/2017WR022387,10.1029/2017WR022387,"Fienen, Michael N.; Nolan, B.

237,Comparative study of forecasting approaches in monthly streamflow series from Brazilian hydroelectric plants using Extreme Learning Machines and Box & Jenkins models,"Several activities regarding water resources management are dependent on accurate monthly streamflow forecasting, such as flood control, reservoir operation, water supply planning, hydropower generation, energy matrix planning, among others. Most of the literature is focused on propose, compare, and evaluate the forecasting models. However, the decision on forecasting approaches plays a significant role in such models' performance. In this paper, we are focused on investigating and confront the following forecasting approaches: i) use of a single model for the whole series (annual approach) versus using 12 models, each one responsible for predicting each month (monthly approach); ii) for multistep forecasting, the use of direct and recursive methods. The forecasting models addressed are the linear Autoregressive (AR) and Periodic Autoregressive (PAR) models, from the Box & Jenkins family, and the Extreme Learning Machines (ELM), an artificial neural network architecture. The computational analysis involves 20 time series associated with hydroelectric plants indicated that the monthly approach with the direct multistep method achieved the best overall performances, except for the cases in which the coefficient of variation is higher than two. In this case, the recursive approach stood out. Also, the ELM overcame the linear models in most cases.",https://doi.org/10.2478/johh-2021-0001,10.2478/johh-2021-0001,"Belotti, Jonatas; Mendes Jr, Jose Jair; Leme, Murilo; Trojan, Flavio; Stevan Jr, Sergio L.; Siqueira, Hugo",JOURNAL OF HYDROLOGY AND HYDROMECHANICS,Streamflow series prediction; Multistep forecasting; Monthly approach; Box & Jenkins models; Extreme Learning Machines,SUPPORT VECTOR REGRESSION; NEURAL-NETWORKS; UNORGANIZED MACHINES; CLASSIFICATION; PREDICTION; ALGORITHM; RIVER,,SCIENDO,WARSAW,"BOGUMILA ZUGA 32A, WARSAW, MAZOVIA, POLAND",,1338-4333,,J HYDROL HYDROMECH,J.

238,Forecasted range shifts of arid-land fishes in response to climate change,"Climate change is poised to alter the distributional limits, center, and size of many species. Traits may influence different aspects of range shifts, with trophic generality facilitating shifts at the leading edge, and greater thermal tolerance limiting contractions at the trailing edge. The generality of relationships between traits and range shifts remains ambiguous however, especially for imperiled fishes residing in xeric riverscapes. Our objectives were to quantify contemporary fish distributions in the Lower Colorado River Basin, forecast climate change by 2085 using two general circulation models, and quantify shifts in the limits, center, and size of fish elevational ranges according to fish traits. We examined relationships among traits and range shift metrics either singly using univariate linear modeling or combined with multivariate redundancy analysis. We found that trophic and dispersal traits were associated with shifts at the leading and trailing edges, respectively, although projected range shifts were largely unexplained by traits. As expected, piscivores and omnivores with broader diets shifted upslope most at the leading edge while more specialized invertivores exhibited minimal changes. Fishes that were more mobile shifted upslope most at the trailing edge, defying predictions. No traits explained changes in range center or size. Finally, current preference explained multivariate range shifts, as fishes with faster current preferences exhibited smaller multivariate changes. Although range shifts were largely unexplained by traits, more specialized invertivorous fishes with lower dispersal propensity or greater current preference may require the greatest conservation efforts because of their limited capacity to shift ranges under climate change.",https://doi.org/10.1007/s11160-017-9479-9,10.1007/s11160-017-9479-9,"Whitney, James E.; Whittier, Joanna B.; Paukert, Craig P.; Olden, Julian D.; Strecker, Angela L.",REVIEWS IN FISH BIOLOGY AND FISHERIES,Climate change; Imperiled fish; Nonnative fish; Range shifts; Rivers; Trait-based approach,FRESH-WATER FISHES; SPECIES TRAITS; PHYLOGENETIC CONSERVATISM; POTENTIAL IMPACTS; DISTRIBUTIONS; MARINE; RIVER; PREDICT; LIFE; VULNERABILITY,,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0960-3166,1573-5184,,REV FISH BIOL FISHER,Rev.

239,Genetic-Algorithm-Optimized Sequential Model for Water Temperature Prediction,"Advances in establishing real-time river water quality monitoring networks combined with novel artificial intelligence techniques for more accurate forecasting is at the forefront of urban water management. The preservation and improvement of the quality of our impaired urban streams are at the core of the global challenge of ensuring water sustainability. This work adopted a genetic-algorithm (GA)-optimized long short-term memory (LSTM) technique to predict river water temperature (WT) as a key indicator of the health state of the aquatic habitat, where its modeling is crucial for effective urban water quality management. To our knowledge, this is the first attempt to adopt a GA-LSTM to predict the WT in urban rivers. In recent research trends, large volumes of real-time water quality data, including water temperature, conductivity, pH, and turbidity, are constantly being collected. Specifically, in the field of water quality management, this provides countless opportunities for understanding water quality impairment and forecasting, and to develop models for aquatic habitat assessment purposes. The main objective of this research was to develop a reliable and simple urban river water temperature forecasting tool using advanced machine learning methods that can be used in conjunction with a real-time network of water quality monitoring stations for proactive water quality management. We proposed a hybrid time series regression model for WT forecasting. This hybrid approach was applied to solve problems regarding the time window size and architectural factors (number of units) of the LSTM network. We have chosen an hourly water temperature record collected over 5 years as the input. Furthermore, to check its robustness, a recurrent neural network (RNN) was also tested as a benchmark model and the performances were compared. The experimental results revealed that the hybrid model of the GA-LSTM network outperformed the RNN and the basic problem of determining the optimal time window and number of units of the memory cell was solved. This research concluded that the GA-LSTM can be used as an advanced deep learning technique for time series analysis.",https://doi.org/10.3390/su12135374,10.3390/su12135374,"Stajkowski, Stephen; Kumar, Deepak; Samui, Pijush; Bonakdari, Hossein; Gharabaghi, Bahram",SUSTAINABILITY,sequential model; water temperature; LSTM; genetic algorithm,ARTIFICIAL NEURAL-NETWORK; SUPPORT VECTOR MACHINES; STREAM TEMPERATURE; RIVER TEMPERATURE; QUALITY; DECOMPOSITION; URBANIZATION; IMPACTS; TORONTO; SYSTEMS,,MDPI,BASEL,"ST ALBAN-ANLAGE 66, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND",,2071-1050,,SUSTAINABILITY-BASEL,Sustainability,JUL,2020,12,13,,,5374,
240,Forecasting reservoir monthly runoff via ensemble empirical mode decomposition and extreme learning machine optimized by an improved gravitational search algorithm,"Monthly streamflow prediction plays a significant role in reservoir operation and water resource management. Hence, this research tries to develop a hybrid model for accurate monthly streamflow prediction, where the ensemble empirical mode decomposition (EEMD) is firstly used to decompose the original streamflow data into a finite amount of intrinsic mode functions (IMFs) and a residue; and then the extreme learning machine (ELM) is employed to forecast each IMFs and the residue, while an improved gravitational search algorithm (IGSA) based on elitist-guide evolution strategies, selection operator and mutation operator is used to select the parameters of all the ELM models; finally, the summarized predicated results for all the subcomponents are treated as the final forecasting result. The hybrid method is applied to forecast the monthly runoff of Three Gorges in China, while four quantitative indexes are used to test the performances of the developed forecasting models.

241,Predicting current and future background ion concentrations in German surface water under climate change,"Salinization of surface waters is a global environmental issue that can pose a regional risk to freshwater organisms, potentially leading to high environmental and economic costs. Global environmental change including climate and land use change can increase the transport of ions into surface waters. We fit both multiple linear regression (LR) and random forest (RF) models on a large spatial dataset to predict Ca2+ (266 sites), Mg2+ (266 sites), and SO42- (357 sites) ion concentrations as well as electrical conductivity (EC-a proxy for total dissolved solids with 410 sites) in German running water bodies. Predictions in both types of models were driven by the major factors controlling salinity including geologic and soil properties, climate, vegetation and topography. The predictive power of the two types of models was very similar, with RF explaining 71-76% of the spatial variation in ion concentrations and LR explaining 70-75% of the variance. Mean squared errors for predictions were all smaller than 0.06. The factors most strongly associated with stream ion concentrations varied among models but rock chemistry and climate were the most dominant. The RF model was subsequently used to forecast the changes in EC that were likely to occur for the period of 2070 to 2100 in response to just climate change-i.e. no additional effects of other anthropogenic activities. The future forecasting shows approximately 10% and 15% increases in mean EC for representative concentration pathways 2.6 and 8.5 (RCP2.6 and RCP8.5) scenarios, respectively.

242,A Brief review of flood forecasting techniques and their applications,"Flood forecasting (FF) is one the most challenging and difficult problems in hydrology. However, it is also one of the most important problems in hydrology due to its critical contribution in reducing economic and life losses. In many regions of the world, flood forecasting is one among the few feasible options to manage floods. Reliability of forecasts has increased in the recent years due to the integration of meteorological and hydrological modelling capabilities, improvements in data collection through satellite observations, and advancements in knowledge and algorithms for analysis and communication of uncertainties. The present paper reviews different aspects of flood forecasting, including the models being used, emerging techniques of collecting inputs and displaying results, uncertainties, and warnings. In the end, future directions for research and development are identified.",https://doi.org/10.1080/15715124.2017.1411920,10.1080/15715124.2017.1411920,"Jain, Sharad Kumar; Mani, Pankaj; Jain, Sanjay K.; Prakash, Pavithra; Singh, Vijay P.; Tullos, Desiree; Kumar, Sanjay; Agarwal, S.

243,Rainfall forecast in the Upper Mahaweli basin in Sri Lanka using RegCM model,"The Upper Mahaweli basin is the upper most sub basin of 788 km2 in size above Polgolla barrage in the Mahaweli River, the longest river in Sri Lanka which starts from the central hills of the island and drains to the sea at the North-east coast Rainfall forecast in the Upper Mahaweli basin is important for issuing flood warning in the river downstream of the reservoirs, landslide warning in the settlements in hilly areas. Anticipatory water management in the basin including reservoir operations, barrage gate operation for releasing water for irrigation and flood control also require reliable rainfall and runoff prediction in the sub basin. In this study, the Regional Climate Model (RegCM V4.4.5.11) is calibrated for the basin to dynamically downscale reanalysis weather data of Global Climate Model (GCM) to forecast the rainfall in the basin. Observed rainfalls at gauging stations within the basin were used for model calibration and validation. The observed rainfall data was analysed using ARC GIS and the output of RegCM was analysed using GrADS tool. The output of the model and the observed precipitation were obtained on grids of size 0.1 degrees and the accuracy of the predictions were analysed using RMSE and Mean Model Absolute Error percentage (MAME %). The predictions by the calibrated RegCM model for the basin is shown to be satisfactory. The model is a useful tool for rainfall forecast in the Upper Mahaweli River basin.",https://doi.org/10.1088/1742-6596/822/1/012075,10.1088/1742-6596/822/1/012075,"Muhammadh, K. M.; Mafas, M. M.

244,From skill to value: isolating the influence of end user behavior on seasonal forecast assessment,"Recent improvements in initialization procedures and representation of large-scale hydrometeorological processes have contributed to advancing the accuracy of hydroclimatic forecasts, which are progressively more skillful over seasonal and longer timescales. These forecasts are potentially valuable for informing strategic multisector decisions, including irrigated agriculture, for which they can improve crop choices and irrigation scheduling. In this operational context, the accuracy associated with the forecast system setup does not necessarily yield proportional marginal benefit, as this is also affected by how forecasts are employed by end users. This paper aims at quantifying the value of hydroclimatic forecasts in terms of potential economic benefit to the end users, which allows for the inference of a relation between gains in forecast skill and gains in end user profit. We also explore the sensitivity of this benefit to both forecast system setup and end user behavioral factors. These analyses are supported by an evaluation framework demonstrated on the Lake Como system (Italy), a regulated lake operated for flood protection and irrigation supply. Our framework relies on an integrated modeling chain composed of three building blocks: bias-adjusted seasonal meteorological forecasts are used as input to the continentally calibrated E-HYPE hydrological model; predicted lake inflows are used for conditioning the daily lake operations; and the resulting lake releases feed an agricultural model to estimate the net profit of the farmers in a downstream irrigation district. Results suggest that despite the gain in average conditions being negligible, informing the operations of Lake Como based on seasonal hydrological forecasts during intense drought episodes allows about 15 % of the farmers' profit to be gained with respect to a baseline solution not informed by any forecast. Moreover, our analysis suggests that behavioral factors capturing different perceptions of risk and uncertainty significantly impact the quantification of the benefit to the end users, whereby the estimated forecast value is potentially undermined by different levels of end user risk aversion. Lastly, our results show an intricate skill-to-value relation modulated by the underlying hydrologic conditions, which is well aligned over an exponential function in dry years, while the gains in profit are almost insensitive to the improvements in forecast skill in wet years.",https://doi.org/10.5194/hess-24-5891-2020,10.5194/hess-24-5891-2020,"Giuliani, Matteo; Crochemore, Louise; Pechlivanidis, Ilias; Castelletti, Andrea",HYDROLOGY AND EARTH SYSTEM SCIENCES,,WATER MANAGEMENT; DECISION-MAKING; UNCERTAINTY; INFORMATION; MODEL; OPERATIONS; POLICIES; WEATHER; SYSTEM; LEAD,,COPERNICUS GESELLSCHAFT MBH,GOTTINGEN,"BAHNHOFSALLEE 1E, GOTTINGEN, 37081, GERMANY",1027-5606,1607-7938,,HYDROL EARTH SYST SC,Hydrol.

245,Identification of Combined Hydrological Models and Numerical Weather Predictions for Enhanced Flood Forecasting in a Semiurban Watershed,"Flood forecasting in urban and semiurban catchments is often limited by the capability of the combined hydrological models and forecast inputs to predict floods accurately. The objective of this research is to develop an approach (1) to identify the best model forecast from multiple integrations of various hydrological models and numerical weather predictions (NWP), and (2) to find the best forecast combination method for an improved short-range flood forecasting. Seven selected hydrological models were coupled, each with two high-resolution NWP forecasts to provide several alternatives of deterministic hydrological forecasts at a catchment outlet. As such, the different model-input combinations were used to generate 14 hydrological forecasts. Hydrological forecast verification was then carried out over a one-year hind-cast period. A comparison between six forecast combination methods, including a benchmark Bayesian model averaging (BMA) method, was also performed for the multiple available short-term streamflow forecasts. Results indicate that the coupling of the Sacramento soil moisture accounting (SACSMA) model with both High-Resolution Deterministic Precipitation System and High-Resolution Rapid Refresh inputs outperformed other model-input integrations. Maximum forecast errors in all model-input integration outputs occurred at forecast lead times of 12-14 h, corresponding to the time of concentration of the catchment. Providing constraints on the estimation of model weights was found to be a significant factor for obtaining an improved combined streamflow forecast. In general, the regression-based forecast combination method of the constrained ordinary least squares (CLS) has emerged as a possible alternative to the widely used BMA method for hydrology application.

246,Supply and Demand Forecasting of Water Resource Coupling System in Upstream Yangtze River under Changing Environmental Conditions,"The upstream Yangtze River is located in the southwest of central China, where it flows through several ecosystems and densely populated regions that constitute a unique complex coupled system. To determine how the characteristics of supply and demand in a water-coupled system will vary under the influence of climate change and human activity in this area in the next 85 years, the upper Yangtze basin was considered as the study area and was divided into seven sub-basins according to seven main control sections: Shigu, Panzhihua, Xiluodu, Xiangjiaba, Zhutuo, Cuntan, and Yichang; a method for water supply and demand research considering climate change was proposed. Based on simulated runoff in the study area under changing environmental conditions, this study analyzed the available water supply and constructed a long-term water demand forecasting model using the classified water use index method under macro regulation in the study area from 2016 to 2100. The results show that the total water demand in the upstream Yangtze River appears to first increase and then decrease in 2016-2100 and will reach its peak around 2028. The ecological pressure in the upstream Yangtze River increases gradually from upstream to downstream but will not reach the surface water utilization stress threshold (hereinafter referred to as stress threshold) for the next 85 years. The contradiction between monthly supply and demand is more prominent under ecological restrictions. Under the RCP4.5 scenario, water demand exceeds the stress threshold in each sub-basin across several months (mainly March, April, and May), and the water demand nearly reaches the damage threshold in May as the basin extends below the Zhutuo section.",https://doi.org/10.3390/w13050640,10.3390/w13050640,"Lou, Sijing; Mo, Li; Zhou, Jianzhong; Wang, Yongqiang; He, Wenhao",WATER,water supply and demand analysis; water demand forecasting; Yangtze River,,,MDPI,BASEL,"ST ALBAN-ANLAGE 66, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND",,2073-4441,,WATER-SUI,Water,MAR,2021,13,5,,,640,
247,Simulation effect evaluation of single-outlet and multi-outlet calibration of Soil and Water Assessment Tool model driven by Climate Forecast System Reanalysis data and ground-based meteorological station data - a case study in a Yellow River source,"It is the research hotspot in the field of hydrology to apply the climate model and its downscaling data into hydrological simulations, and it is very important to evaluate the accuracy of its data. In this study, the accuracy of Climate Forecast System Reanalysis (CFSR) was evaluated from two perspectives: statistical evaluation and hydrological evaluation. In the hydrological evaluation, the applicability of CFSR in the Soil and Water Assessment Tool (SWAT) model of the Yellow River source area was studied. The results show that CFSR temperature data at the source of the Yellow River is consistent with the measured temperature data, and CFSR precipitation data overestimates precipitation. In the Yellow River source runoff simulation, the SWAT model driven by CFSR can obtain satisfactory simulation results. It does not reduce the simulation accuracy at the total outlet of the basin under the multi-outlet calibration method. It also considers the spatial differences of hydrological characteristics of each sub-basin and improve the simulation accuracy of the sub-basin simulation.",https://doi.org/10.2166/ws.2020.312,10.2166/ws.2020.312,"Li, Kai; Wang, Yongqiang; Li, Xiaodong; Yuan, Zhe; Xu, Jijun",WATER SUPPLY,CFSR; multi-outlet calibration; single-outlet calibration; SWAT model; Yellow River source,HIGH-RESOLUTION SATELLITE,,IWA PUBLISHING,LONDON,"ALLIANCE HOUSE, 12 CAXTON ST, LONDON SW1H0QS, ENGLAND",1606-9749,1607-0798,,WATER SUPPLY,Water Supply,MAY,2021,21,3,1061,1071,,
248,Hydroclimate Variability and Change over the Mekong River Basin: Modeling and Predictability and Policy Implications,"The Mekong River is the lifeblood of the Southeast (SE) Asian economies. In situ and satellite-based precipitation are analyzed to assess the amount of water received as precipitation in the river basin (Mekong basin water), in particular, the amount each country receives. Laos, Thailand, and Cambodia contribute -75% of the basin water during March-September, whereas China's contribution is 10%-15%, except in winter when it rises to 25%. The processing of Mekong basin water into Mekong streamflow entails accounting for the uncertain water losses but, interestingly, interannual variations in Mekong basin water can be processed into Mekong streamflow using a simple hydrologic model, which is validated using monthly river discharge data from four stations. Preliminary evidence for the impact of upbasin dams on downstream flow, especially the timing of peak summer flow, is presented. Characterization of El Nifio's influence on SE Asian rainfall reveals significant rainfall reductions in the fall preceding and the spring following El Nirio's peak phase (winter); such reductions at the bookends of the dry season in SE Asia (winter) generate droughts, as in 2015-16. The linear trend in twentieth-century rainfall assesses the vulnerability of the region to climate change. The analysis indicates the feasibility of streamflow prediction using a simple hydrologic model driven by high-resolution precipitation observations and forecasts. It raises the prospects of drought prediction based on El Nirio's emergence/forecast. Finally, by showing the Mekong to be largely a rain-fed and not snowmelt-fed river, it provides quantitative context for assessing the notion of Chinese control on the lower Mekong via upbasin dams.",https://doi.org/10.1175/JHM-D-17-0195.1,10.1175/JHM-D-17-0195.1,"Ruiz-Barradas, Alfredo; Nigam, Sumant",JOURNAL OF HYDROMETEOROLOGY,,INDO-CHINA PENINSULA; SUMMER MONSOON; PRECIPITATION; CLIMATE; WATER; ENSO; PACIFIC; ASIA,,AMER METEOROLOGICAL SOC,BOSTON,"45 BEACON ST, BOSTON, MA 02108-3693 USA",1525-755X,1525-7541,,J HYDROMETEOROL,J.

249,The Fish Health Risk Indicator: linking water quality and river flow data with fish health to improve our predictive capacity around fish death events,"Severe drought conditions contributed to three mass fish mortality events in the Darling River near Menindee, part of the Murray-Darling Basin, Australia, during the summer of 2018-19. An independent assessment recommended the need for improved modelling approaches to identify when sections of rivers may be more susceptible to fish kill events. We present a geographic information system (GIS)-based tool that combines meteorological forecasts with river flow and algal biomass datasets to identify river reaches where additional stresses on fish health may produce an increased risk of mass fish deaths. At present the tool is still in development and will require the addition of extra datasets and testing using historical datasets to further validate its accuracy. Despite the tool being in its development stage, the decision support tool has been widely accepted and provides natural resource managers with a rapid way to understand and communicate risks to fish health, supporting improved water management options across the Murray-Darling Basin that may ultimately help reduce the frequency and severity of large-scale fish mortality events.",https://doi.org/10.1071/MF20360,10.1071/MF20360,"Davie, Alec W.; Pera, Joe B.",MARINE AND FRESHWATER RESEARCH,bony herring; Darling River; drought; fish deaths; GIS; Menindee; Murray Cod,CLIMATE-CHANGE,,CSIRO PUBLISHING,CLAYTON,"UNIPARK, BLDG 1, LEVEL 1, 195 WELLINGTON RD, LOCKED BAG 10, CLAYTON, VIC 3168, AUSTRALIA",1323-1650,1448-6059,,MAR FRESHWATER RES,Mar.

250,Dimension Reduction of Machine Learning-Based Forecasting Models Employing Principal Component Analysis,"In this research, an attempt was made to reduce the dimension of wavelet-ANFIS/ANN (artificial neural network/adaptive neuro-fuzzy inference system) models toward reliable forecasts as well as to decrease computational cost. In this regard, the principal component analysis was performed on the input time series decomposed by a discrete wavelet transform to feed the ANN/ANFIS models. The models were applied for dissolved oxygen (DO) forecasting in rivers which is an important variable affecting aquatic life and water quality. The current values of DO, water surface temperature, salinity, and turbidity have been considered as the input variable to forecast DO in a three-time step further. The results of the study revealed that PCA can be employed as a powerful tool for dimension reduction of input variables and also to detect inter-correlation of input variables. Results of the PCA-wavelet-ANN models are compared with those obtained from wavelet-ANN models while the earlier one has the advantage of less computational time than the later models. Dealing with ANFIS models, PCA is more beneficial to avoid wavelet-ANFIS models creating too many rules which deteriorate the efficiency of the ANFIS models. Moreover, manipulating the wavelet-ANFIS models utilizing PCA leads to a significant decreasing in computational time. Finally, it was found that the PCA-wavelet-ANN/ANFIS models can provide reliable forecasts of dissolved oxygen as an important water quality indicator in rivers.",https://doi.org/10.3390/math8081233,10.3390/math8081233,"Meng, Yinghui; Qasem, Sultan Noman; Shokri, Manouchehr; Shahab, S.",MATHEMATICS,machine learning; dimensionality reduction; wavelet transform; water quality; principal component analysis,PREDICTION; WAVELET; ANFIS; ANN; INFERENCE; LEVEL,,MDPI,BASEL,"ST ALBAN-ANLAGE 66, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND",,2227-7390,,MATHEMATICS-BASEL,Mathematics,AUG,2020,8,8,,,1233,
251,Long-Term Streamflow Forecasting Based on Relevance Vector Machine Model,"Long-term streamflow forecasting is crucial to reservoir scheduling and water resources management. However, due to the complexity of internally physical mechanisms in streamflow process and the influence of many random factors, long-term streamflow forecasting is a difficult issue. In the article, we mainly investigated the ability of the Relevance Vector Machine (RVM) model and its applicability for long-term streamflow forecasting. We chose the Dahuofang (DHF) Reservoir in Northern China and the Danjiangkou (DJK) Reservoir in Central China as the study sites, and selected the 500 hpa geopotential height in the northern hemisphere and the sea surface temperatures in the North Pacific as the predictor factors of the RVM model and the Support Vector Machine (SVM) model, and then conducted annual streamflow forecasting. Results indicate that forecasting results in the DHF Reservoir is much better than that in the DJK Reservoir when using SVM, because streamflow process in the latter basin has a magnitude bigger than 1000 m(3)/s. Comparatively, accurate forecasting results in both the two basins can be gotten using the RVM model, with the Nash Sutcliffe efficiency coefficient bigger than 0.7, and they are much better than those gotten from the SVM model. As a result, the RVM model can be an effective approach for long-term streamflow forecasting, and it also has a wide applicability for the streamflow process with a discharge magnitude from dozen to thousand cubic meter per second.",https://doi.org/10.3390/w9010009,10.3390/w9010009,"Liu, Yong; Sang, Yan-Fang; Li, Xinxin; Hu, Jian; Liang, Kang",Water,long-term streamflow forecasting; relevance vector machine; support vector machine; hydrological process,ARTIFICIAL NEURAL-NETWORKS; PREDICTION; RIVER; OSCILLATION; TRENDS; ERROR; FLOW,,MDPI AG,BASEL,"ST ALBAN-ANLAGE 66, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND",2073-4441,,,WATER-SUI,Water,JAN,2017,9,1,,,9,
252,Climate change impact to Mackenzie river Basin projected by a regional climate model,"A regional climate model, WRF (Weather Research and Forecasting model), was set-up and fine-tuned to simulate the possible impacts of climate change to the Mackenzie River Basin (MRB) of Canada from May to October. The baseline (1979-2005) regional climate of the MRB simulated by WRF agrees well with gridded observed climate data, ANUSPLIN of Environment Canada. Next, WRF projected the regional climate change of MRB for 2041-2100 by dynamic downscaling RCP4.5 and RCP8.5 climate scenarios of three global climate models (GCMs), ACCESS1-3, CCSM4, and CanESM2. Based on RCP4.5 and RCP8.5 climate scenarios downscaled by WRF, air temperature of MRB is projected to increase by 2.5-3.8 degrees C and 4.5-6.9 degrees C in the 2050 s and 2080 s, respectively. In general, the air temperature of MRB is projected to increase marginally higher in colder regions of higher latitude and elevation. In contrast, the seasonal precipitation of MRB is only projected to increase marginally in the 2080 s under the RCP4.5 and RCP8.5 scenarios, respectively. The projected extreme precipitation indices show that future precipitation events would become more intensive and of longer durations. Under both RCP4.5 and RCP8.5 climate scenarios, the annual counts of days with total precipitation exceeding 10 mm of MRB (R10mm) are projected to increase by 18% in 2041-2100; the maximum 5-day precipitation (Rx5day) could increase by 9.4%. More studies should be conducted to gain a better understanding of the potential impacts of global warming to MRB and possible adaptive measures to mitigate these impacts.",https://doi.org/10.1007/s00382-020-05177-7,10.1007/s00382-020-05177-7,"Kuo, Chun-Chao; Gan, Thian Yew; Wang, Jingwen",CLIMATE DYNAMICS,Mackenzie River Basin; Climate change impact; Precipitation; Temperature; Regional climate model WRF; RCP 4; 5; 8; 5 climate scenarios,MAXIMUM TEMPERATURE; TREND ANALYSIS; WATER-QUALITY; CMIP5 MODELS; LAND-USE; PRECIPITATION; STREAMFLOW; INDICATORS; CANADA; VARIABILITY,,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"ONE NEW YORK PLAZA, SUITE 4600, NEW YORK, NY, UNITED STATES",0930-7575,1432-0894,,CLIM DYNAM,Clim.

253,Support vector machine and data assimilation framework for Groundwater Level Forecasting using GRACE satellite data,"Groundwater (GW) is a vital resource for human consumption, agriculture, environmental sustainability, and socio-economic development in different parts of the world. Besides, GW plays a crucial role in minimizing the impacts during extreme drought events. However, there is a fast decline in groundwater resources due to increased sectoral water demand compounded by reduced rainfall and rising temperature. Therefore, it is essential to develop appropriate tools to study spatio-temporal dynamics and predict groundwater levels to improve water resource management, especially during drought events. In this study, we applied machine learning algorithms based on support vector machines (SVMs), combined with data assimilation (DA) technique to predict the change in groundwater levels (CGWLs) at 1 to 3-month time scales for 46 GW wells located at the northeast United States. The in-situ climate variables and the Gravity Recovery and Climate Experiment (GRACE) mission-informed groundwater anomalies data (GWA) are used to develop the models. The results suggest that SVMs (SVM-DA) models forced with limited climate variables (i.e., precipitation, solar radiation, air temperature, infrared surface temperature) can forecast the CGWLs up to 3-month lead times at most of the locations. The addition of GRACE data as a forcing variable can improve the performance of SVMs at most of the stations, where a strong relationship exists between the CGWLs and the GWA. The SVM-DA model comparatively performed better than SVMs at most of the stations.",https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jhydrol.2021.126929,10.1016/j.jhydrol.2021.126929,"Liu, Di; Mishra, Ashok K.; Yu, Zhongbo; Lu, Haishen; Li, Yajie",JOURNAL OF HYDROLOGY,Groundwater; Support vector machine; GRACE; Data assimilation,ARTIFICIAL NEURAL-NETWORK; MOISTURE DATA ASSIMILATION; TERRESTRIAL WATER STORAGE; ENSEMBLE KALMAN FILTER; SOIL-MOISTURE; AMSR-E; PARAMETER-ESTIMATION; MODEL; DROUGHT; PREDICTION,,ELSEVIER,AMSTERDAM,"RADARWEG 29, 1043 NX AMSTERDAM, NETHERLANDS",0022-1694,1879-2707,,J HYDROL,J.

254,The applicability of ASCS_LSTM_ATT model for water level prediction in small- and medium-sized basins in China,"Water level prediction of small- and medium-sized rivers plays an important role in water resource management and flood control. Such a prediction is concentrated in the flood season because of the frequent occurrence of flood disasters in the plain area. Moreover, the flood in mountainous areas suddenly rises and falls, and the slope is steep. Thus, establishing a hydrological prediction model for small- and medium-sized rivers with high accuracy and different topographic features, that is, plains and mountains, is an urgent problem. A prediction method based on ASCS_LSTM_ATT is proposed to solve this problem. First, the important parameters are optimized by improving the cuckoo search algorithm. Second, different methods are used to determine the forecast factors according to various topographic features. Finally, the model is combined with the self-attention mechanism to extract significant information. Experiments demonstrate that the proposed model has the ability to effectively improve the water level prediction accuracy and parameter optimization efficiency.",https://doi.org/10.2166/hydro.2020.043,10.2166/hydro.2020.043,"Li, Ke; Wan, Dingsheng; Zhu, Yuelong; Yao, Cheng; Yu, Yufeng; Si, Cunyou; Ruan, Xiangchao",JOURNAL OF HYDROINFORMATICS,correlation coefficient; cuckoo search algorithm; LSTM; self-attention mechanism; water level prediction,OPTIMAL OPERATION,,IWA PUBLISHING,LONDON,"REPUBLIC-EXPORT BLDG, UNITS 1 04 & 1 05, 1 CLOVE CRESCENT, LONDON, ENGLAND",1464-7141,1465-1734,,J HYDROINFORM,J.

255,A Framework to Develop Nationwide Flooding Extents Using Climate Models and Assess Forecast Potential for Flood Resilience,"The methods used to simulate flood inundation extents can be significantly improved by high-resolution spatial data captured over a large area. This paper presents a hydraulic analysis methodology and framework to estimate national-level floodplain changes likely to be generated by climate change. The hydraulic analysis was performed using existing published Federal Emergency Management Agency 100-year floodplains and estimated 100- and 10-year return period peak flow discharges. The discharges were estimated using climate variables from global climate models for two future growth scenarios: Representative Concentration Pathways 2.6 and 8.5. River channel dimensions were developed based on existing regional United States Geological Survey publications relating bankfull discharges with channel characteristics. Mathematic relationships for channel bankfull topwidth, depth, and side slope to contributing drainage area measured at model cross sections were developed. The proposed framework can be utilized at a national level to identify critical areas for flood risk assessment.

256,Demand forecast and water demand management in households in times of climate change and digitization,"Public drinking water supply increasingly has to deal with challenges resulting from climate change and transformation processes related to recent demographic and economic developments. Against this background, forecasts play an important role as basis for efficient infrastructure planning and system operation. However, traditional per capita-planning methods are not suitable anymore as forecast method and new concepts for forecasting household water demand are needed. This paper introduces a multi-scale approach for modelling and forecasting private household water demand. Based on a household survey, the major driving factors for water demand can be identified and modelled on a micro scale. By using the method of up-scaling, the results then can be generalised and transferred to the level of communities. Finally, water demand can be simulated and forecasted on a regional level, such as a river catchment or the supply area of water utilities. In addition, this paper exemplifies the water demand modelling approach using a case study from Germany focusing on the micro scale. Furthermore, modern IT-based approaches to Demand Side Management in the water sector using mobile devices, applications related to the internet of things and digital media are presented.",https://doi.org/10.1007/s35147-018-0269-7,10.1007/s35147-018-0269-7,"Yildiz, Oezguer; Ansmann, Till",WASSERWIRTSCHAFT,,,,SPRINGER VIEWEG-SPRINGER FACHMEDIEN WIESBADEN GMBH,WIESBADEN,"ABRAHAM-LINCOLN STASSE 46, WIESBADEN, 65189, GERMANY",0043-0978,,,WASSERWIRTSCHAFT,WasserWirtschaft,,2019,109,1,19,24,,
257,Fuzzy Postprocessing to Advance the Quality of Continental Seasonal Hydrological Forecasts for River Basin Management,"Streamflow forecasting services driven by seasonal meteorological forecasts from dynamic prediction systems deliver valuable information for decision-making in the water sector. Moving beyond the traditional river basin boundaries, large-scale hydrological models enable a coordinated, efficient, and harmonized anticipation and management of water-related risks (droughts, floods). However, the use of forecasts from such models at the river basin scale remains a challenge, depending on how the model reproduces the hydrological features of each particular river basin. Consequently, postprocessing of forecasts is a crucial step to ensure usefulness at the river basin scale. In this paper we present a methodology to postprocess seasonal streamflow forecasts from large-scale hydrological models and advance their quality for local applications. It consists of fuzzy logic systems that bias-adjust seasonal forecasts from a large-scale hydrological model by comparing its modeled streamflows with local observations. The methodology is demonstrated using forecasts from the pan-European hydrological model E-HYPE at the Jucar River basin (Spain). Fuzzy postprocessed forecasts are compared to postprocessed forecasts derived from a quantile mapping approach as a benchmark. Fuzzy postprocessing was able to provide skillful streamflow forecasts for the Jucar River basin, keeping most of the skill of raw E-HYPE forecasts and also outperforming quantile-mapping-based forecasts. The proposed methodology offers an efficient one-to-one mapping between large-scale modeled streamflows and basin-scale observations preserving its temporal dependence structure and can adapt its input set to increase the skill of postprocessed forecasts.",https://doi.org/10.1175/JHM-D-19-0266.1,10.1175/JHM-D-19-0266.1,"Macian-Sorribes, Hector; Pechlivanidis, Ilias; Crochemore, Louise; Pulido-Velazquez, Manuel",JOURNAL OF HYDROMETEOROLOGY,Seasonal forecasting; Hydrologic models; Mesoscale models,RESERVOIR OPERATION; DECISION-MAKING; MODEL; SYSTEM; STREAMFLOW; ENSEMBLE; PREDICTIONS; RULES; SKILL,,AMER METEOROLOGICAL SOC,BOSTON,"45 BEACON ST, BOSTON, MA 02108-3693 USA",1525-755X,1525-7541,,J HYDROMETEOROL,J.

258,Hydrological and hydraulic model for flood forecasting in Rwanda,"This paper aims to forecast the Nyabugogo River flood risk and to propose mitigation measures that can reduce flood impacts using hydrological and hydraulic models. The annual Nyabugogo River floods that have led to human and economic losses are mainly due to the high topography, rainfall, soil texture and urbanization. It was found that the medium to high flood vulnerability is located in cropland, open grassland, open shrubland, settlement, sparse forest and wetlands. The results for 10-, 30- 50- and 100-year return periods show a slight increase in the flood inundation area and in water depth. The simulation shows that the 100-year return period gives a water depth of 3.24 m. Therefore, flood mitigation measures are needed, which can include the construction reservoirs upstream, relocation of infrastructures within the flood plain area, buffer zoning around the river, rainwater harvesting and raising public awareness. This paper provides basic support for decision-makers and can help in land use planning and flood management within the basin.",https://doi.org/10.1007/s40808-021-01146-z,10.1007/s40808-021-01146-z,"Icyimpaye, Gisele; Abdelbaki, Cherifa; Mourad, Khaldoon A.",MODELING EARTH SYSTEMS AND ENVIRONMENT,Flood risk; Modelling; HEC-RAS; HEC-HMS; Nyabugogo River Basin,,,SPRINGER HEIDELBERG,HEIDELBERG,"TIERGARTENSTRASSE 17, D-69121 HEIDELBERG, GERMANY",2363-6203,2363-6211,,MODEL EARTH SYST ENV,Model.

259,Decomposition ensemble model based on variational mode decomposition and long short-term memory for streamflow forecasting,"Reliable and accurate streamflow forecasting is vital for water resource management. Many streamflow prediction studies have demonstrated the excellent prediction ability of decomposition ensemble models. Several studies first extracted subsignals from a streamflow series and then split subsignals into training and validation sets to build prediction models, capturing some future information not available in practical streamflow forecasting. Alternatively, dividing a time series into training and validation sets first and later decomposing them into subsignals can expose the subsignals to the boundary effect, making predicting streamflow difficult. Furthermore, building one model for each subsignal is laborious and can cause error accumulation. Therefore, establishing a robust and efficient decomposition ensemble model without future information to predict highly nonstationary and nonlinear streamflow is challenging. Hence, a single-model forecasting (SF) scheme that assesses the validation distribution during the training stage to adapt to the boundary effect was designed. A SF scheme based on variational mode decomposition (VMD) and long short-term memory (LSTM), namely, SF-VMD-LSTM, was proposed to predict daily streamflow 1-7 days ahead. Non-decomposition-based and decomposition-ensemble-based LSTM models established using SF, multi-model ensemble forecasting (MEF) and SF with the most influential subsignals (SFMIS) and the ensemble empirical mode decomposition (EEMD) and discrete wavelet transform (DWT) were compared. Additionally, multi-model ensemble hindcasting (MEH), single-model hindcasting (SH) and SH with the most influential subsignals (SHMIS) were used as benchmarks to evaluate the forecasting schemes' adaptability to the boundary effect. Two daily streamflow series from Han River and Jing River, China, were investigated. The results indicate that (1) SF is more robust and efficient than MEF and SFMIS; (2) VMD performs better than EEMD and DWT; (3) SF-VMD-LSTM, with NSE values larger than 0.8 for almost all the prediction scenarios, outperformed other comparative models. Therefore, SF-VMD-LSTM is robust and efficient for forecasting highly nonstationary and nonlinear streamflow.",https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jhydrol.2020.124776,10.1016/j.jhydrol.2020.124776,"Zuo, Ganggang; Luo, Jungang; Wang, Ni; Lian, Yani; He, Xinxin",JOURNAL OF HYDROLOGY,Forecasting experiment; Hindcasting experiment; Decomposition and ensemble; Deep learning,ARTIFICIAL NEURAL-NETWORK; INCORRECT USAGE; HYBRID MODELS; RIVER FLOW; PREDICTION; WAVELET; RUNOFF; WATER; MACHINE; INFLOW,,ELSEVIER,AMSTERDAM,"RADARWEG 29, 1043 NX AMSTERDAM, NETHERLANDS",0022-1694,1879-2707,,J HYDROL,J.

260,"Projected warming portends seasonal shifts of stream temperatures in the Crown of the Continent Ecosystem, USA and Canada","Climate warming is expected to increase stream temperatures in mountainous regions of western North America, yet the degree to which future climate change may influence seasonal patterns of stream temperature is uncertain. In this study, a spatially explicit statistical model framework was integrated with empirical stream temperature data (approximately four million bi-hourly recordings) and high-resolution climate and land surface data to estimate monthly stream temperatures and potential change under future climate scenarios in the Crown of the Continent Ecosystem, USA and Canada (72,000 km(2)). Moderate and extreme warming scenarios forecast increasing stream temperatures during spring, summer, and fall, with the largest increases predicted during summer (July, August, and September). Additionally, thermal regimes characteristic of current August temperatures, the warmest month of the year, may be exceeded during July and September, suggesting an earlier onset and extended duration of warm summer stream temperatures. Models estimate that the largest magnitude of temperature warming relative to current conditions may be observed during the shoulder months of winter (April and November). Summer stream temperature warming is likely to be most pronounced in glacial-fed streams where models predict the largest magnitude (> 50%) of change due to the loss of alpine glaciers. We provide the first broad-scale analysis of seasonal climate effects on spatiotemporal patterns of stream temperature in the Crown of the Continent Ecosystem for better understanding climate change impacts on freshwater habitats and guiding conservation and climate adaptation strategies.",https://doi.org/10.1007/s10584-017-2060-7,10.1007/s10584-017-2060-7,"Jones, Leslie A.; Muhlfeld, Clint C.; Marshall, Lucy A.",CLIMATIC CHANGE,,CLIMATE-CHANGE; IMPACTS; SALMON; ORGANISMS; WILDFIRE; TROUT; MODEL,,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0165-0009,1573-1480,,CLIMATIC CHANGE,Clim.

261,Probabilistic Projections of Multidimensional Flood Risks at a Convection-Permitting Scale,"Understanding future river flood risk is a prerequisite for developing climate change adaptation strategies and enhancing disaster resilience. Previous flood risk assessments can barely take into account future changes of fine-scale hydroclimatic characteristics and hardly quantify multivariate interactions among flood variables, thereby resulting in an unreliable assessment of flood risk. In this study, for the first time, we develop probabilistic projections of multidimensional river flood risks at a convection-permitting scale through the Weather Research and Forecasting (WRF) climate simulations with 4-km horizontal grid spacing. Vine copula has been widely used to assess the multidimensional dependence structure of hydroclimate variables, but the commonly used frequentist approach may fail to identify the correct vine model and to obtain the uncertainty interval. Thus, a Bayesian vine copula approach is proposed to explicitly address the multidimensional dependence of flood characteristics (i.e., flood peak, volume, and duration) and underlying uncertainties. The proposed approach enables a robust assessment of return periods of future floods for Guadalupe and Mission river basins located in South Texas of the United States. Our findings reveal that the South Texas region is projected to experience more flood events with longer duration and greater discharge volume. The flood peak, however, will not necessarily increase even though precipitation extremes are expected to become more frequent. The projected flood return periods over the Guadalupe river basin do not show an obvious increase while the Mission river basin is projected to face a dramatic increase in flood risk with exposed to 100-year and even severer floods nearly every 2 years, on average, when considering the combined effects of flood peak, volume, and duration.",https://doi.org/10.1029/2020WR028582,10.1029/2020WR028582,"Zhang, B.; Wang, S.; Wang, Y.",WATER RESOURCES RESEARCH,,PAIR-COPULA CONSTRUCTIONS; BAYESIAN MODEL SELECTION; CLIMATE-CHANGE; STATIONARITY; FRAMEWORK; ROBUSTNESS; PREDICTION; DEPENDENCE; STREAMFLOW; SCENARIOS,,AMER GEOPHYSICAL UNION,WASHINGTON,"2000 FLORIDA AVE NW, WASHINGTON, DC 20009 USA",0043-1397,1944-7973,,WATER RESOUR RES,Water Resour.

262,"Potential application of hydrological ensemble prediction in forecasting floods and its components over the Yarlung Zangbo River basin, China","In recent year, floods becomes a serious issue in the Tibetan Plateau (TP) due to climate change. Many studies have shown that ensemble flood forecasting based on numerical weather predictions can provide an early warning with extended lead time. However, the role of hydrological ensemble prediction in forecasting flood volume and its components over the Yarlung Zangbo River (YZR) basin, China, has not been investigated. This study adopts the variable infiltration capacity (VIC) model to forecast the annual maximum floods and annual first floods in the YZR based on precipitation and the maximum and minimum temperature from the European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts (ECMWF). N simulations are proposed to account for parameter uncertainty in VIC. Results show that when trade-offs between multiple objectives are significant, N simulations are recommended for better simulation and forecasting. This is why better results are obtained for the Nugesha and Yangcun stations. Our ensemble flood forecasting system can skillfully predict the maximum floods with a lead time of more than 10 d and can predict about 7 d ahead for meltwater-related components. The accuracy of forecasts for the first floods is inferior, with a lead time of only 5 d. The base-flow components for the first floods are insensitive to lead time, except at the Nuxia station, whilst for the maximum floods an obvious deterioration in performance with lead time can be recognized. The meltwater-induced surface runoff is the most poorly captured component by the forecast system, and the well-predicted rainfall-related components are the major contributor to good performance. The performance in 7 d accumulated flood volumes is better than the peak flows.",https://doi.org/10.5194/hess-23-3335-2019,10.5194/hess-23-3335-2019,"Liu, Li; Xu, Yue Ping; Pan, Su Li; Bai, Zhi Xu",HYDROLOGY AND EARTH SYSTEM SCIENCES,,RAINFALL-RUNOFF MODEL; GLOBAL CLIMATE MODELS; TIBETAN PLATEAU; MULTIOBJECTIVE CALIBRATION; STREAMFLOW PREDICTION; SPATIAL VARIABILITY; GLACIER MELT; LAND-COVER; SNOW; PRECIPITATION,,COPERNICUS GESELLSCHAFT MBH,GOTTINGEN,"BAHNHOFSALLEE 1E, GOTTINGEN, 37081, GERMANY",1027-5606,1607-7938,,HYDROL EARTH SYST SC,Hydrol.

263,"Bringing statistical learning machines together for hydro-climatological predictions - Case study for Sacramento San joaquin River Basin, California","Study region: Sacramento San Joaquin River Basin, California Study focus: The study forecasts the streamflow at a regional scale within SSJ river basin with largescale climate variables. The proposed approach eliminates the bias resulting from predefined indices at regional scale. The study was performed for eight unimpaired streamflow stations from 1962-2016. First, the Singular Valued Decomposition (SVD) teleconnections of the streamflow corresponding to 500 mbar geopotential height, sea surface temperature, 500 mbar specific humidity (SHUM500), and 500 mbar U-wind (U-500) were obtained. Second, the skillful SVD teleconnections were screened non-parametrically. Finally, the screened teleconnections were used as the streamflow predictors in the non-linear regression models (K-nearest neighbor regression and data-driven support vector machine). New hydrological insights: The SVD results identified new spatial regions that have not been included in existing predefined indices. The nonparametric model indicated the teleconnections of SHUM500 and U-500 being better streamflow predictors compared to other climate variables. The regression models were capable to apprehend most of the sustained low flows, proving the model to be effective for drought-affected regions. It was also observed that the proposed approach showed better forecasting skills with preprocessed large scale climate variables rather than using the predefined indices. The proposed study is simple, yet robust in providing qualitative streamflow forecasts that may assist water managers in making policy-related decisions when planning and managing watersheds.",https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ejrh.2019.100651,10.1016/j.ejrh.2019.100651,"Thakur, Balbhadra; Kalra, Ajay; Ahmad, Sajjad; Lamb, Kenneth W.; Lakshmi, Venkat",JOURNAL OF HYDROLOGY-REGIONAL STUDIES,Streamflow; Forecast; Climate variability; SVD; SVM; KNN; Teleconnections,SUPPORT VECTOR MACHINES; CLIMATE-CHANGE; SIERRA-NEVADA; VARIABILITY; RAINFALL; PACIFIC; PRECIPITATION; TEMPERATURE; BOOTSTRAP; PATTERNS,,ELSEVIER,AMSTERDAM,"RADARWEG 29, 1043 NX AMSTERDAM, NETHERLANDS",,2214-5818,,J HYDROL-REG STUD,J.

264,Applications of IoT and Artificial Intelligence in Water Quality Monitoring and Prediction: A Review,"Currently, internet of things (IoT) devices like environmental sensors are used to capture real-time data that can be viewed and interpreted via a visual format supported by a server computer. However, to facilitate modeling and forecasting, artificial intelligence (AI) techniques are effective in statistically analyzing complex non-linear systems and a large amount of historical data series within a short period. This present review article covers selected research journals published from 2014 to 2020. The findings from previous research indicate that despite the limitations of artificial neural network (ANN) tools, ANN has proved to be useful and powerful techniques that can be used in the field of hydrology. Similarly, ANN tools have the ability to evaluate historical data collected from different river stations and wastewater treatment plants with minimum errors within a short time. Therefore, based on the selected past literature used for this review we found that different types of ANN algorithm such as feed-forward backpropagation (FFBP) algorithm, gradient descent, Broyden-Fletcher-Goldfarb-Shanno (BFGS), conjugate gradient, radial basis function neural networks (RBFNN), neural network fitting (NNF), cascade forward back propagation (CFBP), ensemble ANN (EANN) and single AAN (SANN) have been employed in the prediction and monitoring of water quality parameters with satisfactory outcome. Furthermore, modeling alongside forecasting of water quality parameters would act as a big leap for government agencies and independent organisations in monitoring, decision making and regulating waste discharged into natural water bodies in order to achieve a safe and improved water quality for users.",https://doi.org/10.1109/ICICT50816.2021.9358675,10.1109/ICICT50816.2021.9358675,"Mustafa, Hauwa Mohammed; Mustapha, Aisha; Hayder, Gasim; Salisu, Abdullahi",PROCEEDINGS OF THE 6TH INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE ON INVENTIVE COMPUTATION TECHNOLOGIES (ICICT 2021),pollutant; sediment load; machine learning tool; ANN; discharge prediction,NEURAL-NETWORK; FUZZY-LOGIC; RIVER; MODEL; DEMAND,,IEEE,NEW YORK,"345 E 47TH ST, NEW YORK, NY 10017 USA",,,978-1-7281-8501-9,,,,2021,,,968,975,,
265,Novel satellite based analytical model developed to predict microalgae yields in open pond raceway systems and applied to Canadian sites,"Interest in microalgae cultivation continues to increase based on its potential commercial value. Algae converts CO2, nitrates, phosphates and other nutrients into a biomass that can be processed into biofuels, pharmaceuticals, nutraceuticals, food, fertilizers, and other active compounds. Solar irradiance and media temperatures are key parameters in determining microalgae cultivation yield and hence these parameters are fundamental in existing models that have been constructed to predict yields in different locations for open pond raceway (OPR) cultivation systems. The challenge in estimating OPR yields in higher and lower latitudes (colder climates) is that there are no known attempts to cultivate algae at any scale in these regions, nor are there data sets that include shallow pond site-specific daily water temperature measurements, from which to construct algae cultivation models. To address these challenges, our research introduces a new data-intensive analytical SATOPR (SATellite Open Pond Raceway) model, relying on ubiquitous historical satellite data. Local solar irradiance and ambient temperature values which are used to predict microalgae production yields at any geographic location including the colder latitudes of central Alberta and the Northwest Territories in Canada. The model predicts that annual open pond algae cultivation to produce 1000 T biomass would require 17-20 ha at Mesa, AZ, 45-56 ha at Medicine Hat, AB, 57-68 ha at Fort Saskatchewan, AB and 71-80 ha at Great Slave Lake, NWT. The Mesa, AZ results are more conservative than forecast by a NREL model predicting 12 ha to produce 1000 T biomass. Modeled land area information provides the basis for life cycle assessments (LCAs), techno-economic analyses (TEAs), and photobioreactor (PBR) versus OPR performance studies, yields simulations based on various parameters, and can assist with algae production platform optimization.",https://doi.org/10.1016/j.algal.2019.101431,10.1016/j.algal.2019.101431,"Pankratz, Stan; Oyedun, Adetoyese Olajire; Kumar, Amit",ALGAL RESEARCH-BIOMASS BIOFUELS AND BIOPRODUCTS,Microalgae cultivation; Algae biomass yield; Solar irradiance; Predictive model; Canada,MUNICIPAL WASTE-WATER; BIOFUEL PRODUCTION; ALGAL BIOMASS; FRESH-WATER; GROWTH-RATE; LIGHT; TEMPERATURE; CULTIVATION; BIODIESEL; PRODUCTIVITY,,ELSEVIER,AMSTERDAM,"RADARWEG 29, 1043 NX AMSTERDAM, NETHERLANDS",2211-9264,,,ALGAL RES,Algal Res.,MAY,2019,39,,,,101431,

Spatiotemporal variations of water quality and their inherent constraints make it very complex. This study explored a data-based method for short-term water quality forecasting. Prediction of water quality indicators including dissolved oxygen, chemical oxygen demand by KMnO4 and ammonia nitrogen using support vector machine was taken as inputs of the particle swarm algorithm based optimal wavelet neural network to forecast the whole status index of water quality. Gubeikou monitoring section of Miyun reservoir in Beijing, China was taken as the study case to examine effectiveness of this approach. The experiment results also revealed that the proposed model has advantages of stability and time reduction in comparison with other data-driven models including traditional BP neural network model, wavelet neural network model and Gradient Boosting Decision Tree model.

267,Improving the Reliability of Sub-Seasonal Forecasts of High and Low Flows by Using a Flow-Dependent Nonparametric Model,"Sub-seasonal streamflow forecasts are important for a range of water resource management applications, with a distinct practical interest in forecasts of high flows (e.g., for managing flood events) and low flows (e.g., for managing environmental flows). Despite this interest, differences in forecast performance for high and low flow events are not routinely investigated. Our study reveals that while forecasts evaluated over the full flow range can appear reliable, stratification into high/low flow ranges highlights significant under/over-estimation of forecast uncertainty, respectively. We overcome this challenge by introducing a flow-dependent (FD) nonparametric component into a post-processing model of hydrological forecasting errors, the Multi-Temporal Hydrological Residual Error (MuTHRE) model, yielding the MuTHRE-FD model. The MuTHRE and MuTHRE-FD models are compared in a case study with 11 Australian catchments, the GR4J rainfall-runoff model and post-processed rainfall forecasts from ACCESS-S. Through its improved treatment of flow-dependence, the MuTHRE-FD model achieves practically significant improvements over the original MuTHRE model in the reliability of forecasted cumulative volumes for: (a) high flows out to 7 days; (b) low flows out to 2 days; and (c) mid flows for majority of lead times. The new MuTHRE-FD model provides seamless sub-seasonal forecasts with high quality performance for both high and low flows over a range of lead times. This improvement provides forecast users with increased confidence in using sub-seasonal forecasts across a wide range of applications.",https://doi.org/10.1029/2020WR029317,10.1029/2020WR029317,"McInerney, David; Thyer, Mark; Kavetski, Dmitri; Laugesen, Richard; Woldemeskel, Fitsum; Tuteja, Narendra; Kuczera, George",WATER RESOURCES RESEARCH,Sub-seasonal streamflow forecasts; residual error model; innovations; flow dependence; streamflow post-processing,STREAMFLOW; PREDICTION; AUTOCORRELATION; INFERENCE; JOINT,,AMER GEOPHYSICAL UNION,WASHINGTON,"2000 FLORIDA AVE NW, WASHINGTON, DC 20009 USA",0043-1397,1944-7973,,WATER RESOUR RES,Water Resour.

268,Integration and Evaluation of Forecast-Informed Multiobjective Reservoir Operations,"Incorporating streamflow forecasts into reservoir operations can improve water resources management efficiency, yet the forecast value in multipurpose reservoir systems is rarely investigated, let alone the relationship between forecast accuracy and value in multiobjective reservoir operation. Here, we propose a forecast-informed framework to derive multiobjective operating rules based on radial basis functions and the Pareto archived dynamically dimensioned search optimization algorithm and subsequently develop indicators reflective of Pareto fronts with and without forecast information to characterize forecast value. Based on a case study of the Hanjiang cascade of reservoirs in the Yangtze River Basin, China, the optimal inclusion of streamflow forecasts notably improves the performance of multiobjective reservoir operations, mainly by significantly increasing the hydropower generation. The relationship between forecast accuracy and value is explored by comparing four accuracy indicators (Nash-Sutcliffe efficiency, mutual information, correlation coefficient, and Kullback-Leibler distance) and forecast value. The correlation coefficient is found to be the most suitable forecast indicator given its high correlation with forecast value and stability in the regression. For multiobjective forecast-informed reservoir systems, it is critical to understand and define the relationship between forecast accuracy and forecast value; if improvements in accuracy lead to steep gains in value, investing in further forecast model development may be warranted.",https://doi.org/10.1061/(ASCE)WR.1943-5452.0001229,10.1061/(ASCE)WR.1943-5452.0001229,"Yang, Guang; Guo, Shenglian; Liu, Pan; Block, Paul",JOURNAL OF WATER RESOURCES PLANNING AND MANAGEMENT,Reservoir operation; Radial basis functions; Forecast-informed reservoir operating rules; Forecast value; Multiobjective optimization,PREDICTION; SELECTION; SYSTEMS; OPTIMIZATION; INFORMATION; MANAGEMENT; LIMITS; RULES,,ASCE-AMER SOC CIVIL ENGINEERS,RESTON,"1801 ALEXANDER BELL DR, RESTON, VA 20191-4400 USA",0733-9496,1943-5452,,J WATER RES PLAN MAN,J.

To evaluate the effectiveness of alternative data-driven and process-based methods, flow forecasts at a case study site (River Dove, UK) using (1) a probability-distributed rainfall-runoff model (PDM), (2) PDM coupled with an autoregressive integrated moving average (ARIMA) error predictor, and (3) a long short-term memory (LSTM) neural network are integrated into a water resources management model coupled with genetic algorithm optimization to simulate and compare water abstractions, reservoir storage, downstream river flows, and pumping energy costs. When compared to historical data, results show that both PDM plus ARIMA and LSTM forecasts led to improved water abstraction operations, i.e., increased water abstraction volumes during dry periods while maintaining river environmental flows, as well as reduced pumping costs. Cost savings were found to be sensitive to the accuracy of the forecasting technique only within specific flow ranges.

270,Variability in spatial-temporal recharge under the observed and projected climate: A site-specific simulation in the black soil region of Russia,"The main purpose of this work is to evaluate diffuse groundwater recharge and its temporal dynamics at sites with different landscapes and soil profiles under observed and projected climate variability. Three typical sites with different landscapes and topsoil profiles were chosen for the field study. Field work consisted of pit development and soil sample collection for laboratory study using the centrifuge method. Soil hydraulic parameters were obtained by the RETC code using the observed values of volumetric water content vs. pressure head. HYDRUS-1D code was used to estimate groundwater recharge based on a 70-year (1945-2015) meteorological dataset with daily resolution (including values of precipitation, air temperature, wind speed, and humidity). This dataset was preprocessed using our SURFBAL code to calculate the surface and topsoil water and energy balance. Retrospective historical simulation results showed that there was a considerable variation in the mean annual groundwater recharge values (49-104 mm/year) for the three studied profiles. The temporal change in groundwater recharge occurred relatively synchronously at all sites and was governed by the change in the current annual aridity index. The results of this historical simulation did not reveal any traces of climate change in the groundwater recharge of the studied region in the last 30-40 years. To predict the recharge variations in the second half of the 21st century, the LARSWG forecast weather generator with the climate projections of the 5th General Circulation Models (GCMs) from the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project 5 (CMIP5) family was used. On average in the case of climate development under the maximum greenhouse gas emissions RCP8.5 scenario, there will be a reduction in groundwater recharge in the studied region in 2060-2080, caused by two factors: change of aridity index, which determines evapotranspiration during a warm season and the accumulation of snow and subsequent meltwater infiltration during the snowmelt periods.",https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jhydrol.2020.125247,10.1016/j.jhydrol.2020.125247,"Pozdniakov, Sergey P.; Vasilevsky, Peter Yu; Grinevskiy, Sergey O.; Lekhov, Vladimir A.; Sizov, Nikolay E.; Wang, Ping",JOURNAL OF HYDROLOGY,Recharge; Black soil; Climate change; Historical simulation; Projected simulation; General Circulation Models,GROUNDWATER RECHARGE; HYDRAULIC CONDUCTIVITY; MODEL; EVAPOTRANSPIRATION; DISCHARGE,,ELSEVIER,AMSTERDAM,"RADARWEG 29, 1043 NX AMSTERDAM, NETHERLANDS",0022-1694,1879-2707,,J HYDROL,J.

271,CDLSTM: A Novel Model for Climate Change Forecasting,"Water received in rainfall is a crucial natural resource for agricul-ture, the hydrological cycle, and municipal purposes. The changing rainfall pattern is an essential aspect of assessing the impact of climate change on water resources planning and management. Climate change affected the entire world, specifically India's fragile Himalayan mountain region, which has high significance due to being a climatic indicator. The water coming from Himalayan rivers is essential for 1.4 billion people living downstream. Earlier studies either modeled temperature or rainfall for the Himalayan area; however, the combined influence of both in a long-term analysis was not performed utilizing Deep Learning (DL). The present investigation attempted to analyze the time series and correlation of temperature (1796-2013) and rainfall changes (1901-2015) over the Himalayan states in India. The Climate Deep Long Short-Term Memory (CDLSTM) model was developed and optimized to forecast all Himalayan states' temperature and rainfall values. Facebook's Prophet (FB-Prophet) model was implemented to forecast and assess the performance of the developed CDLSTM model. The performance of both models was assessed based on various performance metrics and shown significantly higher accuracies and low error rates.",https://doi.org/10.32604/cmc.2022.023059,10.32604/cmc.2022.023059,"Haq, Mohd Anul",CMC-COMPUTERS MATERIALS & CONTINUA,Himalayas; climate change; cdlstm; facebook; temperature; rainfall,RAINFALL; PREDICTION; THICKNESS,,TECH SCIENCE PRESS,HENDERSON,"871 CORONADO CENTER DR, SUTE 200, HENDERSON, NV 89052 USA",1546-2218,1546-2226,,CMC-COMPUT MATER CON,CMC-Comput.

272,Groundwater level prediction of Varanasi wells during pre-monsoon and post-monsoon using intelligence approach,"In general, groundwater management is a significant role in meeting water needs in society. However, the growing demand for groundwater must meet the needs of an enormous community to sustain the severe effects of limited water resources. Therefore, the groundwater level (GWL) should be analyzed for efficient groundwater management to identify groundwater usages. However, predicting the GWL is a challenging task in water resource management because of large complex data. So, this research has proposed generalized intelligence control with hybrid ant colony African buffalo optimization (GIC with HAC-ABO) approach to forecast the GWL in alluvial aquifers at Varanasi City. Initially, the well locations at Varanasi, Uttar Pradesh, are identified with the use of differential global positioning system (DGPS). Subsequently, the GWL in the well for post-monsoon and pre-monsoon is measured using a graduated steel tape. Then the fitness value of HAC-ABO in GIC was updated to predict the GWL in Varanasi wells. Here, the proposed technique has analyzed the GWL for both pre-monsoon and post-monsoon for every year and also predicts the future GWL in Varanasi well after 30 years. Henceforth, this approach has provided better results in the grounds of prediction accuracy, correlation coefficient, root mean square error (RMSE), and mean absolute error (MAE) compared to other approaches.",https://doi.org/10.1007/s12517-021-08875-6,10.1007/s12517-021-08875-6,"Shekhar, Shiwanshu; Jha, Medha",ARABIAN JOURNAL OF GEOSCIENCES,Groundwater; Neural network; Rainfall; Pre-monsoon; Post-monsoon; Varanasi City; Aquifer,WATER-RESOURCES; UTTAR-PRADESH; OPTIMIZATION; STRATEGIES; ISFAHAN; AQUIFER; QUALITY; GIS,,SPRINGER HEIDELBERG,HEIDELBERG,"TIERGARTENSTRASSE 17, D-69121 HEIDELBERG, GERMANY",1866-7511,1866-7538,,ARAB J GEOSCI,Arab.

273,"Performance Assessment of the Linear, Nonlinear and Nonparametric Data Driven Models in River Flow Forecasting","In recent years, the data-driven modeling techniques have gained more attention in hydrology and water resources studies. River runoff estimation and forecasting are one of the research fields that these techniques have several applications in them. In the current study, four common data-driven modeling techniques including multiple linear regression, K-nearest neighbors, artificial neural networks and adaptive neuro-fuzzy inference systems have been used to form runoff forecasting models and then their results have been evaluated. Also, effects of using of some different scenarios for selecting predictor variables have been studied. It is evident from the results that using flow data of one or two month ago in the predictor variables dataset can improve accuracy of results. In addition, comparison of general performances of the modeling techniques shows superiority of results of KNN models among the studied models. Among selected models of the different techniques, the selected KNN model presented best performance with a linear correlation coefficient equal to 0.84 between observed flow data and predicted values and a RMSE equal to 2.64.",https://doi.org/10.1007/s11269-017-1792-5,10.1007/s11269-017-1792-5,"Ahani, Ali; Shourian, Mojtaba; Rad, Peiman Rahimi",WATER RESOURCES MANAGEMENT,River flow forecasting; Data driven modeling; MLR; KNN; ANN; ANFIS,ARTIFICIAL NEURAL-NETWORKS; HYDROLOGIC TIME-SERIES; PREDICTIVE CAPABILITIES; RUNOFF; FUZZY; SIMULATION; NEIGHBORS,,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0920-4741,1573-1650,,WATER RESOUR MANAG,Water Resour.

274,Developing Subseasonal to Seasonal Climate Forecast Products for Hydrology and Water Management,"We describe a new effort to enhance climate forecast relevance and usability through the development of a system for evaluating and displaying real-time subseasonal to seasonal (S2S) climate forecasts on a watershed scale. Water managers may not use climate forecasts to their full potential due to perceived low skill, mismatched spatial and temporal resolutions, or lack of knowledge or tools to ingest data. Most forecasts are disseminated as large-domain maps or gridded datasets and may be systematically biased relative to watershed climatologies. Forecasts presented on a watershed scale allow water managers to view forecasts for their specific basins, thereby increasing the usability and relevance of climate forecasts. This paper describes the formulation of S2S climate forecast products based on the Climate Forecast System version 2 (CFSv2) and the North American Multi-Model Ensemble (NMME). Forecast products include bi-weekly CFSv2 forecasts, and monthly and seasonal NMME forecasts. Precipitation and temperature forecasts are aggregated spatially to a United States Geological Survey (USGS) hydrologic unit code 4 (HUC-4) watershed scale. Forecast verification reveals appreciable skill in the first two bi-weekly periods (Weeks 1-2 and 2-3) from CFSv2, and usable skill in NMME Month 1 forecast with varying skills at longer lead times dependent on the season. Application of a bias-correction technique (quantile mapping) eliminates forecast bias in the CFSv2 reforecasts, without adding significantly to correlation skill.",https://doi.org/10.1111/1752-1688.12746,10.1111/1752-1688.12746,"Baker, Sarah A.; Wood, Andrew W.; Rajagopalan, Balaji",JOURNAL OF THE AMERICAN WATER RESOURCES ASSOCIATION,watershed management; geospatial analysis; subseasonal to seasonal; climate forecasts; CFSv2; NMME; precipitation; temperature,AMERICAN MULTIMODEL ENSEMBLE; SKILL; PREDICTION; SYSTEM; PRECIPITATION; RATIONALE; SUCCESS,,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",1093-474X,1752-1688,,J AM WATER RESOUR AS,J.

275,Short Term Optimal Operation of Water Supply Reservoir under Flood Control Stress using Model Predictive Control,"Reservoir operations require enhanced operating procedures for water systems under stress attributed to growing water demand and consequences of changing hydro-climatic conditions. This study focuses on the management of the Yuvacik Dam Reservoir for water supply and flood mitigation in the Marmara Region of Turkey. We present an improved operating technique for fulfilling the conflicting water supply and flood mitigation objectives. This is accomplished by incorporating the long term water supply objectives into a Guide Curve (GC) whereas the extreme floods are attenuated by means of short-term optimization based on Model Predictive Control (MPC). The reference case implements operating rules with a constant GC at maximum forebay elevation targeting the fulfillment of the water supply objective. We compare the reference with a new time-dependent GC, derived using an Implicit Stochastic Optimization (ISO) approach. This new curve shows nearly the same performance regarding the water supply objectives, but significantly reduces the flooding risk downstream of the dam. Possible flood events observed at the end of the wet season, when the reservoir is at the maximum level to enable water supply for the dry season, can be eliminated by the application of an additional short-term optimization by MPC. The robustness of the approach is demonstrated via hindcasting experiments.",https://doi.org/10.1007/s11269-017-1828-x,10.1007/s11269-017-1828-x,"Uysal, Goekcen; Schwanenberg, Dirk; Alvarado-Montero, Rodolfo; Sensoy, Aynur",WATER RESOURCES MANAGEMENT,Reservoir operation; Optimization; Simulation; Water supply; Flood mitigation; Model Predictive Control,OPTIMAL-DESIGN; LEVEL; MANAGEMENT; BASIN,,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0920-4741,1573-1650,,WATER RESOUR MANAG,Water Resour.

Data-driven model predictions using deep learning algorithms are promising for these purposes. Echo state network (ESN) and Deep Echo state network (DeepESN), referred to as Reservoir Computing (RC), are effective and speedy algorithms to process a large amount of data. In this study, we used the ESN and the DeepESN algorithms to analyze the meteorological hourly data from 2002 to 2014 at the Tainan Observatory in the southern Taiwan. The results show that the correlation coefficient by using the DeepESN was better than that by using the ESN and commercial neuronal network algorithms (Back-propagation network (BPN) and support vector regression (SVR), MATLAB, The MathWorks co.), and the accuracy of predicted rainfall by using the DeepESN can be significantly improved compared with those by using ESN, the BPN and the SVR. In sum, the DeepESN is a trustworthy and good method to predict rainfall; it could be applied to global climate forecasts which need high-volume data processing.",https://doi.org/10.1038/s41598-019-49242-6,10.1038/s41598-019-49242-6,"Yen, Meng-Hua; Liu, Ding-Wei; Hsin, Yi-Chia; Lin, Chu-En; Chen, Chii-Chang",SCIENTIFIC REPORTS,,BACKPROPAGATION NEURAL-NETWORK; TYPHOON RAINFALL; CLIMATOLOGY; MACHINE; EVENTS; MODEL,,NATURE PORTFOLIO,BERLIN,"HEIDELBERGER PLATZ 3, BERLIN, 14197, GERMANY",2045-2322,,,SCI REP-UK,Sci Rep,SEP 4,2019,9,,,,12774,
277,Analysis of the effects of biases in ensemble streamflow prediction (ESP) forecasts on electricity production in hydropower reservoir management,"This paper presents an analysis of the effects of biased extended streamflow prediction (ESP) forecasts on three deterministic optimization techniques implemented in a simulated operational context with a rolling horizon test bed for managing a cascade of hydroelectric reservoirs and generating stations in Quebec, Canada. The observed weather data were fed to the hydrological model, and the synthetic streamflow subsequently generated was considered to be a proxy for the observed inflow. A traditional, climatology-based ESP forecast approach was used to generate ensemble streamflow scenarios, which were used by three reservoir management optimization approaches. Both positive and negative biases were then forced into the ensembles by multiplying the streamflow values by constant factors. The optimization method's response to those biases was measured through the evaluation of the average annual energy generation in a forward-rolling simulation test bed in which the entire system is precisely and accurately modelled. The ensemble climate data forecasts, the hydrological modelling and ESP forecast generation, optimization model, and decision-making process are all integrated, as is the simulation model that updates reservoir levels and computes generation at each time step. The study focussed on one hydropower system both with and without minimum baseload constraints. This study finds that the tested deterministic optimization algorithms lack the capacity to compensate for uncertainty in future inflows and therefore place the reservoir levels at greater risk to maximize short-term profit. It is shown that for this particular system, an increase in ESP forecast inflows of approximately 5% allows managing the reservoirs at optimal levels and producing the most energy on average, effectively negating the deterministic model's tendency to underestimate the risk of spilling. Finally, it is shown that implementing minimum load constraints serves as a de facto control on deterministic bias by forcing the system to draw more water from the reservoirs than what the models consider to be optimal trajectories.",https://doi.org/10.5194/hess-23-2735-2019,10.5194/hess-23-2735-2019,"Arsenault, Richard; Cote, Pascal",HYDROLOGY AND EARTH SYSTEM SCIENCES,,STOCHASTIC OPTIMIZATION; SKILL; SDP,,COPERNICUS GESELLSCHAFT MBH,GOTTINGEN,"BAHNHOFSALLEE 1E, GOTTINGEN, 37081, GERMANY",1027-5606,1607-7938,,HYDROL EARTH SYST SC,Hydrol.

278,"A survey of modeling for water quality prediction of Gharasou River, Kermanshah, Iran","Water quality models survey and predict changes in the water quality parameters with the optimized monitoring costs. The Gharasou River is the primary resource of water supply for the Karkheh River Basin (KRB), the third-greatest and most productive basin in Iran. This paper reviewed the estimation of water quality of the Gharasou River by W-ANN, QUAL2K, MPSIAC, WEPP, SWAT, SRM, AWBM, HBV, SDSM, and ANN models. The results of the QUAL2K simulation showed the rapid increases of BOD, TN, and TP in the Sahra Company site. The SRM and AWBM could simulate monthly runoff. The results also showed that the SWAT model simulated monthly runoff reasonably in some studies but weakly in another. Results indicated that W-ANN could estimate accurately EC (r = 0.996) and TDS (r = 0.999). The HBV model could simulate ETa reasonably in the KRB. The MPSIAC model estimated the erosion rates of 4.47, 16.60, and 18.57 t ha(-1) yr(-1)in the agriculture area, rangeland, and forest, respectively. The WEPP model predicted the runoff accurately especially in the slope of 25%, but under-estimated soil erosion in the slopes of 35% and 45%. SDSM and ANN models showed a significant reduction of streamflow of - 3.7 and - 9.47 m(3) s(-1), respectively. While these models predict + 0.58 and + 0.48 degrees C increases in temperature, they forecast - 0.1 and - 0.4 mm decreases in daily rainfall, respectively.

279,Benchmarking ensemble streamflow prediction skill in the UK,"Skilful hydrological forecasts at sub-seasonal to seasonal lead times would be extremely beneficial for decision-making in water resources management, hydropower operations, and agriculture, especially during drought conditions. Ensemble streamflow prediction (ESP) is a well-established method for generating an ensemble of streamflow forecasts in the absence of skilful future meteorological predictions, instead using initial hydrologic conditions (IHCs), such as soil moisture, groundwater, and snow, as the source of skill. We benchmark when and where the ESP method is skilful across a diverse sample of 314 catchments in the UK and explore the relationship between catchment storage and ESP skill. The GR4J hydrological model was forced with historic climate sequences to produce a 51-member ensemble of streamflow hindcasts. We evaluated forecast skill seamlessly from lead times of 1 day to 12 months initialized at the first of each month over a 50-year hindcast period from 1965 to 2015. Results showed ESP was skilful against a climatology benchmark forecast in the majority of catchments across all lead times up to a year ahead, but the degree of skill was strongly conditional on lead time, forecast initialization month, and individual catchment location and storage properties. UK- wide mean ESP skill decayed exponentially as a function of lead time with continuous ranked probability skill scores across the year of 0.75, 0.20, and 0.11 for 1-day, 1-month, and 3-month lead times, respectively. However, skill was not uniform across all initialization months. For lead times up to 1 month, ESP skill was higher than average when initialized in summer and lower in winter months, whereas for longer seasonal and annual lead times skill was higher when initialized in autumn and winter months and lowest in spring. ESP was most skilful in the south and east of the UK, where slower responding catchments with higher soil moisture and groundwater storage are mainly located; correlation between catchment base flow index (BFI) and ESP skill was very strong (Spearman's rank correlation coefficient = 0.90 at 1-month lead time). This was in contrast to the more highly responsive catchments in the north and west which were generally not skilful at seasonal lead times. Overall, this work provides scientific justification for when and where use of such a relatively simple forecasting approach is appropriate in the UK. This study, furthermore, creates a low cost benchmark against which potential skill improvements from more sophisticated hydro-meteorological ensemble prediction systems can be judged.",https://doi.org/10.5194/hess-22-2023-2018,10.5194/hess-22-2023-2018,"Harrigan, Shaun; Prudhomme, Christel; Parry, Simon; Smith, Katie; Tanguy, Maliko",HYDROLOGY AND EARTH SYSTEM SCIENCES,,HYDROLOGICAL MODELS; UNITED-KINGDOM; FORECAST SKILL; SIMULATION; RAINFALL; SYSTEM; BASIN; DECOMPOSITION; BRITAIN; EUROPE,,COPERNICUS GESELLSCHAFT MBH,GOTTINGEN,"BAHNHOFSALLEE 1E, GOTTINGEN, 37081, GERMANY",1027-5606,1607-7938,,HYDROL EARTH SYST SC,Hydrol.

280,Real Time Control of Rainwater Harvesting Systems: The Benefits of Increasing Rainfall Forecast Window,"Use of real time control (RTC) technology in rainwater harvesting systems can improve performance across water supply, flood protection, and environmental flow provision. Such systems make the most of rainfall forecast information, to release water prior to storm events and thus minimize uncontrolled overflows. To date, most advanced applications have adopted 24-hr forecast information, leaving longer-term forecasts largely untested. In this study, we aimed to predict the performance of four different RTC strategies, based on different forecast lead time and preferred objectives. RTC systems were predicted to yield comparatively less harvested rainwater than conventional passive systems but delivered superior performance in terms of flood mitigation and delivery of environmental water for streamflow restoration. More importantly, using a 7-day rainfall forecast was shown to enhance the ability of RTC in mitigating flood risks and delivering an outflow regime that is close to the natural (reference) streamflow. Such a finding suggests that RTC combined with 7-day forecast can enhance the functionality of rainwater harvesting systems to restore and even mimic the entire natural flow regimes in receiving streams. This also opens up a new opportunity for practitioners to implement smart technology in managing urban stormwater in a range of contexts and for a range of stream health objectives.",https://doi.org/10.1029/2020WR027856,10.1029/2020WR027856,"Xu, Wei D.; Fletcher, Tim D.; Burns, Matthew J.; Cherqui, Frederic",WATER RESOURCES RESEARCH,Rainwater Harvesting System; Real-Time Control; Numeric Weather Prediction; Environmental Flow Provision; Flood Protection; Stormwater Management,URBAN STORMWATER MANAGEMENT; PRECIPITATION FORECASTS; WATER-DISTRIBUTION; LAND-USE; URBANIZATION; MODEL; PRINCIPLES; HYDROLOGY; FRAMEWORK; DURATION,,AMER GEOPHYSICAL UNION,WASHINGTON,"2000 FLORIDA AVE NW, WASHINGTON, DC 20009 USA",0043-1397,1944-7973,,WATER RESOUR RES,Water Resour.

281,The thermal response of small and shallow lakes to climate change: new insights from 3D hindcast modelling,"Small, shallow lakes represent the majority of inland freshwater bodies. However, the effects of climate change on such ecosystems have rarely been quantitatively addressed. We propose a methodology to evaluate the thermal response of small, shallow lakes to long-term changes in the meteorological conditions through model simulations. To do so, a 3D thermal-hydrodynamic model is forced with meteorological data and used to hindcast the evolution of an urban lake in the Paris region between 1960 and 2017. Its thermal response is assessed through a series of indices describing its thermal regime in terms of water temperature, thermal stratification, and potential cyanobacteria production. These indices and the meteorological forcing are first analysed over time to test the presence of long-term monotonic trends. 3D simulations are then exploited to highlight the presence of spatial heterogeneity. The analyses show that climate change has strongly impacted the thermal regime of the study site. Its response is highly correlated with three meteorological variables: air temperature, solar radiation, and wind speed. Mean annual water temperature shows a considerable warming trend of 0.6 degrees C per decade, accompanied by longer stratification and by an increase in thermal energy favourable to cyanobacteria proliferation. The strengthening of thermal conditions favourable for cyanobacteria is particularly strong during spring and summer, while stratification increases especially during spring and autumn. The 3D analysis allows us to detect a sharp separation between deeper and shallower portions of the basin in terms of stratification dynamics and potential cyanobacteria production. This induces highly dynamic patterns in space and time within the study site that are particularly favourable to cyanobacteria growth and bloom initiation.",https://doi.org/10.5194/esd-12-439-2021,10.5194/esd-12-439-2021,"Piccioni, Francesco; Casenave, Celine; Lemaire, Bruno Jacques; Le Moigne, Patrick; Dubois, Philippe; Vincon-Leite, Brigitte",EARTH SYSTEM DYNAMICS,,GROWING DEGREE-DAYS; WATER TEMPERATURES; SURFACE TEMPERATURES; PHYTOPLANKTON; IMPACT; STRATIFICATION; CYANOBACTERIA; CONSEQUENCES; BIODIVERSITY; RESERVOIR,,COPERNICUS GESELLSCHAFT MBH,GOTTINGEN,"BAHNHOFSALLEE 1E, GOTTINGEN, 37081, GERMANY",2190-4979,2190-4987,,EARTH SYST DYNAM,Earth Syst.

282,One-Dimensional Hydrodynamic Modeling of the Euphrates River and Prediction of Hydraulic Parameters,"Forecasting techniques are essential in the planning, design, and management of water resource systems. The numerical model introduced in this study turns governing differential equations into systems of linear or non-linear equations in the flow field, thereby revealing solutions. This one-dimensional hydrodynamic model represents the varied unsteady flow found in natural channels based on the Saint-Venant Equations. The model consists of the equations for the conservation of mass and momentum, which are recognized as very powerful mathematical tools for studying an important class of water resource problems. These problems are characterized by time dependence of flow and cover a wide range of phenomena. The formulations, held up by the four-point implicit finite difference scheme, solve the nonlinear system of equations using the Newton-Raphson iteration method with a modified Gaussian elimination technique. The model is calibrated using data on the Euphrates River during the early spring flood in 2015. It is verified by its application to an ideal canal and to the reach selected at the Euphrates River; this application is also used to predict the effect of hydraulic parameters on the river's flow characteristics. A comparison between model results and field data indicates the feasibility of our technique and the accuracy of results (R-2 = 0.997), meaning that the model is ready for future application whenever field observations are available.",https://doi.org/10.28991/cej-2020-03091530,10.28991/cej-2020-03091530,"Al-Mansori, Nassrin Jassim Hussien; Al-Zubaidi, Laith Shaker Ashoor",CIVIL ENGINEERING JOURNAL-TEHRAN,Hydrodynamics; River; Surface Water; Numerical Model; Finite Element; Flow,SIMULATION; SCHEME; FLOW,,C EJ PUBLISHING GROUP,TEHRAN,"DR KAVIANPOUR OFF, 3RD FL CIVIL ENGINEERING FAC, K N TOOSI UNIV TECHNOLOGY, TEHRAN, 00000, IRAN",2676-6957,2476-3055,,CIV ENG J-TEHRAN,"Civ.

283,Hydrological Model Diversity Enhances Streamflow Forecast Skill at Short- to Medium-Range Timescales,"We investigate the ability of hydrological multimodel ensemble predictions to enhance the skill of streamflow forecasts at short- to medium-range timescales. To generate the multimodel ensembles, we implement a new statistical postprocessor, namely, quantile regression-Bayesian model averaging (QR-BMA). Quantile regression-Bayesian model averaging uses quantile regression to bias correct the ensemble streamflow forecasts from the individual models and Bayesian model averaging to optimally combine their probability density functions. Additionally, we use an information-theoretic measure, namely, conditional mutual information, to quantify the skill enhancements from the multimodel forecasts. We generate ensemble streamflow forecasts at lead times from 1 to 7days using three hydrological models: (i) Antecedent Precipitation Index-Continuous, (ii) Hydrology Laboratory-Research Distributed Hydrologic Model, and (iii) Weather Research and Forecasting Hydrological modeling system. As forcing to the hydrological models, we use weather ensemble forecasts from the National Centers for Environmental Prediction 11-member Global Ensemble Forecast System Reforecast version 2. The forecasting experiments are performed for four nested basins of the North Branch Susquehanna River, USA. We find that after bias correcting the streamflow forecasts from each model, their skill performance becomes comparable. We find that the multimodel ensemble forecasts have higher skill than the best single-model forecasts. Furthermore, the skill enhancements obtained by the multimodel ensemble forecasts are found to be dominated by model diversity, rather than by increased ensemble size alone. This result, obtained using conditional mutual information, indicates that each hydrological model contributes additional information to enhance forecast skill. Overall, our results highlight benefits of hydrological multimodel forecasting for improving streamflow predictions.",https://doi.org/10.1029/2018WR023197,10.1029/2018WR023197,"Sharma, Sanjib; Siddique, Ridwan; Reed, Seann; Ahnert, Peter; Mejia, Alfonso",WATER RESOURCES RESEARCH,,COMBINING PREDICTIVE SCHEMES; TO-INTERANNUAL PREDICTION; ENSEMBLE FORECASTS; INTERCOMPARISON PROJECT; DATA ASSIMILATION; DAILY TEMPERATURE; ATLANTIC REGION; NEW-YORK; PRECIPITATION; SYSTEM,,AMER GEOPHYSICAL UNION,WASHINGTON,"2000 FLORIDA AVE NW, WASHINGTON, DC 20009 USA",0043-1397,1944-7973,,WATER RESOUR RES,Water Resour.

284,A hybrid neural network-based technique to improve the flow forecasting of physical and data-driven models: Methodology and case studies in Andean watersheds,"Study region: The present study was conducted in the Machangara Alto and Chulco rivers, which belong to the Paute basin in the provinces of Azuay and Canar in southern Ecuador. Study focus: Andean watersheds are important providers of water supply for human consumption, food supply, energy generation, industrial water use, and ecosystem services and functions for many cities in Ecuador and in the rest of South America. In these regions, accurate quantification and prediction of water flow is challenging, mainly due to significant climatic variability and sparse monitoring networks. In the context of flow forecasting, this work evaluates the accuracy of two physical models (WEAP and GR2M) and two models based on artificial neural networks (ANN) that use meteorological data as input variables. Then, a hybrid technique is proposed, using the time series generated by the individual models as inputs of a new ANN. This approach aims to increase the accuracy of the simulated flow by combining and exploiting the information provided by physical and data-driven models. To assess the performance of the proposed methodology, statistical analyses are conducted for two case studies in the Andean region, where comparative analyses are performed for the individual models and the hybrid technique. New hydrological insights: The results indicate that the proposed technique is able to improve the individual performance of physical and ANN-based models, yielding good results in the calibration and validation stages for the two case studies. Specifically, increases in NSE were observed from 0.64 to 0.99 in the MachAngara Alto river, and from 0.88 to 0.99 in the Chulco river. Higher accuracy of the hybrid technique was observed for all evaluation criteria considered in the analyses. The performance of the hybrid technique was also reflected in terms of water supply and demand, suggesting possible applications for the regional management of water resources, where accurate flow predictions are of utmost importance.",https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ejrh.2019.100652,10.1016/j.ejrh.2019.100652,"Farfan, Juan F.; Palacios, Karina; Ulloa, Jacinto; Aviles, Alex",JOURNAL OF HYDROLOGY-REGIONAL STUDIES,Neural networks; Hydrological models; Flow forecasting; Andean watersheds; Ecuador,CLIMATE-CHANGE; ADAPTATION; PREDICTION; IMPACTS; FUZZY; BASIN,,ELSEVIER,AMSTERDAM,"RADARWEG 29, 1043 NX AMSTERDAM, NETHERLANDS",,2214-5818,,J HYDROL-REG STUD,J.

285,Improving Seasonal Forecasts for Basin Scale Hydrological Applications,"Seasonal forecasting is a fast-growing climate prediction application that puts into practice the latest improvements in the climate modeling research. Skillful seasonal forecasts can drastically aid practical applications and productive sectors by reducing weather-related risks such as water availability. In this study two operational seasonal forecasting systems are tested in a water resource important watershed on the island of Crete. Hindcast precipitation and temperature data from the European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts (ECMWF) System 4 and Met Office GloSea5 systems are tested for their forecast skill up to seven months ahead. Data of both systems are downscaled and corrected for biases towards the observations. Different correction methods are applied and evaluated. Post-processed data from these methods are used as an input to the hydrological model HYPE, to provide streamflow forecasts. Results show that a prior adjustment of the two systems' precipitation and temperature may improve their forecast skill. Adjusted GloSea5 forecasts are slightly better estimates than the corresponding forecasts based on System 4. The results show that both systems provide a skillful ensemble streamflow prediction for one month ahead, with the skill decreasing rapidly beyond that. Update of the initial state of HYPE results in the reduction of the variability of the ensemble flow predictions and improves the skill but only as far as two months of forecast. Finally, the two systems were tested for their ability to capture a limited number of historical streamflow drought events, with indications that GloSea5 has a slightly better skill.",https://doi.org/10.3390/w10111593,10.3390/w10111593,"Grillakis, Manolis; Koutroulis, Aristeidis; Tsanis, Ioannis",WATER,seasonal ensemble streamflow prediction; Met Office GloSea5; ECMWF System 4; bias correction; initial conditions effect; basin scale,BIAS CORRECTION; SOIL-MOISTURE; STREAMFLOW FORECASTS; RAINFALL FORECASTS; CLIMATE; PRECIPITATION; MODEL; SKILL; TEMPERATURE; PREDICTIONS,,MDPI,BASEL,"ST ALBAN-ANLAGE 66, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND",2073-4441,,,WATER-SUI,Water,NOV,2018,10,11,,,1593,
286,Near-real time forecasting and change detection for an open ecosystem with complex natural dynamics,"Managing fire, water, biodiversity and carbon stocks can greatly benefit from early warning of changes in the state of vegetation. While near-real time tools to detect forest change based on satellite remote sensing exist, these ecosystems have relatively stable natural vegetation dynamics. Open (i.e. non-forest) ecosystems like grasslands, savannas and shrublands are more challenging as they show complex natural dynamics due to factors such as fire, postfire recovery, greater contribution of bare soil to observed vegetation indices, as well as high sensitivity to rainfall and strong seasonality. Tools to aid the management of open ecosystems are desperately required as they dominate much of the globe and harbour substantial biodiversity and carbon. We present an innovative approach that overcomes the difficulties posed by open ecosystems by using a spatio-temporal hierarchical Bayesian model that uses data on climate, topography, soils and fire history to generate ecological forecasts of the expected land surface signal under natural conditions. This allows us to monitor and detect abrupt or gradual changes in the state of an ecosystem in near-real time by identifying areas where the observed vegetation signal has deviated from the expected natural variation. We apply our approach to a case study from the hyperdiverse fire-dependent African shrubland, the fynbos of the Cape Floristic Region, a Global Biodiversity Hotspot and UNESCO World Heritage Site that faces a number of threats to vegetation health and ecosystem function. The case study demonstrates that our approach is useful for identifying a range of change agents such as fire, alien plant species invasions, drought, pathogen outbreaks and clearing of vegetation. We describe and provide our full workflow, including an interactive web application. Our approach is highly versatile, allowing us to collect data on the impacts of change agents for research in ecology and earth system science, and to predict aspects of ecosystem structure and function such as biomass, fire return interval and the influence of vegetation on hydrology.",https://doi.org/10.1016/j.isprsjprs.2020.05.017,10.1016/j.isprsjprs.2020.05.017,"Slingsby, Jasper A.; Moncrieff, Glenn R.; Wilson, Adam M.",ISPRS JOURNAL OF PHOTOGRAMMETRY AND REMOTE SENSING,Fynbos; Fire; Time series; Global change; Hierarchical Bayes; Ecological forecasting,CAPE FLORISTIC REGION; FOREST DISTURBANCE; VEGETATION COVER; LANDSAT; BIODIVERSITY; SERIES; FIRE; ALGORITHMS; HISTORY; TRENDS,,ELSEVIER,AMSTERDAM,"RADARWEG 29, 1043 NX AMSTERDAM, NETHERLANDS",0924-2716,1872-8235,,ISPRS J PHOTOGRAMM,ISPRS-J.

287,Long-Lead Seasonal Prediction of Streamflow over the Upper Colorado River Basin: The Role of the Pacific Sea Surface Temperature and Beyond,"We have developed two statistical models for extended seasonal predictions of the upper Colorado River basin (UCRB) natural streamflow during April-July: a stepwise linear regression (reduced to a simple regression with one predictor) and a neural network model. Monthly, basin-averaged soil moisture, snow water equivalent (SWE), precipitation, and the Pacific sea surface temperature (SST) are selected as potential predictors. Pacific SST predictors (PSPs) are derived from a dipole pattern over the Pacific (30 degrees S-65 degrees N) that is correlated with the lagging streamflow. For both models, the correlation between the hindcasted and observed streamflow exceeds 0.60 for lead times less than 4 months using soil moisture, SWE, and precipitation as predictors. This correlation is higher than that of an autoregression model (correlation similar to 0.50). Since these land surface and atmospheric variables have no statistically significant correlations with the streamflow, PSPs are then incorporated into the models. The two models have a correlation of similar to 0.50 using PSPs alone for lead times from 6 to 9 months, and such skills are probably associated with stronger correlation between SST and streamflow in recent decades. The similar prediction skills between the two models suggest a largely linear system between SST and streamflow. Four predictors together can further improve short-lead prediction skills (correlation similar to 0.80). Therefore, our results confirm the advantage of the Pacific SST information in predicting the UCRB streamflow with a long lead time and can provide useful climate information for water supply planning and decisions.",https://doi.org/10.1175/JCLI-D-20-0824.1,10.1175/JCLI-D-20-0824.1,"Zhao, Siyu; Fu, Rong; Zhuang, Yizhou; Wang, Gaoyun",JOURNAL OF CLIMATE,North America; Pacific Ocean; Streamflow; Sea surface temperature; Seasonal forecasting; Statistical forecasting; Neural networks,CANONICAL CORRELATION-ANALYSIS; GENESIS POTENTIAL INDEX; CLIMATE VARIABILITY; MONSOON RAINFALL; DROUGHT; SKILL; PRECIPITATION; OSCILLATION; METEOROLOGY; CHALLENGES,,AMER METEOROLOGICAL SOC,BOSTON,"45 BEACON ST, BOSTON, MA 02108-3693 USA",0894-8755,1520-0442,,J CLIMATE,J.

288,Integrating Climate Forecasts with the Soil and Water Assessment Tool (SWAT) for High-Resolution Hydrologic Simulations and Forecasts in the Southeastern US,"This study provides high-resolution modeling of daily water budget components at Hydrologic Unit Code (HUC)-12 resolution for 50 watersheds of the South Atlantic Gulf (SAG) region in the southeastern U.S. (SEUS) by implementing the Soil and Water Assessment Tool (SWAT) model in the form of a near real-time, semi-automated framework. A near real-time hydrologic simulation framework is implemented with a lead time of nine months (March-December 2017) by integrating the calibrated SWAT model with National Centers for Environmental Prediction coupled forecast system model version 2 (CFSv2) weather data to forecast daily water balance components. The modeling exercise is conducted as a precursor for various future hydrologic studies (retrospective or forecasting) for the region by providing a calibrated hydrological dataset at high spatial (HUC-12) and temporal (1-day) resolution. The models are calibrated (January 2003-December 2010) and validated (January 2011-December 2013) for each watershed using the observed streamflow data from 50 United States Geological Survey (USGS) gauging stations. The water balance analysis for the region shows that the implemented models satisfactorily represent the hydrology of the region across different sub-regions (Appalachian highlands, plains, and coastal wetlands) and seasons. While CFSv2-driven SWAT models are able to provide reasonable performance in near real-time and can be used for decision making in the region, caution is advised for using model outputs as the streamflow forecasts display significant deviation from observed streamflow for all watersheds for lead times greater than a month.",https://doi.org/10.3390/su10093079,10.3390/su10093079,"Sehgal, Vinit; Sridhar, Venkataramana; Juran, Luke; Ogejo, Jactone Arogo",SUSTAINABILITY,hydrologic modeling; soil moisture; SWAT; southeastern U; S; CFSv2; HUC-12,UNCERTAINTY ANALYSIS; UNITED-STATES; RIVER-BASIN; LAND-USE; DROUGHT; MODEL; EVAPOTRANSPIRATION; SATELLITE; MOISTURE; PREDICTION,,MDPI,BASEL,"ST ALBAN-ANLAGE 66, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND",,2071-1050,,SUSTAINABILITY-BASEL,Sustainability,SEP,2018,10,9,,,3079,
289,SATELLITE DATA ASSIMILATION TO GENERATE ENSEMBLE HYDROLOGICAL FORECASTS,"In the article the novel implementation of bias correction and data assimilation using the ensemble Kalman filter (EnKF) were presented. These methods applied as a pre-processor suitable for integration into the conceptual rainfall-runoff HBV (Hydrologiska Byrans Vattenbalansavdelning) model were assessed for hydrological modelling based on seasonal hydrographs. The enhanced HBV model was able to generate an ensemble (interval) hydrographs and averaged streamflow simulation. The proposed system, which was constructed to examine the possibility of employing EUMETSAT Satellite Application Facility on Support to Operational Hydrology and Water Management (H-SAF) data (e.g., precipitation and soil moisture), was shown to be useful in improving model updating and forecasting. Data from the Sola River mountain part of southern Poland, was used. A bias correction algorithm for a distribution derived transformation method was also developed by exploring Generalized Exponential (GE) theoretical distributions, along with Gamma (GA) and Weibull (WE) distributions on the different data used in this study. In order to remove biases in the ensemble of soil moisture the bias correction within the ensemble Kalman filter (EnKF-BC) was used as a post-processing technique. In terms of the precipitation and soil moisture satellite outputs, the EnKF-BC pre-processed HBV models significantly improved the accuracy of the simulated hydrographs in the summer season, while the positive effect of the corrected satellite precipitation was seen in the winter.",https://doi.org/,,"Ciupak, Maurycy; Ozga-Zielinski, Bogdan; Adamowski, Jan",III KRAJOWY KONGRES HYDROLOGICZNY: HYDROLOGIA W INZYNIERII I OCHRONIE SRODOWISKA,bias correction; distribution derived transformation; ensemble Kalman filter; precipitation and root zone soil moisture index; H-SAF products,SOIL-MOISTURE; MODEL,,WYDAWNICTWA KGW PAN,WARSZAWA,"UL PODLESNA 61, WARSZAWA, 01-673, POLAND",0867-7816,,,MONOGR KOM GOSPOD WE,,,2018,41,,5,19,,
290,Improving probabilistic hydroclimatic projections through high-resolution convection-permitting climate modeling and Markov chain Monte Carlo simulations,"Understanding future changes in hydroclimatic variables plays a crucial role in improving resilience and adaptation to extreme weather events such as floods and droughts. In this study, we develop high-resolution climate projections over Texas by using the convection-permitting Weather Research and Forecasting (WRF) model with 4km horizontal grid spacing, and then produce the Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC)-based hydrologic forecasts in the Guadalupe River basin which is the primary concern of the Texas Water Development Board and the Guadalupe-Blanco River Authority. The Parameter-elevation Regressions on Independent Slopes Model (PRISM) dataset is used to verify the WRF climate simulations. The Model Parameter Estimation Experiment (MOPEX) dataset is used to validate probabilistic hydrologic predictions. Projected changes in precipitation, potential evapotranspiration (PET) and streamflow at different temporal scales are examined by dynamically downscaling climate projections derived from 15 Coupled Model Intercomparison Project Phase 5 (CMIP5) general circulation models (GCMs). Our findings reveal that the Upper Coast Climate Division of Texas is projected to experience the most remarkable wetting caused by precipitation and PET changes, whereas the most significant drying is expected to occur for the North Central Texas Climate Division. The dry Guadalupe River basin is projected to become drier with a substantial increase in future drought risks, especially for the summer season. And the extreme precipitation events are projected to increase in frequency and intensity with a reduction in overall precipitation frequency, which may result in more frequent occurrences of flash floods and drought episodes in the Guadalupe River basin.",https://doi.org/10.1007/s00382-019-04702-7,10.1007/s00382-019-04702-7,"Wang, S.; Wang, Y.",CLIMATE DYNAMICS,Convection permitting; High-resolution climate projection; Hydroclimatic changes; Markov chain Monte Carlo; Pseudo global warming,REGIONAL CLIMATE; WINTER PRECIPITATION; CHANGE IMPACTS; FUTURE CHANGES; WATER-BALANCE; FORECASTS; SENSITIVITY; ROBUST; MULTIMODEL; INFERENCE,,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"ONE NEW YORK PLAZA, SUITE 4600, NEW YORK, NY, UNITED STATES",0930-7575,1432-0894,,CLIM DYNAM,Clim.

291,Long-term Reservoir Inflow Forecasts: Enhanced Water Supply and Inflow Volume Accuracy Using Deep Learning,"Machine-learning algorithms have shown promise for streamflow forecasts, reservoir operations, and scheduling, but have exhibited lower accuracy in predicting extended time horizons for reservoir inflows. Newer deep learning algorithms exhibited improved inflow forecasting accuracy, but existing research has been mostly limited to real-time operation and short-term planning. We propose a new multi-step forecasting approach to improve long-term forecasting accuracy for both water supply and inflow volumes. This approach uses historical snow water equivalent (SWE) and reservoir inflow time-series data to train an Encoder-Decoder algorithm to predict the reservoir inflow of future time-steps during the April-July runoff period. The optimal model and hyperparameters are selected through five-fold time-series cross validation for variations between long shortterm memory (LSTM) and convolutional neural network (CNN) Encoder-Decoder algorithms. We evaluated each algorithm using 30 years of reservoir inflow and SWE data at the Upper Stillwater Reservoir located in Utah. The optimal model was an LSTM Encoder-Decoder algorithm with 16 nodes per layer. Using this algorithm, we investigate the trade-off between model complexity and accuracy for long-term water supply, relative to a process-based Ensemble Streamflow Prediction (ESP) model as a baseline and simpler statistical methods traditionally used in forecasting (SARIMA, VAR, TBATS). Long-term water supply forecasts of the optimal deep learning algorithm proved superior to statistical methods and rivaled those of the ESP 50% exceedance probability forecast (i.e. the most probable forecast) evaluated over five consecutive hold-out periods.",https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jhydrol.2021.126676,10.1016/j.jhydrol.2021.126676,"Herbert, Zachary C.; Asghar, Zeeshan; Oroza, Carlos A.",JOURNAL OF HYDROLOGY,Reservoir; Forecastin; Deep learning; Snow; Inflow,ARTIFICIAL NEURAL-NETWORKS; PROBABILISTIC FORECASTS; STOCHASTIC SIMULATION; BLOCK BOOTSTRAP; TIME-SERIES; MODEL; VERIFICATION; RAINFALL; SERVICE; SYSTEM,,ELSEVIER,AMSTERDAM,"RADARWEG 29, 1043 NX AMSTERDAM, NETHERLANDS",0022-1694,1879-2707,,J HYDROL,J.

292,West Coast Forecast Challenges and Development of Atmospheric River Reconnaissance,"Water management and flood control are major challenges in the western United States. They are heavily influenced by atmospheric river (AR) storms that produce both beneficial water supply and hazards; for example, 84% of all flood damages in the West (up to 99% in key areas) are associated with ARs. However, AR landfall forecast position errors can exceed 200 km at even 1-day lead time and yet many watersheds are <100 km across, which contributes to issues such as the 2017 Oroville Dam spillway incident and regularly to large flood forecast errors. Combined with the rise of wildfires and deadly post-wildfire debris flows, such as Montecito (2018), the need for better AR forecasts is urgent. Atmospheric River Reconnaissance (AR Recon) was developed as a research and operations partnership to address these needs. It combines new observations, modeling, data assimilation, and forecast verification methods to improve the science and predictions of landfalling ARs. ARs over the northeast Pacific are measured using dropsondes from up to three aircraft simultaneously. Additionally, airborne radio occultation is being tested, and drifting buoys with pressure sensors are deployed. AR targeting and data collection methods have been developed, assimilation and forecast impact experiments are ongoing, and better understanding of AR dynamics is emerging. AR Recon is led by the Center for Western Weather and Water Extremes and NWS/NCEP. The effort's core partners include the U.S. Navy, U.S. Air Force, NCAR, ECMWF, and multiple academic institutions. AR Recon is included in the National Winter Season Operations Plan to support improved outcomes for emergency preparedness and water management in the West.",https://doi.org/10.1175/BAMS-D-19-0183.1,10.1175/BAMS-D-19-0183.1,"Ralph, F.

293,Adaptive neuro-fuzzy inference system coupled with shuffled frog leaping algorithm for predicting river streamflow time series,"Accurate runoff forecasting plays a key role in catchment water management and water resources system planning. To improve the prediction accuracy, one needs to strive to develop a reliable and accurate forecasting model for streamflow. In this study, the novel combination of the adaptive neuro-fuzzy inference system (ANFIS) model with the shuffled frog-leaping algorithm (SFLA) is proposed. Historical streamflow data of two different rivers were collected to examine the performance of the proposed model. To evaluate the performance of the proposed ANFIS-SFLA model, six different scenarios for the model input-output architecture were investigated. The results show that the proposed ANFIS-SFLA model (R-2= 0.88; NS = 0.88; RMSE = 142.30 (m(3)/s); MAE = 88.94 (m(3)/s); MAPE = 35.19%) significantly improved the forecasting accuracy and outperformed the classic ANFIS model (R-2= 0.83; NS = 0.83; RMSE = 167.81; MAE = 115.83 (m(3)/s); MAPE = 45.97%).

294,River water temperature forecasting using a deep learning method,"Accurate water temperature forecasting is essential for understanding thermal regimes of rivers in the context of climate change and anthropogenic disturbances, such as dam construction. Machine-learning models proffer an empirically based approach to predicting water temperatures with a high degree of accuracy. This study explores the potential of long short-term neural network (LSTM), a type of deep learning method, to forecast daily river water temperatures and quantify temporal variations in thermal regime induced by changes in climate and by dam construction. The performance of LSTM is compared with that of several other models using daily water-temperature data for nine river gauges around the world. In a detailed analysis, the models are evaluated for the Yichang gauge on the Yangtze River to reconstruct the natural thermal conditions and help to assess daily water temperature variations induced by operation of the Three Gorges Reservoir (TGR). The collective results show that LSTM outperforms other methods for predicting mean daily water temperature in rivers, capturing accurately mean daily variations in thermal regime. The construction of the TGR strongly influenced water temperature variations at Yichang, producing the strongest cooling effect from mid-April to mid-May and the greatest warming effect in late December and early January. These marked effects are most prominent at the highest water levels in the TGR. The enhanced predictive capabilities of the LSTM model provide a powerful tool for water temperature forecasting and ecological management of rivers in the Anthropocene.",https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jhydrol.2021.126016,10.1016/j.jhydrol.2021.126016,"Qiu, Rujian; Wang, Yuankun; Rhoads, Bruce; Wang, Dong; Qiu, Wenjie; Tao, Yuwei; Wu, Jichun",JOURNAL OF HYDROLOGY,Water temperature forecasting; Deep learning; Long short-term memory neural network; Three Gorges Reservoir; The Yangtze River,ARTIFICIAL NEURAL-NETWORK; STREAM TEMPERATURE; DISSOLVED-OXYGEN; THERMAL REGIME; CLIMATE-CHANGE; YANGTZE-RIVER; MODEL; AIR; PERFORMANCE; IMPACTS,,ELSEVIER,AMSTERDAM,"RADARWEG 29, 1043 NX AMSTERDAM, NETHERLANDS",0022-1694,1879-2707,,J HYDROL,J.

295,Forecast of AMD Quantity by a Series Tank Model in Three Stages: Case Studies in Two Closed Japanese Mines,"There are about 100 sites of acid mine drainage (AMD) from abandoned/closed mines in Japan. For their sustainable treatment, future prediction of AMD quantity is crucial. In this study, AMD quantity was predicted for two closed mines in Japan based on a series tank model in three stages. The tank model parameters were determined from the relationship between the observed AMD quantity and the inflow of rainfall and snowmelt by using the Kalman filter and particle swarm optimization methods. The Automated Meteorological Data Acquisition System (AMeDAS) data of rainfall were corrected for elevation and by the statistical daily fluctuation model. The snowmelt was estimated from the AMeDAS data of rainfall, temperature, and sunshine duration by using mass and heat balance of snow. Fitting with one year of daily data was sufficient to obtain the AMD quantity model. Future AMD quantity was predicted by the constructed model using the forecast data of rainfall and temperature proposed by the Max Planck Institute-Earth System Model (MPI-ESM), based on the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) representative concentration pathway (RCP) 2.6 and RCP8.5 scenarios. The results showed that global warming causes an increase in the quantity and fluctuation of AMD, especially for large reservoirs and residence time of AMD. There is a concern that for mines with large AMD quantities, AMD treatment will be unstable due to future global warming.",https://doi.org/10.3390/min10050430,10.3390/min10050430,"Tokoro, Chiharu; Fukaki, Kenichiro; Kadokura, Masakazu; Fuchida, Shigeshi",MINERALS,acid mine drainage; life cycle simulation; global warming; earth system model; RCP2; 6; RCP8; 5,NUCLEAR-POWER-PLANT; SORPTION MECHANISMS; ALUMINUM-HYDROXIDE; COPRECIPITATION; REDISTRIBUTION; FERRIHYDRITE; ARSENATE; SEDIMENT; CHROMATE; REMOVAL,,MDPI,BASEL,"ST ALBAN-ANLAGE 66, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND",,2075-163X,,MINERALS-BASEL,Minerals,MAY,2020,10,5,,,430,
296,Streamflow Prediction Using Deep Learning Neural Network: Case Study of Yangtze River,"The most important motivation for streamflow forecasts is flood prediction and longtime continuous prediction in hydrological research. As for many traditional statistical models, forecasting flood peak discharge is nearly impossible. They can only get acceptable results in normal year. On the other hand, the numerical methods including physics mechanisms and rainfall-atmospherics could provide a better performance when floods coming, but the minima prediction period of them is about one month ahead, which is too short to be used in hydrological application. In this study, a deep neural network was employed to predict the streamflow of the Hankou Hydrological Station on the Yangtze River. This method combined the Empirical Mode Decomposition (EMD) algorithm and Encoder Decoder Long Short-Term Memory (En-De-LSTM) architecture. Owing to the hydrological series prediction problem usually contains several different frequency components, which will affect the precision of the longtime prediction. The EMD technique could read and decomposes the original data into several different frequency components. It will help the model to make longtime predictions more efficiently. The LSTM based En-De-LSTM neural network could make the forecasting closer to the observed in peak flow value through reading, training, remembering the valuable information and forgetting the useless data. Monthly streamflow data (from January 1952 to December 2008) from Hankou Hydrological Station on the Yangtze River was selected to train the model, and predictions were made in two years with catastrophic flood events and ten years rolling forecast. Furthermore, the Root Mean Square Error (RMSE), Coefficient of Determination (R-2), Willmott & x2019;s Index of agreement (WI) and the Legates-McCabe & x2019;s Index (LMI) were used to evaluate the goodness-of-fit and performance of this model.

297,A review of the hybrid artificial intelligence and optimization modelling of hydrological streamflow forecasting,"Ever since the first introduction of Artificial Intelligence into the field of hydrology, it has further generated immense interest in researching aspects for further improvements to hydrology. This can be seen in the rising number of related works published. This culminated further with the combination of pioneering optimization techniques. Who would have thought that the birds and the bees can offer advances in the mathematical sciences and so have the ants too? The ingenuity of humans is spelled out in the algorithms that mimic many natural activities, like pack hunting by the wolves! This review paper serves to broadcast more of the intriguing interest in newfound procedures in optimal forecasting. Reservoirs are the main and most efficient water storage facilities for managing uneven water distribution. However, due to the major global climate changes which affect rainfall trend and weather, it has been a necessity to find an alternative solution for effective conventional water balance. A multifunctional reservoir operation appears to require the operator to make wise decisions to achieve an optimal reservoir operation. One of the most important aspects of all this is the forecasting of streamflows. For this, Artificial Intelligence (AI) seems to be the best alternative solution; as in the past three decades, there has been a drastic increase in building and developing AI models for forecasting and modelling unstable patterns in various hydrological fields. Nevertheless, AI models are also required to be optimized in tandem to achieve the best result, leading thus to the desirous forming of hybrid models between a standalone AI model and optimization techniques. This comprehensive study categorizes machine learning into three main categories, together with the optimization techniques, and will next explore the various AI model used for different hydrology fields along with the most common optimization techniques. Summarization of findings under every section is provided. Some advantages and disadvantages found through literature reviews are summarized for ease of reference. Finally, future recommendations and overall conclusions drawn from the results of researchers are included.

In this research, we develop streamflow forecasts for Lake Urmia basin, Iran, specifically for inflow into the Boukan and Mahabad reservoirs. In doing so, two types of inflow forecast models are considered: a single site univariate model ignoring the cross correlation between streamflow at different stations, and a multi-site multivariate forecast model which takes into consideration the cross correlations among stations. Predictor selection is performed through a principal component analysis and an adaptive-network-based fuzzy inference system is used to forecast streamflow. Forecast performance is investigated by employing different combinations of large-scale climatic information and hydrologic data. We found that gridded ocean-atmospheric circulation variables, including surface precipitation rate and omega (pressure vertical velocity), have the highest correlations (about 0.7) with annual streamflow. In general, multivariate models are able to better preserve the annual cross-correlations between streamflow at different stations, as expected, without sacrificing forecast skill as compared to the univariate forecast model approach. Additionally, as compared with the baseline feed-forward artificial neural network- and traditional multiple linear regression-forecast models, the results were approximately the same. This similarity in the forecast performance between the linear and nonlinear models is likely due to the short of data (44-sample record).",https://doi.org/10.1002/joc.6526,10.1002/joc.6526,"Moradi, Amir M.; Dariane, Alireza B.; Yang, Guang; Block, Paul",INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF CLIMATOLOGY,artificial intelligence; climate; correlation; multivariate; univariate modelling; streamflow forecast; teleconnections,FUZZY INFERENCE SYSTEM; MULTIPLE LINEAR-REGRESSION; ARTIFICIAL NEURAL-NETWORK; STREAMFLOW FORECASTS; WATER MANAGEMENT; INPUT SELECTION; LEAD-TIME; WAVELET; ANFIS; INTELLIGENCE,,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0899-8418,1097-0088,,INT J CLIMATOL,Int.

299,Merging Satellite and Gauge Rainfalls for Flood Forecasting of two Catchments under Different Climate Conditions,"As satellite rainfall data has the advantages of wide spatial coverage and high spatial and temporal resolution, it is an important means to solve the problem of flood forecasting in ungauged basins (PUB). In this paper, two catchments under different conditions, Xin'an River Basin and Wuding River Basin, were selected as the representatives of humid and arid regions, respectively, and four kinds of satellite rainfall data of TRMM 3B42RT, TRMM 3B42V7, GPM IMERG Early, and GPM IMERG Late were selected to evaluate the monitoring accuracy of rainfall processes in the two catchments on hourly scale. Then, these satellite rainfall data were respectively integrated with the gauged data. HEC-HMS (The Hydrologic Engineering Center's-Hydrologic Modeling System) model was calibrated and validated to simulate flood events in the two catchments. Then, improvement effect of the rainfall merging on flood forecasting was evaluated. According to the research results, in most cases, the Nash-Sutcliffe efficiency coefficients of the simulated streamflow from initial TRMM (Tropical Rainfall Measuring Mission) and GPM (Global Precipitation Measurement) satellite rainfall data were negative at the two catchments. By merging gauge and TRMM rainfall, the Nash-Sutcliffe efficiency coefficient is mostly around 0.7, and the correlation coefficient is as high as 0.9 for streamflow simulation in the Xin'an River basin. For the streamflow simulated by merging gauge and GPM rainfall in Wuding River basin, the Nash-Sutcliffe efficiency coefficient is about 0.8, and the correlation coefficient is more than 0.9, which indicate good flood forecasting accuracy. Generally, higher performance statistics were obtained in the Xin'an River Basin than the Wuding River Basin. Compared with the streamflow simulated by the initial satellite rainfalls, significant improvement was obtained by the merged rainfall data, which indicates a good prospect for application of satellite rainfall in hydrological forecasting. In the future, it is necessary to further improve the monitoring accuracy of satellite rainfall products and to develop the method of merging multi-source rainfall data, so as to better applications in PUB and other hydrological researches.",https://doi.org/10.3390/w12030802,10.3390/w12030802,"Min, Xinyi; Yang, Chuanguo; Dong, Ningpeng",WATER,satellite rainfall; GPM IMERG; TRMM 3B42; merging data; flood forecasting,RIVER-BASIN; TRMM; GPM; PREDICTION,,MDPI,BASEL,"ST ALBAN-ANLAGE 66, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND",,2073-4441,,WATER-SUI,Water,MAR,2020,12,3,,,802,
300,The benefit of using an ensemble of seasonal streamflow forecasts in water allocation decisions,"The area to be cropped in irrigation districts needs to be planned according to the allocated water, which in turn is a function of the available water resource. Initially conservative estimates of future (in)flows in rivers and reservoirs may lead to unnecessary reduction of the water allocated. Though water allocations may be revised as the season progresses, inconsistency in allocation is undesirable to farmers as they may then not be able to use that water, leading to an opportunity cost in agricultural production. We assess the benefit of using reservoir inflow estimates derived from seasonal forecast datasets to improve water allocation decisions. A decision model is developed to emulate the feedback loop between simulated reservoir storage and water allocations to irrigated crops and is evaluated using inflow forecasts generated with the Forecast Guided Stochastic Scenarios (FoGSS) model, a 12-month ensemble streamflow forecasting system. Two forcings are used to generate the forecasts: ensemble streamflow prediction - ESP (historical rainfall) - and POAMA (calibrated rainfall forecasts from the POAMA climate prediction system). We evaluate the approach in the Murrumbidgee basin in Australia, comparing water allocations obtained with an expected reservoir inflow from FoGSS against the allocations obtained with the currently used conservative estimate based on climatology as well as against allocations obtained using observed inflows (perfect information). The inconsistency in allocated water is evaluated by determining the total changes in allocated water made every 15 d from the initial allocation at the start of the water year to the end of the irrigation season, including both downward and upward revisions of allocations. Results show that the inconsistency due to upward revisions in allocated water is lower when using the forecast datasets (POAMA and ESP) compared to the conservative inflow estimates (reference), which is beneficial to the planning of cropping areas by farmers. Overconfidence can, however, lead to an increase in undesirable downward revisions. This is more evident for dry years than for wet years. Over the 28 years for which allocation decisions are evaluated, we find that the accuracy of the available water estimates using the forecast ensemble improves progressively during the water year, especially 1.5 months before the start of the cropping season in November. This is significant as it provides farmers with additional time to make key decisions on planting. Our results show that seasonal streamflow forecasts can provide benefit in informing water allocation policies, particularly by earlier establishing final water allocations to farmers in the irrigation season. This allows them to plan better and use water allocated more efficiently.",https://doi.org/10.5194/hess-24-3851-2020,10.5194/hess-24-3851-2020,"Kaune, Alexander; Chowdhury, Faysal; Werner, Micha; Bennett, James",HYDROLOGY AND EARTH SYSTEM SCIENCES,,MURRAY-DARLING BASIN; IRRIGATION; DROUGHT; MODEL; CLIMATE; AGRICULTURE; PREDICTION; RAINFALL; SYSTEM; REFORM,,COPERNICUS GESELLSCHAFT MBH,GOTTINGEN,"BAHNHOFSALLEE 1E, GOTTINGEN, 37081, GERMANY",1027-5606,1607-7938,,HYDROL EARTH SYST SC,Hydrol.

301,Daily river flow prediction based on Two-Phase Constructive Fuzzy Systems Modeling: A case of hydrological - meteorological measurements asymmetry,"Accurate daily river flow forecast is essential in many applications of water resources such as hydropower operation, agricultural planning and flood control. This paper presents a forecasting approach to deal with a newly addressed situation where hydrological data exist for a period longer than that of meteorological data (measurements asymmetry). In fact, one of the potential solutions to resolve measurements asymmetry issue is data re-sampling. It is a matter of either considering only the hydrological data or the balanced part of the hydro-meteorological data set during the forecasting process. However, the main disadvantage is that we may lose potentially relevant information from the left-out data. In this research, the key output is a Two-Phase Constructive Fuzzy inference hybrid model that is implemented over the non re-sampled data. The introduced modeling approach must be capable of exploiting the available data efficiently with higher prediction efficiency relative to Constructive Fuzzy Model trained over re-sampled' data set. The study was applied to Litani River in the Bekaa Valley Lebanon by using 4 years of rainfall and 24 years of river flow daily measurements. A Constructive Fuzzy System Model (C-FSM) and a Two-Phase Constructive Fuzzy System Model (TPC-FSM) are trained. Upon validating, the second model has shown a primarily competitive performance and accuracy with the ability to preserve a higher day-to-day variability for 1, 3 and 6 days ahead. In fact, for the longest lead period, the C-FSM and TPC-FSM were able of explaining respectively 84.6% and 86.5% of the actual river flow variation. Overall, the results indicate that TPC-FSM model has provided a better tool to capture extreme flows in the process of streamflow prediction. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V.

302,"Statistical and dynamical downscaling impact on projected hydrologic assessment in arid environment: A case study from Bill Williams River basin and Alamo Lake, Arizona","A study was conducted to assess the projected impact of future climate on Alamo Lake and the Bill Williams River basin. We analyzed simulations of three-selected Representative Concentration Pathways 8.5 Global Climate Models (GCM) (i.e. HadGEM2-ES, MPI-ESM-LR and GFDL-ESM2M). These GCMs which, were part of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) Fifth Assessment Report, were selected as well performing GCMs that represent the historic climatology and prevailing precipitation bearing synoptic conditions in the southwest US. An analysis of both statistically and dynamically downscaled simulations projected increase in the frequency of dry winters during the mid-21st century (2020-2059) in two out of the three selected GCMs. For summer precipitation, the statistically downscaled simulations are inconclusive whereas, the dynamically downscaled simulations showed significant but contradicting future projections. In order to assess the impact of the projected climate on the hydrologic cycle at the Bill Williams River basins, we developed a modeling framework that includes the following components: 1) a weather generator that produces realizations of likely hourly precipitation events over the basin; 2) a hydrologic model that is based on the Colorado Basin River Forecast Center (CBRFC), National Weather Service modeling configuration that predicts flow at ten internal points and inflow into Alamo Lake; and 3) a lake model with the existing operation rules to simulates the lake outflow and levels. Using the above-described modeling framework, the impact of the projected mid 21-century climate on Alamo Lake was examined with respect to the total outflow from the dam, the frequency of large outflow events, and the frequency of high and low lake levels. The results show that dynamic downscaling provides a larger range of impacts than those provided by statistical downscaling. The results also indicate a wide range of impact scenarios with contradicting trends among the selected climate projections for mid-21st Century. These results imply increasing challenges in operating the Lake at its target level. This modeling framework can potentially be used to examine various future scenarios and to develop recommendations for a sustainable management scheme for the Alamo Lake. (C) 2019 The Author(s).

303,Numerical Simulation of Groundwater Recharge from South-to-North Water Division Project,"The purpose of this study was to discuss the change in groundwater level and quantity supplemented to Mihuaishun area from South to North Water Division Project. In this study, the method of numerical simulation was adopted to predict and analysis of the trend of groundwater level in the study area within 20 years. The survey concluded that the cumulative loss of groundwater resources in Mihuaishun area in 2007 similar to 2016 reaches -1.784 x 10(9) m(3). According to the forecast, after the water source of South-to-North Water Division continues to recharge the aquifers at the rate of 0.12 billion m(3)/a for ten years, the local groundwater equilibrium changes from negative to positive, and the water level in the central funnel area increases by 25m. In addition, the artificial recharge of multiple water sources is also related to local hydrology geological conditions. The impacts of the obtained results are analyzing comprehensively the influence of South to North Water Division supplement on groundwater and providing reference for underground regulation and unified regulation of water resources after the water source of South-to-North Water Division transferred into Beijing.",https://doi.org/10.18280/ijht.370123,10.18280/ijht.370123,"Zhang, Dasheng; Zhang, Yongxiang; Yang, Yong; Li, Binghua; Li, Qiang",INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF HEAT AND TECHNOLOGY,water of south-to-north water division project; artificial recharge; numerical simulation; groundwater environment,ARTIFICIAL RECHARGE,,EDIZIONI ETS,PISA,"PIAZZA CARRARA 16-19, 56126 PISA, ITALY",0392-8764,,,INT J HEAT TECHNOL,Int.

304,Quantifying and forecasting changes in the areal extent of river valley sediment in response to altered hydrology and land cover,"In river valleys, sediment moves between active river channels, near-channel deposits including bars and floodplains, and upland environments such as terraces and aeolian dunefields. Sediment availability is a prerequisite for the sustained transfer of material between these areas, and for the eco-geomorphic functioning of river networks in general. However, the difficulty of monitoring sediment availability and movement at the reach or corridor scale has hindered our ability to quantify and forecast the response of sediment transfer to hydrologic or land cover alterations. Here we leverage spatiotemporally extensive datasets quantifying sediment areal coverage along a 28 km reach of the Colorado River in Grand Canyon, southwestern USA. In concert with information on hydrologic alteration and vegetation encroachment resulting from the operation of Glen Canyon Dam (constructed in 1963) upstream of our study reach, we model the relative and combined influence of changes in (a) flow and (b) riparian vegetation extent on the areal extent of sediment available for transport in the river valley over the period from 1921 to 2016. In addition, we use projections of future streamflow and vegetation encroachment to forecast sediment availability over the 20 year period from 2016 to 2036. We find that hydrologic alteration has reduced the areal extent of bare sediment by 9% from the pre- to post-dam periods, whereas vegetation encroachment further reduced bare sediment extent by 45%. Over the next 20 years, the extent of bare sediment is forecast to be reduced by an additional 12%. Our results demonstrate the impact of river regulation, specifically the loss of annual low flows and associated vegetation encroachment, on reducing the sediment available for transfer within river valleys. This work provides an extendable framework for using high-resolution data on streamflow and land cover to assess and forecast the impact of watershed perturbation (e.g. river regulation, land cover shifts, climate change) on sediment connectivity at the corridor scale.",https://doi.org/10.1177/0309133318795846,10.1177/0309133318795846,"Kasprak, Alan; Sankey, Joel B.; Buscombe, Daniel; Caster, Joshua; East, Amy E.; Grams, Paul E.",PROGRESS IN PHYSICAL GEOGRAPHY-EARTH AND ENVIRONMENT,Sediment connectivity; fluvial geomorphology; aeolian geomorphology; hillslope processes; riparian vegetation,STRUCTURE-FROM-MOTION; BORDERING AEOLIAN DUNEFIELDS; GLEN CANYON DAM; COLORADO RIVER; GRAND-CANYON; RIPARIAN VEGETATION; NATIONAL-PARK; TOPOGRAPHIC SURVEYS; CONTROLLED FLOODS; BED-SEDIMENT,,SAGE PUBLICATIONS LTD,LONDON,"1 OLIVERS YARD, 55 CITY ROAD, LONDON EC1Y 1SP, ENGLAND",0309-1333,1477-0296,,PROG PHYS GEOG,Prog.

305,Multiobjective stochastic programming with recourses for real-time flood water conservation of a multireservoir system under uncertain forecasts,"Flood water conservation realized through real-time multireservoir operations is effective in mitigating water scarcity. Owing to the influence of real-time inflow forecast uncertainty, determining an informed operation plan necessitates resolution of the conflict between upstream flood risk, downstream flood risk, and water scarcity risk. This study developed a multiobjective stochastic programming with recourses (MOSP) model to seek robust risk-averse plans under multiple risks. In the proposed approach, inflow forecast errors are modeled and sampled as spatially and temporally correlated stochastic processes using a copula function. The multiobjective stochastic programming is solved using the epsilon constraint method based on explicit formulation of multiple risk objectives with discretized inflow scenarios, and a rolling horizon with recourses for real-time operational updating is modeled to address the dynamic decision-making characteristics. The proposed methodologies were applied to the multireservoir system of the Pi River Basin (China), and comparisons with model results of a traditional coupled simulation and a deterministic single objective optimization model were conducted. Results indicated that capturing spatial and temporal dependencies of forecast uncertainty provides informative forecast support. Moreover, noninferior solutions obtained from MOSP dominate the deterministic optimal solution, which could either conserve 4.86 million m(3) (12%) more water without increase in flood risk, or reduce the upstream flood risk by 3.1% without increase in either water scarcity or downstream flood risk during a typical receding flood. The proposed methodology provides a dynamic decision-making modeling tool that could reduce overall risk and determine a compromise for flood water conservation under uncertainty.",https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jhydrol.2020.125513,10.1016/j.jhydrol.2020.125513,"Xu, Bin; Zhong, Ping-an; Lu, Qingwen; Zhu, Feilin; Huang, Xin; Ma, Yufei; Fu, Jisi",JOURNAL OF HYDROLOGY,Reservoir operation; Flood water conservation; Forecast uncertainty; Stochastic programming with recourses; Multiobjective optimization,DYNAMIC CONTROL; RESERVOIR OPERATION; JOINT OPERATION; OPTIMAL-DESIGN; CLIMATE-CHANGE; RISK ANALYSIS; RIVER-BASIN; RESOURCES; ENERGY; LEVEL,,ELSEVIER,AMSTERDAM,"RADARWEG 29, 1043 NX AMSTERDAM, NETHERLANDS",0022-1694,1879-2707,,J HYDROL,J.

306,Seasonal Climate Forecast Skill Assessment for the Management of Water Resources in a Run of River Hydropower System in the Poqueira River (Southern Spain),"Run of river (RoR) hydropower systems, despite being one of the most cost-effective and environmentally benign energy technologies, have the disadvantage that production is not constant because it is subject to a high variability in precipitation and snow cover. In addition, the management of RoR plants has to comply with some particular operating conditions, but also with some environmental flow requirements. This work presents the assessment of the main inputs included in a climate service, historical local data and the seasonal forecast of water inflow to RoR plants, which are used to predict the operability and the expected energy production. The analysis is presented through the application in a pilot RoR system located in the south of Spain, in a semi-arid Mediterranean area impacted by snow, where seasonal forecasting is especially challenging. The results show the high interannual variability of the operation in this kind of facilities. The outcomes indicate that seasonal climate forecast information would improve the prediction of observed river streamflow by 7.4% in reliability and 3.2% in sharpness compared to the current operational forecast based on historical data. The climate forecasts thus provide valuable information for the exploitation of available water resources, which generates a significant value for the operation of the plant and the energy production market.",https://doi.org/10.3390/w12082119,10.3390/w12082119,"Contreras, Eva; Herrero, Javier; Crochemore, Louise; Aguilar, Cristina; Jose Polo, Maria",WATER,climate service; seasonal forecast; energy production; Mediterranean high-mountain climate; reliability; sharpness,PRECIPITATION FORECASTS; STREAMFLOW; MODEL; BASIN,,MDPI,BASEL,"ST ALBAN-ANLAGE 66, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND",,2073-4441,,WATER-SUI,Water,AUG,2020,12,8,,,2119,
307,"A Multivariate Approach to Generate Synthetic Short-To-Medium Range Hydro-Meteorological Forecasts Across Locations, Variables, and Lead Times","The use of hydro-meteorological forecasts in water resources management holds great promise as a soft pathway to improve system performance. Methods for generating synthetic forecasts of hydro-meteorological variables are crucial for robust validation of forecast use, as numerical weather prediction hindcasts are only available for a relatively short period (10-40 years) that is insufficient for assessing risk related to forecast-informed decision-making during extreme events. We develop a generalized error model for synthetic forecast generation that is applicable to a range of forecasted variables used in water resources management. The approach samples from the distribution of forecast errors over the available hindcast period and adds them to long records of observed data to generate synthetic forecasts. The approach utilizes the Skew Generalized Error Distribution (SGED) to model marginal distributions of forecast errors that can exhibit heteroskedastic, auto-correlated, and non-Gaussian behavior. An empirical copula is used to capture covariance between variables, forecast lead times, and across space. We demonstrate the method for medium-range forecasts across Northern California in two case studies for (1) streamflow and (2) temperature and precipitation, which are based on hindcasts from the NOAA/NWS Hydrologic Ensemble Forecast System (HEFS) and the NCEP GEFS/R V2 climate model, respectively. The case studies highlight the flexibility of the model and its ability to emulate space-time structures in forecasts at scales critical for water resources management. The proposed method is generalizable to other locations and computationally efficient, enabling fast generation of long synthetic forecast ensembles that are appropriate for risk analysis.",https://doi.org/10.1029/2020WR029453,10.1029/2020WR029453,"Brodeur, Zachary P.; Steinschneider, Scott",WATER RESOURCES RESEARCH,synthetic forecasts; hydrometeorology; forecast informed reservoir operations; multivariate time series analysis; heteroscedasticity; empirical copula,WATER-SYSTEMS; MODELS; PRECIPITATION; PREDICTION; CALIFORNIA; RESOURCES; EVOLUTION; FRAMEWORK; INFERENCE; SELECTION,,AMER GEOPHYSICAL UNION,WASHINGTON,"2000 FLORIDA AVE NW, WASHINGTON, DC 20009 USA",0043-1397,1944-7973,,WATER RESOUR RES,Water Resour.

308,Skill of ensemble flood inundation forecasts at short- to medium-range timescales,"We investigate the ability to improve flood inundation forecasts at short- to medium-range (1-7 days) timescales through weather ensembles and statistical water surface elevation (WSE) postprocessing. To generate the flood inundation forecasts, a one-dimensional hydraulic model, namely the Hydrologic Engineering Center's River Analysis System (HEC-RAS), is coupled to a regional hydrological ensemble prediction system (RHEPS). The RHEPS is comprised of: i) hydrometeorological observations; ii) weather ensembles from the National Centers for Environmental Prediction Global Ensemble Forecast System Reforecast version 2 (GEFSRv2); and iii) Hydrology Laboratory Research Distributed Hydrologic Model (HL-RDHM) as the hydrological model. The coupled RHEPS-hydraulic system is evaluated along the tidal Delaware River near the City of Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, U.S. For the evaluation, emphasis is placed on the tidal-riverine transitional zone of the Delaware River and the downstream propagation of hydrometeorological uncertainty through the flood inundation forecasts. The coupled system is used to generate hourly flood inundation forecasts at lead times from 1 to 7 days, over the period 2008-2013. Additionally, WSEs from the coupled system are statistically postprocessed using quantile regression (QR). Results show that the raw flood inundation ensemble forecasts exhibit higher skill than the deterministic ones. We also find that statistical postprocessing improves the skill of the raw flood inundation ensemble forecasts, with greater improvements at the longer lead times (> 3 days). Overall, we find that both weather ensembles and statistical WSE postprocessing can be used to enhance the skill of flood inundation forecasts at short- to medium-range timescales. In turn, this may serve to enhance the spatial representation of flood forecasts several days in advance, which could contribute in the future to making flood forecast communication and warnings more effective.",https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jhydrol.2018.10.063,10.1016/j.jhydrol.2018.10.063,"Gomez, Michael; Sharma, Sanjib; Reed, Seann; Mejia, Alfonso",JOURNAL OF HYDROLOGY,Hydrologic-hydraulic modeling; Flood mapping; Statistical postprocessing; Numerical weather prediction; Weather ensembles,QUANTILE REGRESSION; ATLANTIC REGION; GIS TECHNIQUES; UNCERTAINTY; SYSTEM; RIVER; PREDICTION; MODEL; SCALE; CALIBRATION,,ELSEVIER,AMSTERDAM,"RADARWEG 29, 1043 NX AMSTERDAM, NETHERLANDS",0022-1694,1879-2707,,J HYDROL,J.

309,Predicting Peak Flows in Real Time through Event Based Hydrologic Modeling for a Trans-Boundary River Catchment,"Investigating the hydrological response of an area to adverse climate changes and extreme rainfall events is crucial for managing land and water resources and mitigating the natural hazards like floods. Limited availability of the in situ data, especially in case of Transboundary Rivers, further highlights the need to develop and evaluate decision support systems which may predict the flows in real time using open source rainfall data. This paper presents the study conducted in Chenab River catchment, Pakistan, to develop and evaluate a hydrologic model using HEC-HMS for predicting flows based on TRMM rainfall data. The catchment was analyzed for hydro-morphological properties using SRTM DEM in HEC-GeoHMS. To rely on open source data as much as possible, digital soil map of the world developed by FAO and global land cover map developed by European Space Agency were utilized to compute Curve Number grid data for the catchment. These preliminary data analyses were employed to set initial values of different parameters to be used for model calibration. The model was calibrated for five rainfall events occurred in the rainy seasons of 2006, 2010 and 2013. The calibrated model was then validated for four other rainfall events of similar type in the same years. Consistency in simulated and observed flows was found with percent difference in volume ranging from -6.17 % to 5.47 % and percent difference in peak flows to be in the range of 6.96 % to 7.28 %. Values of Nash-Sutcliffe Efficiency were ranging from 0.299 to 0.909 with an average value of 0.586 for all flow events. The model was found well capable of capturing the hydrologic response of the catchment due to rainfall events and can be helpful in providing alerts of peak flows in real time based on real time/forecasted rainfall data.",https://doi.org/10.1007/s11269-016-1435-2,10.1007/s11269-016-1435-2,"Shahid, Muhammad Adnan; Boccardo, Piero; Usman, Muhammad; Albanese, Adriana; Qamar, Muhammad Uzair",WATER RESOURCES MANAGEMENT,Hydrologic modeling; Peak flow events; Open source data; TRMM Rainfall; Real time analysis,RUNOFF SIMULATION; INDUS BASIN; RAINFALL; VALIDATION; SATELLITE; PAKISTAN; AFRICA; SNOW,,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0920-4741,1573-1650,,WATER RESOUR MANAG,Water Resour.

310,Muddying the Picture? Forecasting Particulate Sources and Dispersal Patterns in Managed Catchments,"Satellite imagery and climate change projections improve our ability to map and forecast sediment sources and transport pathways at high resolution, which is vital for catchment management. Detailed assessment of temporal and spatial changes in erosion risk are key to forecasting pollutant dispersal, which affects water treatment costs and ecology. Outputs from scenario modeling of the River Derwent catchment, Yorkshire, indicate clear spatial and temporal trends in erosion risk. These trends are not picked up by using traditional methods, which rely on static land use maps. Using satellite-derived maps show that lower resolution traditional land-use maps relatively underestimate erosion risk in terms of location of source areas and seasonal variation in erosion risk. Seasonal variation in agricultural practices can be assessed by incorporating bare land variation into models, which show that erosion risk is relatively overestimated if all agricultural land is assumed to have the same character. Producing seasonal land use maps also allows the assessment of temporal variation in rainfall, which in combination with climate change projections allows for adaptable management plans. The bias in gradient in modeling, which assumes that high gradients result in greater sediment erosion risk, show that traditional models underestimate the contribution of erosion risk in lowland areas. This is compounded by the absence of artificial drainages in topographic rasters, which increases connectivity in lowland areas. By producing end member scenarios, model outputs help to inform where catchment management should be targeted, and whether seasonal interventions should be implemented. This information is vital to communicate with landowners when they implement catchment management practices, such as sediment traps and earth bunds. Adaption of erosion risk modeling practices is urgently needed in order to quantify the impact of artificial interference in which human activity disrupts 'natural' sediment source-to sink configurations, such as integrating new pathways and stores due to land use change and management. Furthermore, integrating higher resolution catchment modeling and improved seasonal forecasts of pollutant flux to oceans will permit more effective interventions. This paper highlights single output erosion risk maps are not effective to inform catchment management.",https://doi.org/10.3389/feart.2019.00277,10.3389/feart.2019.00277,"Richardson, Janet Cristine; Hodgson, David Mark; Kay, Paul; Aston, Benjamin J.; Walker, Andrew C.",FRONTIERS IN EARTH SCIENCE,erosion risk; satellite imagery; seasonality; land use; sediment budget; diffuse pollution,LOWLAND AGRICULTURAL CATCHMENTS; SOIL-EROSION RISK; DIFFUSE POLLUTION; SEDIMENT CONNECTIVITY; SUSPENDED SEDIMENT; WATER-QUALITY; OVERLAND-FLOW; FRESH-WATER; RIVER; IMPACT,,FRONTIERS MEDIA SA,LAUSANNE,"AVENUE DU TRIBUNAL FEDERAL 34, LAUSANNE, CH-1015, SWITZERLAND",,2296-6463,,FRONT EARTH SC-SWITZ,Front.

In this study, the accuracy of four artificial intelligence (AI) methods, including the generalized regression neural network (GRNN), least-square support vector machine (LSSVM), group method of data handling (GMDH), and adaptive neuro-fuzzy inference systems with fuzzy C-means clustering (ANFIS-FCM), were investigated in forecasting the MSPI of three synoptic stations (Jolfa, Kerman, and Tehran) located in the arid-cold climate of Iran. The data used was monthly precipitation and belongs to a 30-year period (1988-2017). MSPI values were calculated in five time windows, including the following: 3-6 (MSPI3-6), 6-12 (MSPI6-12), 3-12 (MSPI3-12), 12-24 (MSPI12-24), and 24-48 (MSPI24-48). The period of 1988-2016 was considered for training (75%) and testing (25%), and 2017 (12 months) was used for long-term forecasting. The methods were evaluated by the root mean square error (RMSE), mean absolute error (MAE), Willmott index (WI), and Taylor diagram. In the short-term forecasting phase, results showed that the methods had their best performances in forecasting multivariate drought types of groundwater hydrologyeconomic-social (MSPI24-48), agricultural-groundwater hydrology (MSPI12-24), surface hydrology-agricultural (MSPI6-12), soil moisturesurface hydrology-agricultural (MSPI3-12), and soil moisture-surface hydrology (MSPI3-6), respectively. Also, among the mentioned methods, the weakest accuracy was reported for GRNN with an RMSE = 0.673, MAE = 0.499, and WI = 0.750 (related to MSPI3-6 of the Kerman station): the most accurate performance resulted from the GMDH with RMSE = 0.097, MAE = 0.074, and WI = 0.989 (related to MSPI24-48 of the Jolfa station). In spite of the acceptable performance of the models in short-term forecasting, by increasing the forecasting horizons, the models' errors were increased in the long-term forecasting phase. The models could have acceptable long-terns forecasts for just two months (or in some exceptional cases, three months) ahead. Further, according to the investigations, it can be shown that the methods show better performances in mountainous arid-cold regions, compared to desert arid-cold regions. As a theoretical study of multivariate drought forecasting, the AIs have promising results, and this research can be extended for the other regions.

312,"Evaluation of the fast orthogonal search method for forecasting chloride levels in the Deltona groundwater supply (Florida, USA)","Despite the broad impact and importance of saltwater intrusion in coastal aquifers, little research has been directed towards forecasting saltwater intrusion in areas where the source of saltwater is uncertain. Saline contamination in inland groundwater supplies is a concern for numerous communities in the southern US including the city of Deltona, Florida. Furthermore, conventional numerical tools for forecasting saltwater contamination are heavily dependent on reliable characterization of the physical characteristics of underlying aquifers, information that is often absent or challenging to obtain. To overcome these limitations, a reliable alternative data-driven model for forecasting salinity in a groundwater supply was developed for Deltona using the fast orthogonal search (FOS) method. FOS was applied on monthly water-demand data and corresponding chloride concentrations at water supply wells. Groundwater salinity measurements from Deltona water supply wells were applied to evaluate the forecasting capability and accuracy of the FOS model. Accurate and reliable groundwater salinity forecasting is necessary to support effective and sustainable coastal-water resource planning and management. The available (27) water supply wells for Deltona were randomly split into three test groups for the purposes of FOS model development and performance assessment. Based on four performance indices (RMSE, RSR, NSEC, and R), the FOS model proved to be a reliable and robust forecaster of groundwater salinity. FOS is relatively inexpensive to apply, is not based on rigorous physical characterization of the water supply aquifer, and yields reliable estimates of groundwater salinity in active water supply wells.",https://doi.org/10.1007/s10040-017-1719-5,10.1007/s10040-017-1719-5,"El-Jaat, Majda; Hulley, Michael; Tetreault, Michel",HYDROGEOLOGY JOURNAL,FOS; Groundwater management; Saline intrusion; Numerical modeling; USA,ARTIFICIAL NEURAL-NETWORKS; COASTAL AQUIFERS; SEAWATER INTRUSION; MODEL; MANAGEMENT; OPTIMIZATION; SCENARIOS; ALGORITHM,,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"233 SPRING ST, NEW YORK, NY 10013 USA",1431-2174,1435-0157,,HYDROGEOL J,Hydrogeol.

313,Predicting adverse scenarios for a transboundary coastal aquifer system in the Atacama Desert (Peru/Chile),"The Caplina/Concordia transboundary coastal aquifer system, located in the Atacama Desert, is the primary source of water supply for domestic use and irrigation for La Yarada-Los Palos (Peru) and Concordia (Chile) agriculture districts, and to a lesser extent, for Tacna province public supply use (Peru). Despite the scarce amount of rainfall (<20 mm/year) in the area and the limited recharge coming from the Andean highlands, this transboundary aquifer system has been overexploited mainly for agriculture since before the 2000s on the Peruvian side. Consequently, this has caused groundwater depletion and seawater intrusion. In this study, comprehensive hydrogeological information was integrated to understand the aquifer system's behavior and the effects to which it has been subjected to groundwater overexploitation. To that end, a 3D hydrogeological framework was developed using the LEAPFROG software and a constant-density groundwater flow model with equivalent heads was generated in FEFLOW software, which was adjusted with Monte Carlo analysis and conventional automated calibration. Finally, eight scenarios, considering various water resource management options proposed by the authority and potential climatic trends (CMIP6), were simulated from 2020 to 2040. The results showed that between 2002 and 2020, the increase in the seawater wedge and the average groundwater level decline were 216 hm3/year and 7 m, respectively. It is expected that the depletion will continue with a groundwater level decline between 5 and 8 m and an increase in the seawater wedge between 1120 hm3/year and 1175 hm(3)/year for the forecast period. The study concludes that the aquifer system will remain unsustainable for the next 20 years, regardless of the selected scenarios, and suggests that any mitigation measure requires the participation of stakeholders from Peru, Chile, and Bolivia.

314,Using NARX neural network to forecast droughts and floods over Yangtze River Basin,"Drought and flood events are two extreme climate phenomena which usually bring enormous economic and social loss. For meeting the goal of flood and drought prevention, the nonlinear autoregressive with exogenous input (NARX) neural network is employed to bridge the data gap between the Gravity Recovery and Climate Experiment (GRACE) and GRACE Follow On (GRACE-FO) over Yangtze River Basin (YRB). The precipitation data from NASA Global Precipitation Measurement, temperature data from Global Historical Climatology Network and the Climate Anomaly Monitoring System, and terrestrial water storage anomalies (TWSA) from Global Land Data Assimilation System (GLDAS) are considered as the external inputs. Meanwhile, the performance of NARX models is evaluated for all possible combinations of time delays and neurons in order to find the optimal model structures. Then total storage deficit index (TSDI) is constructed based on TWSA reconstructions to assess drought and flood events over YRB, along with forecasting the extremes during the data gap period. The results show that when the number of time delays and neurons equals one and nine, respectively, the NARX model has an optimal performance with root mean square error (rmse), scaled rmse R*, Nash-Sutcliff Efficiency (NSE) and correlation coefficient r of 1.34 cm, 0.34, 0.95 and 0.94, respectively. As indicated by TSDI and comparisons with previous studies, YRB has switched from drought periods to increased flood risks with a moderate correlation to global warming and E1 Nino-Southern Oscillation (ENSO). Finally, the most important conclusion that we successfully predict the flood events during the data gap period suggests that NARX neural network is promising for forecasting short-term hydrological extremes over YRB.",https://doi.org/10.1007/s11069-021-04944-x,10.1007/s11069-021-04944-x,"Wang, Jielong; Chen, Yi",NATURAL HAZARDS,NARX; Total storage deficit index; Droughts and floods; GRACE; Global warming,TERRESTRIAL WATER STORAGE; GRACE; PRECIPITATION; MOISTURE; DEFICIT,,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"ONE NEW YORK PLAZA, SUITE 4600, NEW YORK, NY, UNITED STATES",0921-030X,1573-0840,,NAT HAZARDS,Nat.

315,How risk decision-makers interpret and use flood forecast information: assessing the Mississippi River Outlook email product,"While the National Weather Service and its River Forecast Centers and Weather Forecast Offices produce visuals, graphics, and outreach designed to support weather forecasts and warnings and inform decisions about natural resource management and emergency services, opportunities exist for risk communication scholarship to refine theory and promote best practices for communicating such information to the various stakeholders who need it. In September 2019, two focus groups were conducted with a sample (N = 14) of National Weather Service-Memphis' core partners to gauge perceptions about how the Weather Forecast Office provides technical information about flood risk patterns, paying particular attention to evaluations of its Mississippi River Outlook product. Research findings demonstrated that core partners may benefit from targeting risk information depending on partners' information needs and their technical knowledge/expertise. Similarly, the results suggested a need to offer context or interpretation for unique data points (e.g., gage tables, experimental forecasts, charts, and graphs) to successfully communicate important risk information and to clarify potential misunderstandings; this consideration was underscored by the finding that core partners tended to disseminate the Mississippi River Outlook product to others in the community (e.g., business owners; residents). These findings highlight the importance of audience testing in the development of risk communication and decision-making tools.",https://doi.org/10.1080/13669877.2020.1819390,10.1080/13669877.2020.1819390,"VanDyke, Matthew S.; Armstrong, Cory L.; Bareford, Karen",JOURNAL OF RISK RESEARCH,Two; step flow; risk communication; decision-making; opinion leaders,2-STEP FLOW; COMMUNICATION; DROUGHT; MODELS; NEEDS,,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1366-9877,1466-4461,,J RISK RES,J.

316,The role of probabilistic precipitation forecasts in hydrologic predictability,"Accurate streamflow forecasts enable the appropriate management of water resources. Although there is a general consensus that climate information can enhance hydrological predictability, this might not be the case if the accuracy of the given climate information is unreliable. Hence, this study has developed a modeling framework to estimate the role of climate information in forecasting accurate streamflow. Ensemble streamflow prediction (ESP) technology was adopted as a dynamic hydrologic forecast method to 35 watersheds in South Korea. The probabilistic precipitation forecast (PPF), issued by the Korea Meteorological Administration, was used as climate information for updating the probabilities of climate scenarios. First, we found that the current PPF is not accurate enough for significantly enhancing the streamflow forecasting accuracy. Subsequently, multiple sets of PPF were synthetically generated to evaluate the role of climate information. Given the perfect categorical climate forecasts, we found that there is much potential for the enhancement of streamflow forecast skill especially in the seasons that exhibit greater streamflow variability. However, there is less potential for increasing the streamflow forecasting skill under below-normal conditions. The proposed modeling framework is capable of quantifying the magnitude of potential improvement in hydrological predictability under the assumption that better climate information will be available in the future. We expect that this modeling framework can be effectively applied to other regions across a wide range of climate regimes.",https://doi.org/10.1007/s00704-020-03273-6,10.1007/s00704-020-03273-6,"Seo, Seung Beom; Sung, Jang Hyun",THEORETICAL AND APPLIED CLIMATOLOGY,Streamflow forecast; Probabilistic precipitation forecast; ESP; Climate information; Hydrological predictability,ENSEMBLE STREAMFLOW FORECASTS; RUNOFF MODEL; CLIMATE; PREDICTION; RAINFALL; WEATHER; ENSO; OPTIMIZATION; OPERATION; TIME,,SPRINGER WIEN,WIEN,"SACHSENPLATZ 4-6, PO BOX 89, A-1201 WIEN, AUSTRIA",0177-798X,1434-4483,,THEOR APPL CLIMATOL,Theor.

317,Stream water quality prediction using boosted regression tree and random forest models,"Reliable water quality prediction can improve environmental flow monitoring and the sustainability of the stream ecosystem. In this study, we compared two machine learning methods to predict water quality parameters, such as total nitrogen (TN), total phosphorus (TP), and turbidity (TUR), for 97 watersheds located in the Southeast Atlantic region of the USA. The modeling framework incorporates multiple climate and watershed variables (characteristics) that often control the water quality indicators in different landscapes. Three techniques, such as stepwise regression (SR), Least Absolute Shrinkage and Selection Operator (LASSO), and genetic algorithm (GA), are implemented to identify appropriate predictors out of 28 climate and catchment-related variables. The selected predictors were then used to develop the Random Forest (RF) and Boosted regression tree (BRT) models for water quality predictions in selected watersheds. The results highlighted that while both algorithms provided reasonable results (based on statistical metrics), the RF algorithm was easier to train and robust to model overfitting. Partial dependence plots highlighted the complex and nonlinear relationships between the individual predictors and the water quality indicators. The thresholds obtained from partial dependence plots showed that the median values of total nitrogen (TN) and total phosphorus (TP) in streams increase significantly when the percentage of urban and agricultural lands is above 40% and 43% of the watershed area, respectively. Furthermore, when soil hydraulic conductivity increases, the reduction in runoff results in decreased Turbidity levels in streams. Therefore, identifying the key watershed characteristics and their critical thresholds can help watershed managers create appropriate regulations for managing and sustaining healthy stream ecosystems. Besides, the forecasting models can improve water quality predictions in ungauged watersheds.",https://doi.org/10.1007/s00477-021-02152-4,10.1007/s00477-021-02152-4,"Alnahit, Ali O.; Mishra, Ashok K.; Khan, Abdul A.",STOCHASTIC ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH AND RISK ASSESSMENT,Water quality; Machine learning algorithms; Random forests; Boosted regression trees,SOIL ORGANIC-CARBON; LAND-USE; MACROINVERTEBRATE ASSEMBLAGES; LINEAR-REGRESSION; RIVER-BASIN; FRESH-WATER; MULTIPLE; COVER; CLASSIFICATION; PHOSPHORUS,,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"ONE NEW YORK PLAZA, SUITE 4600, NEW YORK, NY, UNITED STATES",1436-3240,1436-3259,,STOCH ENV RES RISK A,Stoch.

318,Application of optimized Support Vector Machine in monthly streamflow forecasting: using Autocorrelation Function for input variables estimation,"Hydrologic forecasting serves as an important tool in water resource management to mitigate disasters and managing water infrastructures. In field of hydrology, models for time series forecasting have been developed throughout the years, including the application of data-driven models. In this research, application of Artificial Intelligence (AI) technique in Support Vector Machine (SVM) method is used to forecast monthly discharge in Pemali River Basin, Indonesia. SVM method, optimized with fast messy genetic algorithm (fmGA), is employed for time series forecasting, whereas input data rely solely on previous values. Model performance is assessed with three different performance metrics and against Seasonal Autoregressive Moving Average (SARIMA) method for comparison. Scenarios are constructed with different input pattern for SVM to identify appropriate input data for giving good prediction accuracy. Input data are developed with and without selecting mechanism. Selecting mechanism is done based on assessment in Autocorrelation Function (ACF) coefficient of the time series data. While input data without the selecting mechanism consist of monthly discharge up to lag time 12 months prior (Q(t-1), Q(t-2), ... ,Q(t-12)). The result shows that input data with good correlation can give good prediction accuracy. Involvement of poorly correlated input data series may decrease model performance. However, with proper combination of input data, SVM can have good forecasting accuracy regardless of having the poorly correlated input data. Coherently, appropriate input data combination can reduce the number of support vectors in SVM, thus scaling down the risk of over fitting data.",https://doi.org/10.1007/s40899-021-00506-y,10.1007/s40899-021-00506-y,"Christian, Kevin; Roy, Andreas F.

319,Land use change uncertainty impacts on streamflow and sediment projections in areas undergoing rapid development: A case study in the Mekong Basin,"Quantitative understanding of potential changes in streamflow and sediment load is complicated by uncertainty related to land use change projections, which is characterized by a high uncertainty in terms of demand (quantity) and location of changes (spatial distribution). We simulate the Sesan, Srepok, and Sekong Rivers (3S), the most important tributaries of the lower Mekong River, with the Soil and Water Assessment Tool (SWAT) to investigate the implications of conversion of forest to agricultural lands. Multiple land use transitions in the 3S basin are projected using the Land Change Modeler. The uncertainty in land use projection was addressed using an ensemble forecasting approach for 2060, combining (a) three land demand scenarios, (b) two transition potential modeling approaches (i.e., approach to create maps of the likelihood for areas to transition from one land use type to another), and (c) retaining or not protected areas. Land demand leads to the greatest uncertainty in land use change projections. Transition potential modeling approaches do not make much difference in the total change, but can result in spatial variations of change. Retaining protected areas can contribute significantly to uncertainty in land use change projections. Decrease in annual streamflow of the 3S basin varied from 3% to 21%, and changes in annual sediment outflux from the basin ranged from -8% to 249% for simulated scenarios. Land use demand uncertainty results in the highest streamflow and sediment load changes and can thus have major consequences for water and sediment management strategies in areas undergoing rapid development.",https://doi.org/10.1002/ldr.2831,10.1002/ldr.2831,"Shrestha, Bikesh; Cochrane, Thomas A.; Caruso, Brian S.; Arias, Mauricio E.",LAND DEGRADATION & DEVELOPMENT,deforestation; land change modeler; sediment; South East Asia; SWAT; Mekong Basin,SWAT MODEL APPLICATION; LARGE RIVER-BASIN; SUSPENDED SEDIMENT; HYDROLOGICAL IMPACTS; USE/COVER CHANGE; WATER-RESOURCES; CLIMATE-CHANGE; ENSEMBLE; FOREST; SOIL,,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",1085-3278,1099-145X,,LAND DEGRAD DEV,Land Degrad.

320,Skill of Rain-Snow Level Forecasts for Landfalling Atmospheric Rivers: A Multimodel Assessment Using California's Network of Vertically Profiling Radars,"The partitioning of rain and snow during atmospheric river (AR) storms is a critical factor in flood forecasting, water resources planning, and reservoir operations. Forecasts of atmospheric rain-snow levels from December 2016 to March 2017, a period of active AR landfalls, are evaluated using 19 profiling radars in California. Three forecast model products are assessed: a global forecast model downscaled to 3-km grid spacing, 4-km river forecast center operational forecasts, and 50-km global ensemble reforecasts. Model forecasts of the rain-snow level are compared with observations of rain-snow melting-level brightband heights. Models produce mean bias magnitudes of less than 200 m across a range of forecast lead times. Error magnitudes increase with lead time and are similar between models, averaging 342 m for lead times of 24 h or less and growing to 700-800 m for lead times of greater than 144 h. Observed extremes in the rain-snow level are underestimated, particularly for warmer events, and the magnitude of errors increases with rain-snow level. Storms with high rain-snow levels are correlated with larger observed precipitation rates in Sierra Nevada watersheds. Flood risk increases with rain-snow levels, not only because a greater fraction of the watershed receives rain, but also because warmer storms carry greater water vapor and thus can produce heavier precipitation. The uncertainty of flood forecasts grows nonlinearly with the rain-snow level for these reasons as well. High rain-snow level ARs are a major flood hazard in California and are projected to be more prevalent with climate warming.",https://doi.org/10.1175/JHM-D-18-0212.1,10.1175/JHM-D-18-0212.1,"Henn, Brian; Weihs, Rachel; Martin, Andrew C.; Ralph, F.

321,CROP AND LOCATION SPECIFIC AGRICULTURAL DROUGHT QUANTIFICATION: PART III. FORECASTING WATER STRESS AND YIELD TRENDS,"Agriculture is the largest water consumer, with 70% of global water withdrawals being used for irrigation. Water scarcity issues are being exacerbated by drought and population increases, making efficient water resource management in agricultural production increasingly important. The objective of this article is to evaluate the use of short-term weather forecasts for agricultural drought prediction. A crop-specific, linear regression drought analysis technique was used in this study. This study takes place in the upper Colorado River basin (UCRB) in west Texas. Five variables associated with agricultural drought (precipitation, temperature, biomass production, soil moisture depletion, and transpiration) were scaled and used to estimate cotton yields. The yield percentiles were used as a drought index. Precipitation and temperature were forecasted with a two-week lead time using probable scenarios based on historical data. The other three variables were estimated using the SWAT model. Forecasts were generated for each week of the growing season from 2010 through 2013. Four statistics were used to evaluate model performance, including the Nash-Sutcliffe coefficient of efficiency (NSE), the coefficient of determination (R-2), and two error indices, the percent bias (PBIAS) and the RMSE-observations standard deviation ratio (RSR). Comparing the variables using the forecasted weather data to those using the observed weather data revealed that four of the five performed satisfactorily. Temperature performed the best statistically, with an NSE of 0.85 and PBIAS of 9.4%. Precipitation (NSE = 0.51, PBIAS = -34%), cumulative biomass (NSE = 0.69, PBIAS = -38%), and transpiration (NSE = 0.53, PBIAS = 11%) also performed well. However, the soil moisture depletion forecasts (NSE = 0.28, PBIAS = 11%) were unsatisfactory. The forecasted cotton yield trends (NSE = 0.72, PBIAS = -12%) and drought index (NSE = 0.76, PBIAS = -13%) both performed satisfactorily, indicating that this forecasting method may be used for decision making related to agricultural water management, including irrigation timing.",https://doi.org/10.13031/trans.11651,10.13031/trans.11651,"McDaniel, R.

322,Monthly streamflow forecasting using continuous wavelet and multi-gene genetic programming combination,"Streamflow is an essential component of the hydrologic cycle in the regional and global scale and the main source of fresh water supply. It is highly associated with natural disasters, such as droughts and floods. Therefore, accurate streamflow forecasting is essential. Forecasting streamflow in general and monthly streamflow in particular is a complex process that cannot be handled by data-driven models (DDMs) only and requires pre-processing. Wavelet transformation is a pre-processing technique; however, application of continuous wavelet transformation (CWT) produces many scales that cause deterioration in the performance of any DDM because of the high number of redundant variables. This study proposes multigene genetic programming (MGGP) as a selection tool. After the CWT analysis, it selects important scales to be imposed into the artificial neural network (ANN). A basin located in the southeast of Turkey is selected as case study to prove the forecasting ability of the proposed model. One month ahead downstream flow is used as output, and downstream flow, upstream, rainfall, temperature, and potential evapotranspiration with associated lags are used as inputs. Before modeling, wavelet coherence transformation (WCT) analysis was conducted to analyze the relationship between variables in the time-frequency domain. Several combinations were developed to investigate the effect of the variables on streamflow forecasting. The results indicated a high localized correlation between the streamflow and other variables, especially the upstream. In the models of the standalone layout where the data were entered to ANN and MGGP without CWT, the performance is found poor. In the best-scale layout, where the best scale of the CWT identified as the highest correlated scale is chosen and enters to ANN and MGGP, the performance increased slightly. Using the proposed model, the performance improved dramatically particularly in forecasting the peak values because of the inclusion of several scales in which seasonality and irregularity can be captured. Using hydrological and meteorological variables also improved the ability to forecast the streamflow.",https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jhydrol.2018.04.036,10.1016/j.jhydrol.2018.04.036,"Hadi, Sinan Jasim; Tombul, Mustafa",JOURNAL OF HYDROLOGY,Wavelet coherence transformation; Continuous wavelet transformation; Artificial neural network; Data-driven models,ARTIFICIAL NEURAL-NETWORKS; RAINFALL-RUNOFF PROCESS; DATA-DRIVEN TECHNIQUES; TIME-SERIES ANALYSIS; NON-PERENNIAL RIVERS; INTELLIGENCE MODELS; SHORT-TERM; PREDICTION; TRANSFORM; ANN,,ELSEVIER SCIENCE BV,AMSTERDAM,"PO BOX 211, 1000 AE AMSTERDAM, NETHERLANDS",0022-1694,1879-2707,,J HYDROL,J.

323,Forecasting hydropower generation by GFDL-CM3 climate model and hybrid hydrological-Elman neural network model based on Improved Sparrow Search Algorithm (ISSA),"One of the most sensitive factors affecting hydropower generation is climate change. The objective of this study is to forecast the hydropower generation under the influence of climate change for the next 50 years. For this purpose, the GFDL-CM3 model is used under three scenarios: RCP2.6, RCP4.5, and RCP8.5 to predict precipitation and temperature. Any change in the inlet flow to the turbine will cause changes in the hydropower output. Therefore, the more accurately the flow is estimated, the hydropower generation is forecasted more accurately. In this research, a hydrological-neural network hybrid model for flow prediction is presented in which the Improved Sparrow Search Algorithm (ISSA) has been used. The results forecasting climate parameters showed that the average annual rainfall, runoff, and evaporation have a downward trend compared to the control period. The minimum and maximum annual temperatures have an increasing trend compared to the control period. To evaluate the hydropower generation Aras dam, the HEC-Ressim reservoir model is utilized. By comparing the average annual hydropower with the control period, it is known that the power generation will decrease in future years. The average annual electricity generated by hydropower under the scenario RCP2.6 and RCP4.5 and RCP8.5 in the next 50 years will decrease by approximately 3.36, 4.62, and 6.64 MW.",https://doi.org/10.1002/cpe.6476,10.1002/cpe.6476,"Wang, Haizhen; Wu, Xuerui; Gholinia, Fatemeh",CONCURRENCY AND COMPUTATION-PRACTICE & EXPERIENCE,climate change; GFDL-CM3 model; hydropower generation; optimization algorithm; precipitation patterns,FEATURE-SELECTION; CHANGE IMPACTS; POWER; BASIN; RELIABILITY; PREDICTION; OPERATION; SYSTEM; ENGINE; SWAT,,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",1532-0626,1532-0634,,CONCURR COMP-PRACT E,Concurr.

324,Varying-parameter modeling within ensemble architecture: Application to extended streamflow forecasting,"Extended streamflow forecasting is nowadays important for early flood warning and risk mitigation under a changing climate. However, the absence of reliable estimates of the usual streamflow descriptors, at the considered time horizons, renders common input-output modeling approaches inapt for extended forecasting. For such a problem, system recurrence information is vital to produce relatively improved forecasts. Like any time series generated by complex systems, river flow can be represented by a time-varying parameter (TVP) model. TVP modeling frameworks often assume that the system evolution exhibits superstatistical random walks, and a number of statistical assumptions is followed upon, to infer better forecasts from the system. Also, the TVPs should hone a model's ability to capture system recurrence, which in this case translates to a number of state-based model structures. In this work, we develop an ensemble-based computationally efficient method that extracts useful cyclic-type TVPs which are strongly coupled over extended, but more continuous and less aggregated, time horizons. A multi-level modeling framework is proposed to facilitate the creation and direct use of updated parameter states to produce more reliable forecasts on the considered temporal resolutions. A dummy-variable optimization technique is also proposed within the state-updating procedure to allow smooth state transition. We show that the modeling framework produces stable results of parameter variations at different time horizons when applied to estimate the streamflow of Clearwater River. The proposed framework can incorporate exogenous descriptors at different levels without loss of generality and can be used for various forecasting applications.",https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jhydrol.2019.124511,10.1016/j.jhydrol.2019.124511,"Alobaidi, Mohammad H.; Meguid, Mohamed A.; Chebana, Fateh",JOURNAL OF HYDROLOGY,System Identification; Time-varying paramter (TVP); Multi-level modeling; Dummy variable optimization; Ensemble Learning; Streamflow forecasting,SUBSPACE IDENTIFICATION; KALMAN FILTER; TIME,,ELSEVIER,AMSTERDAM,"RADARWEG 29, 1043 NX AMSTERDAM, NETHERLANDS",0022-1694,1879-2707,,J HYDROL,J.

325,"Application of static and dynamic artificial neural networks for forecasting inflow discharges, case study: Sefidroud Dam reservoir","Accurate forecasting of reservoir inflow is of great importance in water resources planning and management and it can highly affect decisions and policies of reservoir operation with respect to flood control, drought management, water supply, and hydropower generation. In this study, different models of static and dynamic artificial neural networks (ANN) including static feed forward neural network (FFNN), nonlinear autoregressive (NAR), and nonlinear autoregressive with exogenous inputs (NARX) are employed in order to forecast Sefidroud Dam reservoir inflows. The capability of studied networks with a range of different input variables in predicting reservoir inflows are then compared. All employed models are trained using inflow discharge and precipitation data with different time delays and an optimum number of neurons in the hidden layers are obtained. In addition, the time index (T) is also employed as the input data to the proposed models in order to increase the accuracy of the estimates. The obtained results indicate that NAR dynamic neural network has a better performance in comparison with FFNN and NARX models. Furthermore, using 12 time delays for inflow discharges and precipitation data leads to the best accessible results where adding time index (T) increases the accuracy. The results obtained from this study provide useful information for reservoir inflow simulation. In other words, these results are critical for water resources management and planning particularly in the field of dam reservoir operation which is crucial under reported water crisis in Iran.

326,"Assessing and Predicting the Water Resources Vulnerability under Various Climate-Change Scenarios: A Case Study of Huang-Huai-Hai River Basin, China","The Huang-Huai-Hai River Basin plays an important strategic role in China's economic development, but severe water resources problems restrict the development of the three basins. Most of the existing research is focused on the trends of single hydrological and meteorological indicators. However, there is a lack of research on the cause analysis and scenario prediction of water resources vulnerability (WRV) in the three basins, which is the very important foundation for the management of water resources. First of all, based on the analysis of the causes of water resources vulnerability, this article set up the evaluation index system of water resource vulnerability from three aspects: water quantity, water quality and disaster. Then, we use the Improved Blind Deletion Rough Set (IBDRS) method to reduce the dimension of the index system, and we reduce the original 24 indexes to 12 evaluation indexes. Third, by comparing the accuracy of random forest (RF) and artificial neural network (ANN) models, we use the RF model with high fitting accuracy as the evaluation and prediction model. Finally, we use 12 evaluation indexes and an RF model to analyze the trend and causes of water resources vulnerability in three basins during 2000-2015, and further predict the scenarios in 2020 and 2030. The results show that the vulnerability level of water resources in the three basins has been improved during 2000-2015, and the three river basins should follow the development of scenario 1 to ensure the safety of water resources. The research proved that the combination of IBDRS and an RF model is a very effective method to evaluate and forecast the vulnerability of water resources in the Huang-Huai-Hai River Basin.",https://doi.org/10.3390/e22030333,10.3390/e22030333,"Chen, Yan; Feng, Yazhong; Zhang, Fan; Yang, Fan; Wang, Lei",ENTROPY,Huang-Huai-Hai river basin; water resources vulnerability; assessment; scenario prediction; random forest model,ROUGH SET; REGION; AREAS; SCALE,,MDPI,BASEL,"ST ALBAN-ANLAGE 66, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND",,1099-4300,,ENTROPY-SWITZ,Entropy,MAR,2020,22,3,,,333,
327,"Projecting Wet Season Rainfall Extremes Using Regional Climate Models Ensemble and the Advanced Delta Change Model: Impact on the Streamflow Peaks in Mkurumudzi Catchment, Kenya","Each year, many African countries experience natural hazards such as floods and, because of their low adaptative capabilities, they hardly have the means to face the consequences, and therefore suffer huge economic losses. Extreme rainfall plays a key role in the occurrence of these hazards. Therefore, climate projection studies should focus more on extremes in order to provide a wider range of future scenarios of extremes which can aid policy decision making in African societies. Some researchers have attempted to analyze climate extremes through indices reflecting extremes in climate variables such as rainfall. However, it is difficult to assess impacts on stream-flow based on these indices alone, as most hydrological models require daily data as inputs. Others have analyzed climate projections through general circulation models (GCMs) but have found their resolution too coarse for regional studies. Dynamic downscaling using regional climate models (RCMs) seem to address the limitation of GCMs, although RCMs might still lack accuracy due to the fact that they also contain biases that need to be eliminated. Given these limitations, the current study combined both dynamic and statistical downscaling methods to correct biases and improve the reproduction of high extremes by the models. This study's aim was to analyze extreme high flows under the projection of extreme wet rainfall for the horizon of 2041 of a Kenyan South Coast catchment. The advanced delta change (ADC) method was applied on observed data (1982-2005), control (1982-2005) and near future (2018-2041) from an ensemble mean of multiple regional climate models (RCMs). The created future daily rainfall time series was introduced in the HEC-HMS (Hydrologic Engineering Center's Hydrologic Modeling System) hydrological model and the generated future flow were compared to the baseline flow at the gaging station 3KD06, where the observed flow was available. The findings suggested that in the study area, the RCMs, bias corrected by the ADC method, projected an increase in rainfall wet extremes in the first rainy season of the year MAMJ (March-April-May-June) and a decrease in the second rainy season OND (October-November-December). The changes in rainfall extremes, induced a similar change pattern in streamflow extremes at the gaging station 3KD06, meaning that an increase/decrease in rainfall extremes generated an increase/decrease in the streamflow extremes. Due to lack of long-term good quality data, the researchers decided to perform a frequency analysis for up to a 50 year return period in order to assess the changes induced by the ADC method. After getting a longer data series, further analysis could be done to forecast the maximum flow to up to 1000 years, which could serve as design flow for different infrastructure.",https://doi.org/10.3390/hydrology6030076,10.3390/hydrology6030076,"Ouedraogo, Wendso Awa Agathe; Gathenya, John Mwangi; Raude, James Messo",HYDROLOGY,extreme wet rainfall; peak flows; regional climate models; advanced delta change,BIAS CORRECTION; BASIN; STABILIZATION; PRECIPITATION; SIMULATIONS; PERFORMANCE; SCENARIOS; PATHWAY,,MDPI,BASEL,"ST ALBAN-ANLAGE 66, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND",,2306-5338,,HYDROLOGY-BASEL,Hydrology,SEP,2019,6,3,,,76,
328,A back-fitting algorithm to improve real-time flood forecasting,"Real-time flood forecasting is important for decision-making with regards to flood control and disaster reduction. The conventional approach involves a postprocessor calibration strategy that first calibrates the hydrological model and then estimates errors. This procedure can simulate streamflow consistent with observations, but obtained parameters are not optimal. Joint calibration strategies address this issue by refining hydrological model parameters jointly with the autoregressive (AR) model. In this study, five alternative schemes are used to forecast floods. Scheme I uses only the hydrological model, while scheme II includes an AR model for error correction. In scheme III, differencing is used to remove non-stationarity in the error series. A joint inference strategy employed in scheme IV calibrates the hydrological and AR models simultaneously. The back-fitting algorithm, a basic approach for training an additive model, is adopted in scheme V to alternately recalibrate hydrological and AR model parameters. The performance of the five schemes is compared with a case study of 15 recorded flood events from China's Baiyunshan reservoir basin. Our results show that (1) schemes IV and V outperform scheme III during the calibration and validation periods and (2) scheme V is inferior to scheme IV in the calibration period, but provides better results in the validation period. Joint calibration strategies can therefore improve the accuracy of flood forecasting. Additionally, the back-fitting recalibration strategy produces weaker overcorrection and a more robust performance compared with the joint inference strategy.",https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jhydrol.2018.04.051,10.1016/j.jhydrol.2018.04.051,"Zhang, Xiaojing; Liu, Pan; Cheng, Lei; Liu, Zhangjun; Zhao, Yan",JOURNAL OF HYDROLOGY,Real-time flood forecasting; Error updating; Back-fitting algorithm; Recalibration,DATA ASSIMILATION; XINANJIANG MODEL; UPDATING MODELS; NEURAL-NETWORK; RUNOFF MODEL; UNCERTAINTY; COMBINATION; AUTOCORRELATION; SYSTEM; JOINT,,ELSEVIER,AMSTERDAM,"RADARWEG 29, 1043 NX AMSTERDAM, NETHERLANDS",0022-1694,1879-2707,,J HYDROL,J.

329,Multivariate remotely sensed and in-situ data assimilation for enhancing community WRF-Hydro model forecasting,"Flood is one of the most catastrophic natural disasters in the United States, particularly in the Southeast states where hurricanes and tropical storms are most prevalent, causing billions of dollars in damage annually and significant losses of life and property. The Weather Research and Forecasting Hydrological model (WRF-Hydro) is a community-based hydrologic model designed to improve the skill of hydrometeorological forecasts, such as river discharge, through simulating hydrologic prognostic (e.g., soil moisture) and diagnostic (e.g., energy fluxes) variables. These quantities are potentially biased or erroneous due to the uncertainties involved in all layers of hydrologic predictions. In this study, we use an ensemble based Data Assimilation (DA) approach to explore the benefit of independently and jointly assimilating remotely sensed SMAP (Soil Moisture Active Passive) soil moisture (at different spatial resolutions) and USGS streamflow observations to improve the accuracy and reliability of WRF-Hydro model predictions while accounting for uncertainties. This study is conducted over a large region near to Houston, Texas where heavy rainfall from hurricane Harvey caused flooding in 2017. Before implementing DA, we first calibrated the WRF-Hydro model parameters using four United States Geological Survey (USGS) stream gauges installed within the watershed. In this step, we identified the most dominant model parameters, which were used later in the development of joint state-parameter DA. The findings of this study showed that the multivariate assimilation of soil moisture and streamflow observations results in improved prediction of stream flow as compared to univariate assimilation configurations and regardless of the watershed's streamflow regime. The results also revealed that, during the normal streamflow condition, assimilation of downscaled SMAP soil moisture at 1 km spatial resolution, would improve the accuracy of streamflow simulation more than the assimilation of coarse resolution products (i.e., the native SMAP at 36 km spatial resolution and its interpolated version at 9 km spatial resolution). However, during the period of hurricane Harvey, the soil moisture observations at different resolutions showed a similar impact on improving the streamflow prediction.",https://doi.org/10.1016/j.advwatres.2020.103721,10.1016/j.advwatres.2020.103721,"Abbaszadeh, Peyman; Gavahi, Keyhan; Moradkhani, Hamid",ADVANCES IN WATER RESOURCES,Flood prediction; WRF-Hydro; Data assimilation; SMAP soil moisture,SOIL-MOISTURE PRODUCT; ENSEMBLE KALMAN FILTER; PARTICLE FILTER; CLIMATE-CHANGE; SEQUENTIAL ASSIMILATION; EXTREME RAINFALL; STREAMFLOW; CALIBRATION; EVAPOTRANSPIRATION; UNCERTAINTY,,ELSEVIER SCI LTD,OXFORD,"THE BOULEVARD, LANGFORD LANE, KIDLINGTON, OXFORD OX5 1GB, OXON, ENGLAND",0309-1708,1872-9657,,ADV WATER RESOUR,Adv.

330,Comparison of daily streamflow forecasts using extreme learning machines and the random forest method,"Daily streamflow forecasting is a challenging and essential task for water resource management. The main goal of this study was to compare the accuracy of five data-driven models: extreme learning machine (basic ELM), extreme learning machine with kernels (ELM-kernel), random forest (RF), back-propagation neural network (BPNN) and support vector machine (SVR). The results show that the ELM-kernel model provided a superior alternative to the other models, and the basic ELM model had the poorest performance. To further evaluate the predictive capacities of the five models, the estimations of low flow and high flow in the testing dataset were compared. The RF model was slightly superior to the other models in predicting the peak flows, and the ELM-kernel model showed the highest prediction precision of low flows. There was no single model that showed obvious advantages over the other models in this study. Therefore, further exploration is required for the hydrological forecasting problems.",https://doi.org/10.1080/02626667.2019.1680846,10.1080/02626667.2019.1680846,"Li, Xue; Sha, Jian; Wang, Zhong-Liang",HYDROLOGICAL SCIENCES JOURNAL-JOURNAL DES SCIENCES HYDROLOGIQUES,extreme learning machine; kernel; random forest; daily streamflow forecast,SUPPORT VECTOR MACHINE; PARTICLE SWARM OPTIMIZATION; ARTIFICIAL NEURAL-NETWORK; WEI RIVER-BASIN; RANDOM FEATURES; CLIMATE-CHANGE; REGRESSION; PREDICTION; MODELS; FLOW,,TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD,ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OR14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0262-6667,2150-3435,,HYDROLOG SCI J,Hydrol.

331,Complex relationship between seasonal streamflow forecast skill and value in reservoir operations,"Considerable research effort has recently been directed at improving and operationalising ensemble seasonal streamflow forecasts. Whilst this creates new opportunities for improving the performance of water resources systems, there may also be associated risks. Here, we explore these potential risks by examining the sensitivity of forecast value (improvement in system performance brought about by adopting forecasts) to changes in the forecast skill for a range of hypothetical reservoir designs with contrasting operating objectives. Forecast-informed operations are simulated using rolling horizon, adaptive control and then benchmarked against optimised control rules to assess performance improvements. Results show that there exists a strong relationship between forecast skill and value for systems operated to maintain a target water level. But this relationship breaks down when the reservoir is operated to satisfy a target demand for water; good forecast accuracy does not necessarily translate into performance improvement. We show that the primary cause of this behaviour is the buffering role played by storage in water supply reservoirs, which renders the forecast superfluous for long periods of the operation. System performance depends primarily on forecast accuracy when critical decisions are made - namely during severe drought. As it is not possible to know in advance if a forecast will perform well at such moments, we advocate measuring the consistency of forecast performance, through bootstrap resampling, to indicate potential usefulness in storage operations. Our results highlight the need for sensitivity assess-ment in value-of-forecast studies involving reservoirs with supply objectives.",https://doi.org/10.5194/hess-21-4841-2017,10.5194/hess-21-4841-2017,"Turner, Sean W.

332,Forecasting industrial water demand in Huaihe River Basin due to environmental changes,"A framework is proposed for forecasting industrial water demand in the context of climate change, economic growth, and technological development. The framework was tested in five sub-basins of Huaihe River of China, namely Upstream of Huaihe River (UH), Middlestream of Huaihe River (MH), Downstream of Huaihe River (DH), Yishusi River (YSSR), and Coastal River of Shandong Peninsula (CSP) to project future changes in industrial water demand under different environment change scenarios. Results showed that industrial water demand in Huaihe River basin will increase in the range of 10 to 44.6% due to economic development, water-saving technological advances, and climate change. The highest increase was projected by general circulation model (GCM) BCC-CSM1-1 (179.16 x 108 m(3)) and the lowest by GCM GISS-E2-R (132.4 x 10(8) m(3)) in 2020, while the GCM BNU-ESM projected the highest increase (190.57 x 10(8) m(3)) and GCM CNRM-CM5 the lowest (160.41 x 10(8) m(3)) in 2030. Among the different sub-basins, the highest increase was projected in MH sub-basin where industrial water demand is already very high. On the other hand, the lowest increase in industrial water demand was projected in UH sub-basin. The rapid growth of high water-consuming industries and increased water demand for cooling due to temperature rise are the major causes of the sharp increase in industrial water demand in the basin. The framework developed in the study can be used for reliable forecasting of industrial water demand which in turn can help in selection of an appropriate water management strategy for adaptation to global environmental changes.",https://doi.org/10.1007/s11027-017-9744-1,10.1007/s11027-017-9744-1,"Wang, Xiao-jun; Zhang, Jian-yun; Shahid, Shamsuddin; Bi, Shou-hai; Elmahdi, Amgad; Liao, Chuan-hua; Li, You-de",MITIGATION AND ADAPTATION STRATEGIES FOR GLOBAL CHANGE,Water demand forecasting; Climate change; Industrial water use; Water resources management; Huaihe River basin,CLIMATE; MANAGEMENT,,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",1381-2386,1573-1596,,MITIG ADAPT STRAT GL,Mitig.

333,Data-driven models for predicting microbial water quality in the drinking water source using E. coli monitoring and hydrometeorological data,"Rapid changes in microbial water quality in surface waters pose challenges for production of safe drinking water. If not treated to an acceptable level, microbial pathogens present in the drinking water can result in severe consequences for public health. The aim of this paper was to evaluate the suitability of data-driven models of different complexity for predicting the concentrations of E. coli in the river Gota lilv at the water intake of the drinking water treatment plant in Gothenburg, Sweden. The objectives were to (i) assess how the complexity of the model affects the model performance; and (ii) identify relevant factors and assess their effect as predictors of E. coli levels. To forecast E. coli levels one day ahead, the data on laboratory measurements of E. coli and total coliforms, Colifast measurements of E. coli, water temperature, turbidity, precipitation, and water flow were used. The baseline approaches included Exponential Smoothing and ARIMA (Autoregressive Integrated Moving Average), which are commonly used univariate methods, and a naive baseline that used the previous observed value as its next prediction. Also, models common in the machine learning domain were included: LASSO (Least Absolute Shrinkage and Selection Operator) Regression and Random Forest, and a tool for optimising machine learning pipelines - TPOT (Tree-based Pipeline Optimization Tool). Also, a multivariate autoregressive model VAR (Vector Autoregression) was included. The models that included multiple predictors performed better than univariate models. Random Forest and TPOT resulted in higher performance but showed a tendency of overfitting. Water temperature, microbial concentrations upstream and at the water intake, and precipitation upstream were shown to be important predictors. Data-driven modelling enables water producers to interpret the measurements in the context of what concentrations can be expected based on the recent historic data, and thus identify unexplained deviations warranting further investigation of their origin.

334,Improving estimates and forecasts of lake carbon dynamics using data assimilation,"Lakes are biogeochemical hotspots on the landscape, contributing significantly to the global carbon cycle despite their small areal coverage. Observations and models of lake carbon pools and fluxes are rarely explicitly combined through data assimilation despite successful use of this technique in other fields. Data assimilation adds value to both observations and models by constraining models with observations of the system and by leveraging knowledge of the system formalized by the model to objectively fill observation gaps. In this article, we highlight the utility of data assimilation in lake carbon cycling research by using the ensemble Kalman filter to combine simple lake carbon models with observations of lake carbon pools and fluxes. We demonstrate that data assimilation helps reduce uncertainty in estimates of lake carbon pools and fluxes and more accurately estimate the true carbon pool size compared to estimates derived from observations alone. Data assimilation techniques should be embraced as valuable tools for lake biogeochemists interested in learning about ecosystem dynamics and forecasting ecosystem states and processes.",https://doi.org/10.1002/lom3.10302,10.1002/lom3.10302,"Zwart, Jacob A.; Hararuk, Oleksandra; Prairie, Yves T.; Jones, Stuart E.; Solomon, Christopher T.",LIMNOLOGY AND OCEANOGRAPHY-METHODS,,DISSOLVED ORGANIC-CARBON; NORTH-TEMPERATE; COVARIANCE INFLATION; ECOSYSTEM METABOLISM; RESIDENCE TIME; MODEL; WATER; PHYTOPLANKTON; VARIABILITY; REACTIVITY,,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",1541-5856,,,LIMNOL OCEANOGR-METH,Limnol.

335,"Water quality prediction based on recurrent neural network and improved evidence theory: a case study of Qiantang River, China","Water quality prediction is an effective method for managing and protecting water resources by providing an early warning against water quality deterioration. In general, the existing water quality prediction methods are based on a single shallow model which fails to capture the long-term dependence in historical time series and is more likely to cause a high rate of false alarms and false negatives in practical water monitoring application. To resolve these problems, a new model combining recurrent neural network (RNN) with improved Dempster/Shafer (D-S) evidence theory (RNNs-DS) is proposed in this paper. Among them, the RNNs which can handle the long-term dependence in historical time series effectively are used to realize the preliminary prediction of water quality. And the improved D-S evidence theory is used to synthesize the prediction results of RNNs. In addition, an improved strategy based on correlation analysis method is presented for evidence theory to obtain the number of evidence, which reduces uncertainty in evidence selection effectively. Besides, a new basic probability assignment function which based on modified softmax function is proposed. The new function can effectively solve the problems of weight allocation failure in the traditional function. Then, data about permanganate index, pH, total phosphorus, and dissolved oxygen from Jiuxishuichang monitoring station near Qiantang River, Zhejiang Province, China is used to verify the proposed model. Compared with support vector regression (SVR) and backpropagation neural network (BPNN) and three RNN models, the new model shows higher accuracy and better stability as indicated by four indices. Finally, the engineering application of the RNNs-DS algorithm has been realized on the self-developed water environmental monitoring and forecasting system, which can provide effective support for early risk assessment and prevention in water environment.",https://doi.org/10.1007/s11356-019-05116-y,10.1007/s11356-019-05116-y,"Li, Lei; Jiang, Peng; Xu, Huan; Lin, Guang; Guo, Dong; Wu, Hui",ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE AND POLLUTION RESEARCH,Recurrent neural network; Evidence theory; Water quality prediction; Temporal correlation analysis; Multiscale predictions; Support vector regression; Backpropagation neural network,SHAFER EVIDENCE THEORY; MODEL; CLASSIFICATION; PARAMETERS; ALGORITHM; FUSION; JAPAN,,SPRINGER HEIDELBERG,HEIDELBERG,"TIERGARTENSTRASSE 17, D-69121 HEIDELBERG, GERMANY",0944-1344,1614-7499,,ENVIRON SCI POLLUT R,Environ.

The fulfilment of such complex forecasting chains can allow obtaining information of the most plausible scenarios of water and risk management up to 96 hours ahead. In the present work, flood forecasting was carried out for different events in the upper La Muga basin (including the reservoir), within the European project Flood Risk Assessment and Management in the Pyrenees (http://pgriepm.eu/). The main purpose of the project was to develop a method to optimize the management of flood scenarios in order to minimize the flood risk while maximizing the water resources. The good fit of all the models, obtaining the forecasting rainfall and converting the overland flow in water levels in the reservoir, can give tools and important information to the authorities or dam managers for suitable management during the extreme rainfall and flood events.",https://doi.org/10.1051/e3sconf/20184006028,10.1051/e3sconf/20184006028,"Sanz-Ramos, Marcos; Amengual, Arnau; Blade, Ernest; Romero, Romu; Roux, Helene",NINTH INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE ON FLUVIAL HYDRAULICS (RIVER FLOW 2018),,SHALLOW-WATER EQUATIONS; CONVECTION; SIMULATIONS,,E D P SCIENCES,CEDEX A,"17 AVE DU HOGGAR PARC D ACTIVITES COUTABOEUF BP 112, F-91944 CEDEX A, FRANCE",2267-1242,,,E3S WEB CONF,,,2018,40,,,,6028,
337,Variational assimilation of streamflow data in distributed flood forecasting,"Data assimilation has the potential to improve flood forecasting. However, research efforts are still needed for an effective development of assimilation schemes suitable for operational usage, especially in case of distributed hydrologic models. This work presents a new assimilation system of streamflow data from multiple locations in a distributed hydrologic model. The system adopts a mixed variational-Monte Carlo approach, and is here tested with the hydrologic model MOBIDIC, that is part of the operational flood forecasting chain for Arno river in central Italy. The main objective of the work is to evaluate the actual gain that the system can lead to flood predictions in a real-time operational usage. Accordingly, a specifically designed assessment strategy is employed. It is based on several hindcast experiments that include both high flow and false alarm events in the period 2009-2014 in Arno river basin. Results show that the assimilation system can significantly increase the accuracy of flow predictions in respect to open loop simulations in both cases. Specific performances depend on location and event, but in the majority of cases the error on predicted peak flow is reduced of more than 50% with a lead time of around 10 h. The analysis reveals also that the structure of the hydrologic model, the coherence between observations at various sites, and the initial watershed saturation level, considerably affect the obtainable performances. Conditions that may lead to a worsening of open loop predictions are identified and discussed.",https://doi.org/10.1002/2016WR019208,10.1002/2016WR019208,"Ercolani, Giulia; Castelli, Fabio",WATER RESOURCES RESEARCH,,ENSEMBLE KALMAN FILTER; SENSED SOIL-MOISTURE; RADIOMETRIC SURFACE-TEMPERATURE; HYDROLOGICAL DATA ASSIMILATION; HEAT-FLUX; BOUNDARY-LAYER; PARTICLE FILTER; MODEL; DISCHARGE; SYSTEM,,AMER GEOPHYSICAL UNION,WASHINGTON,"2000 FLORIDA AVE NW, WASHINGTON, DC 20009 USA",0043-1397,1944-7973,,WATER RESOUR RES,Water Resour.

338,A C-vine copula framework to predict daily water temperature in the Yangtze River,"The thermal regime of rivers plays a crucial role in chemical, biological and ecological processes. Effectively predicting water temperature is a key issue related to environment management. This study develops a probabilistic model based on C-vine copulas for water temperature prediction. The proposed framework is applied to forecast daily water temperature in the Yangtze River, considering long-term effects of preceding air temperature and daily discharge. The prediction performance of this framework is compared with the logistic regression model (LogR) and generalized regression neural network (GRNN). The results of this study indicate that the proposed C-vine copula framework and GRNN model provide better forecasting of stream temperature with weak human-related disturbances than LogR model. The outperformance of C-vine framework is reflected by its ability to accurately capture variations in the water temperature greatly affected by the Three Gorges Reservoir (TGR). This steady and reliable framework is further applied for the conservation of Chinese Sturgeon to estimate the range of suggested discharge, given the daily air temperatures, to adjust the water temperature within 18-20 degrees C at Yichang station during the spawning season. This application is verified to be more effective, providing indications for reservoir management to lower water temperatures by regulating river flow to ensure the occurrence of spawning activities. The results of this study may provide a scientific reference for the ecological operation of reservoirs in regulated rivers.",https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jhydrol.2021.126430,10.1016/j.jhydrol.2021.126430,"Tao, Yuwei; Wang, Yuankun; Wang, Dong; Ni, Lingling; Wu, Jichun",JOURNAL OF HYDROLOGY,Water temperature; Prediction; C-vine copula; Three Gorges Reservoir,MODELS; STREAM; REGIME; IMPACTS; DAMS,,ELSEVIER,AMSTERDAM,"RADARWEG 29, 1043 NX AMSTERDAM, NETHERLANDS",0022-1694,1879-2707,,J HYDROL,J.

339,Colorado River water supply is predictable on multi-year timescales owing to long-term ocean memory,"Skillful multi-year climate forecasts provide crucial information for decision-makers and resource managers to mitigate water scarcity, yet such forecasts remain challenging due to unpredictable weather noise and the lack of dynamical model capability. Here we demonstrate that the annual water supply of the Colorado River is predictable up to several years in advance by a drift-free decadal climate prediction system using a fully coupled climate model. Observational analyses and model experiments show that prolonged shortages of water supply in the Colorado River are significantly linked to sea surface temperature precursors including tropical Pacific cooling, North Pacific warming, and southern tropical Atlantic warming. In the Colorado River basin, the water deficits can reduce crop yield and increase wildfire potential. Thus, a multi-year prediction of severe water shortages in the Colorado River basin could be useful as an early indicator of subsequent agricultural loss and wildfire risk. Sea surface temperature anomalies in the Atlantic and Pacific Oceans can help predict water shortages in the Colorado River basin, according to analyses of decadal climate predictions and observations.",https://doi.org/10.1038/s43247-020-00027-0,10.1038/s43247-020-00027-0,"Chikamoto, Yoshimitsu; Wang, S-Y Simon; Yost, Matt; Yocom, Larissa; Gillies, Robert R.",COMMUNICATIONS EARTH & ENVIRONMENT,,UNITED-STATES; DROUGHT; FLOW; VARIABILITY; STREAMFLOW,,SPRINGERNATURE,LONDON,"CAMPUS, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON, N1 9XW, ENGLAND",,2662-4435,,COMMUN EARTH ENVIRON,Commun.

340,"Integrated real-time flood risk identification, analysis, and diagnosis model framework for a multireservoir system considering temporally and spatially dependent forecast uncertainties","Uncertainties in flood forecasts that result from error propagation in meteorological-hydrological simulation processes present spatial and temporal dependences that are the principal sources of risk to real-time flood control in a multireservoir system. Risk analysis models that neglect such dependences potentially yield biased results regarding flood control operations. To enhance the accuracy of flood risk analysis and inform decision making regarding real-time flood control for a multireservoir system, this study proposed an integrated flood risk identification, analysis, and diagnosis model framework that incorporates the multidimensional dependences of forecast uncertainties. The framework includes an uncertainty identification model that uses the copula function to characterize the joint probability function of the mixed dependent uncertainties. It also incorporates a realtime flood risk analysis module that couples simulation and optimization to convert the complex multiobjective operation under uncertainty into a tractable model capable of flexibly evaluating individual and joint flood risks. The third component is a risk diagnosis module that calculates risk contributions using conditional probability, and identifies stable and vulnerable reservoirs within the system to alter operational decisions toward risk reduction. Methodologies were verified through application to a mixed four-reservoir system in the Pi River Basin, China. The principal findings were as follows. (1) Positive-dominated dependences of forecast uncertainties were identified because of error propagation through the meteorological and rainfall-runoff forecasts within the spatial and temporal continuity connection, and the copula function accurately described and quantified the multidimensional temporal and spatial dependences of the uncertainties. (2) In neglecting the spatial dependences of forecast uncertainties, the joint flood risk of the reservoir system was underestimated; in ignoring high-order temporal dependences, individual flood risk was underestimated owing to biased estimation in error variance. (3) Systematic reorganization of the operational strategies of diagnosed stable and vulnerable reservoirs could provide guidance for reduction and homogenization of flood risks. The proposed framework could be used to improve the accuracy of flood risk analysis and support reliable real-time flood control operation of a multireservoir system.",https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jhydrol.2021.126679,10.1016/j.jhydrol.2021.126679,"Xu, Bin; Huang, Xin; Mo, Ran; Zhong, Ping-an; Lu, Qingwen; Zhang, Hanwen; Si, Wei; Xiao, Jianfeng; Sun, Yu",JOURNAL OF HYDROLOGY,Reservoir operation; Uncertainty; Flood risk analysis; Diagnosis; Copula function; Markov chain,DECISION-MAKING; COPULA; OPERATION; EVOLUTION,,ELSEVIER,AMSTERDAM,"RADARWEG 29, 1043 NX AMSTERDAM, NETHERLANDS",0022-1694,1879-2707,,J HYDROL,J.

341,Forecasting of Groundwater Level using Artificial Neural Network by incorporating river recharge and river bank infiltration,"Groundwater tables forecasting during implemented river bank infiltration (RBI) method is important to identify adequate storage of groundwater aquifer for water supply purposes. This study illustrates the development and application of artificial neural networks (ANNs) to predict groundwater tables in two vertical wells located in confined aquifer adjacent to the Langat River. ANN model was used in this study is based on the long period forecasting of daily groundwater tables. ANN models were carried out to predict groundwater tables for 1 day ahead at two different geological materials. The input to the ANN models consider of daily rainfall, river stage, water level, stream flow rate, temperature and groundwater level. Two different type of ANNs structure were used to predict the fluctuation of groundwater tables and compared the best forecasting values. The performance of different models structure of the ANN is used to identify the fluctuation of the groundwater table and provide acceptable predictions. Dynamics prediction and time series of the system can be implemented in two possible ways of modelling. The coefficient correlation (R), Mean Square Error (MSE), Root Mean Square Error (RMSE) and coefficient determination (R-2) were chosen as the selection criteria of the best model. The statistical values for DW1 are 0.8649, 0.0356, 0.01, and 0.748 respectively. While for DW2 the statistical values are 0.7392, 0.0781, 0.0139, and 0.546 respectively. Based on these results, it clearly shows that accurate predictions can be achieved with time series 1-day ahead of forecasting groundwater table and the interaction between river and aquifer can be examine. The findings of the study can be used to assist policy marker to manage groundwater resources by using RBI method.",https://doi.org/10.1051/matecconf/201710304007,10.1051/matecconf/201710304007,"Shamsuddin, Mohd Khairul Nizar; Kusin, Faradiella Mohd; Sulaiman, Wan Nor Azmin; Ramli, Mohammad Firuz; Baharuddin, Mohamad Faizal Tajul; Adnan, Mohd Shalahuddin",INTERNATIONAL SYMPOSIUM ON CIVIL AND ENVIRONMENTAL ENGINEERING 2016 (ISCEE 2016),,FILTRATION; MODEL; WELL,,E D P SCIENCES,CEDEX A,"17 AVE DU HOGGAR PARC D ACTIVITES COUTABOEUF BP 112, F-91944 CEDEX A, FRANCE",2261-236X,,,MATEC WEB CONF,,,2017,103,,,,4007,
342,Seasonal rainfall forecasting for the Yangtze River basin using statistical and dynamical models,"Summer monsoon rainfall forecasting in the Yangtze River basin is highly valuable for water resource management and for the control of floods and droughts. However, improving the accuracy of seasonal forecasting remains a challenge. In this study, a statistical model and four dynamical global circulation models (GCMs) are applied to conduct seasonal rainfall forecasts for the Yangtze River basin. The statistical forecasts are achieved by establishing a linear regression relationship between the sea surface temperature (SST) and rainfall. The dynamical forecasts are achieved by downscaling the rainfall predicted by the four GCMs at the monthly and seasonal scales. Historical data of monthly SST and GCM hindcasts from 1982 to 2010 are used to make the forecast. The results show that the SST-based statistical model generally outperforms the GCM simulations, with higher forecasting accuracy that extends to longer lead times of up to 12 months. The SST statistical model achieves a correlation coefficient up to 0.75 and the lowest mean relative error of 6%. In contrast, the GCMs exhibit a sharply decreasing forecast accuracy with lead times longer than 1 month. Accordingly, the SST statistical model can provide reliable guidance for the seasonal rainfall forecasts in the Yangtze River basin, while the results of GCM simulations could serve as a reference for shorter lead times. Extensive scope exists for further improving the rainfall forecasting accuracy of GCM simulations.",https://doi.org/10.1002/joc.6216,10.1002/joc.6216,"Qian, Shuni; Chen, Jie; Li, Xiangquan; Xu, Chong-Yu; Guo, Shenglian; Chen, Hua; Wu, Xushu",INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF CLIMATOLOGY,GCMs; sea surface temperature; seasonal forecasting; statistical model; teleconnections,SUMMER MONSOON RAINFALL; CLIMATE-CHANGE IMPACTS; MULTIMODEL ENSEMBLE; WINTER RAINFALL; EL-NINO; PRECIPITATION; PREDICTION; PATTERNS; SKILL; VARIABILITY,,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0899-8418,1097-0088,,INT J CLIMATOL,Int.

343,CLIMATE OF WEST SIBERIA DURING THE SLOWING PHASE OF WARMING (1986-2015) AND PREDICTION OF HYDRO CLIMATIC RESOURCES FOR 2021-2030,"The relevance of the study. The most visible affect of the present climate change is the rise of surface air temperature. Regional and local indicators of climate change differ from the global characteristics. Transformation of the hydrological cycle, water balance, river runoff in its turn affects climate processes. In order to predict the response of geosystems and their hydro-climatic resources to climate change it is necessary to have a clear vision of contemporary climate change and its projections for the coming decades in specific geographical localities. The aim of the study is (1) to assess the climate change over West Siberia on the basis of statistical analysis of monthly air temperature and precipitation time series up to 2015, (2) predict the average air temperature and precipitation fields for the 2021-2030, and (3) determine the climate-driven changes in water balance and water flow regime over the study area. The methods used in the study. Analysis and forecasting of spatial and temporal variability of surface air temperature and precipitation rates at meteorological stations in the region are made by statistical methods in the StatSoft STATISTICA package (regression analysis, trend analysis, cluster analysis to classify objects, exponential smoothing and forecasting). The averaged monthly land water balance constituents are determined for the base (1966-1985), current (1986-2015) and forecast (2021-2030) using the method of hydrological and climatical calculations developed by V.S. Mezentsev. The results. It is shown that the modern 30yrs climatic period differs from the previous one in higher energy level (air temperature). Against this background, not only upward but downward temperature trends in some months are observed. The authors have predicted the average temperatures and precipitation rates in a cold season and monthly temperatures and precipitation in a warm season of the year at 31 meteorological stations for 2021-2030. The estimates for the current and forecast periods made it possible to compute the average regime parametres of precipitation, evapotranspiration, runoff and moisture of soil active layer at the meteorological stantions located in different lanscape zones and regions of West Siberian plain. The projected increase in temperature and evapotranspiration does not lead to the expected decrease in flow even in the southern dry regions. At the same time, soil moisture in summer will decrease everywhere.",https://doi.org/,,"Paromov, Vladimir V.; Zemtsov, Valery A.; Kopysov, Sergey G.",BULLETIN OF THE TOMSK POLYTECHNIC UNIVERSITY-GEO ASSETS ENGINEERING,Hydro-climatic resources of geosystems; water balance; Western Siberia; method of hydrological and climatological computations; air temperature; atmospheric precipitation; time series analysis and forecasting,FEATURES; REGIONS; SOIL,,"TOMSK POLYTECHNIC UNIV, PUBLISHING HOUSE",TOMSK,"30, LENIN AVE, TOMSK, 634050, RUSSIA",2500-1019,2413-1830,,BULL TOMSK POLYTECH,Bull.

344,Efficient forecasting model technique for river stream flow in tropical environment,"Monthly stream flow forecasting can provide crucial information on hydrological applications including water resource management and flood mitigation systems. In this statistical study, time series and artificial intelligence methods were evaluated according to implementation of each time-series technique to find an effective tool for stream flow prediction in flood forecasting. This paper explores the application of water level, rainfall data and input time series into three different models; linear regression (LR), auto-regressive integrated moving average (ARIMA) and artificial neural networks (ANN). The performances of the models were compared based on the maximum coefficient of determination (R-2) and minimum root means square error (RMSE). Based on the results the ANN model presents the most accurate measurement, with the R-2 value of 0.868 and 18% RMSE. The present study suggests that ANN is the best model due to its ability to recognise times series patterns and to understand non-linear relationships.",https://doi.org/10.1080/1573062X.2019.1637906,10.1080/1573062X.2019.1637906,"Khairuddin, Nuruljannah; Aris, Ahmad Zaharin; Elshafie, Ahmed; Narany, Tahoora Sheikhy; Ishak, Mohd Yusoff; Isa, Noorain Mohd",URBAN WATER JOURNAL,Linear regression; ARIMA; artificial neural networks; flood forecasting,ARTIFICIAL NEURAL-NETWORKS; WATER-RESOURCES; TEMPORAL-CHANGE; REGRESSION; FUZZY; DISCHARGE; RAINFALL; SYSTEM,,TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD,ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OR14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1573-062X,1744-9006,,URBAN WATER J,Urban Water J.,MAR 16,2019,16,3,183,192,,
345,Forecasting Summer Rainfall and Streamflow over the Yangtze River Valley Using Western Pacific Subtropical High Feature,"The western Pacific subtropical high (WPSH) is one of the key systems affecting the summer rainfall over the Yangtze River Valley in China. In this study, the forecasting capacity of the WPSH for summer rainfall and streamflow is evaluated based on the WPSH index (WPSHI) derived from the NCEP/NCAR reanalysis dataset. It has been found that WPSHI can identify extreme flood years with a higher skill than normal wet years. Specifically, exceedance probability forecasting based on WPSHI has higher skills for higher thresholds of rainfall. For streamflow, adding WPSHI as a predictor only enhances the skill for higher thresholds of streamflow relative to models based on antecedent streamflow. Under the same framework, performances of two postprocessing approaches for dynamical forecasts, i.e., the model output statistics (MOS) approach and the reanalysis-based (RAN) approach are compared. Hindcasts from Climate Forecast System version 2 from the National Center for Environmental Prediction (CFSv2) are used to calculate WPSHI, which is used as the predictor for rainfall and streamflow. The result shows that the RAN approach performs better than the MOS approach. This study emphasizes the fact that the forecasting skill of exceedance probability would largely depend on the selected threshold of the predictand, and this fact should be noticed in future studies in the long-term forecasting field.",https://doi.org/10.3390/w13182580,10.3390/w13182580,"He, Ranran; Chen, Yuanfang; Huang, Qin; Wang, Wenpeng; Li, Guofang",WATER,western Pacific subtropical high; the Yangtze River Valley; model output statistics (MOS); reanalysis-based (RAN) approach,MONSOON; SYSTEM; PRECIPITATION; SIMULATIONS; REGRESSION; OUTPUTS; VECTOR; CHINA; MODEL,,MDPI,BASEL,"ST ALBAN-ANLAGE 66, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND",,2073-4441,,WATER-SUI,Water,SEP,2021,13,18,,,2580,
346,Evaluation of ensemble precipitation forecasts generated through post-processing in a Canadian catchment,"Flooding in Canada is often caused by heavy rainfall during the snowmelt period. Hydrologic forecast centers rely on precipitation forecasts obtained from numerical weather prediction (NWP) models to enforce hydrological models for streamflow forecasting. The uncertainties in raw quantitative precipitation forecasts (QPFs) are enhanced by physiography and orography effects over a diverse landscape, particularly in the western catchments of Canada. A Bayesian post-processing approach called rainfall post-processing (RPP), developed in Australia (Robertson et al., 2013; Shrestha et al., 2015), has been applied to assess its forecast performance in a Canadian catchment. Raw QPFs obtained from two sources, Global Ensemble Forecasting System (GEFS) Reforecast 2 project, from the National Centers for Environmental Prediction, and Global Deterministic Forecast System (GDPS), from Environment and Climate Change Canada, are used in this study. The study period from January 2013 to December 2015 covered a major flood event in Calgary, Alberta, Canada. Post-processed results show that the RPP is able to remove the bias and reduce the errors of both GEFS and GDPS forecasts. Ensembles generated from the RPP reliably quantify the forecast uncertainty.",https://doi.org/10.5194/hess-22-1957-2018,10.5194/hess-22-1957-2018,"Jha, Sanjeev K.; Shrestha, Durga L.; Stadnyk, Tricia A.; Coulibaly, Paulin",HYDROLOGY AND EARTH SYSTEM SCIENCES,,GEOSTATISTICAL APPROACH; TIGGE MULTIMODEL; WEATHER; SPACE; MODEL; PREDICTIONS; SYSTEM,,COPERNICUS GESELLSCHAFT MBH,GOTTINGEN,"BAHNHOFSALLEE 1E, GOTTINGEN, 37081, GERMANY",1027-5606,1607-7938,,HYDROL EARTH SYST SC,Hydrol.

347,Cloud-Fog based framework for drought prediction and forecasting using artificial neural network and genetic algorithm,"Drought is one of the most recurrent natural disasters with cataclysmic effects on water budget, crop production, economic progression and public health. These consequences are magnified by the climate change leading to more intense drought conditions. A number of drought indices have been presented to calibrate the drought severity with its own strengths and limitations. Many of them are region-specific and unable to exhibit the alterations in significant drought inducing elements. Internet of Things (IoT) is well-suited for continuous monitoring, collection and analysis of different environmental phenomena. The dimensionality of the data collected about drought inducing attributes temperature, humidity, precipitation, evapotranspiration, groundwater, soil moisture at different depths, streamflow and season is reduced using PCA (Principal Component Analysis) at fog layer. Cloud layer estimates the drought severity level using Artificial Neural Network (ANN) whose parameters are optimised with Genetic Algorithm (GA) to get more accurate system and ARIMA method is used to forecast the drought for different time frames. Experimentation done on data collected from government websites shows that proposed system performs well in terms of accuracy, sensitivity, specificity, precision and F-measure with values 95.03%, 90.6%, 96.73%, 91.42% and 91.01%.",https://doi.org/10.1080/0952813X.2019.1647563,10.1080/0952813X.2019.1647563,"Kaur, Amandeep; Sood, Sandeep K.",JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL & THEORETICAL ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE,fog computing; cloud computing; ANN-GA (Artificial Neural Network-Genetic Algorithm); Principal Component Analysis (PCA); ARIMA model,RIVER-BASIN; INTERNET; MODEL; IOT,,TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD,ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OR14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0952-813X,1362-3079,,J EXP THEOR ARTIF IN,J.

Unlike existing reservoir modeling software, GRAPS can handle probabilistic streamflow forecasts represented as ensembles for performing multi-reservoir prognostic water allocation and evaluate the reliability of forecast-based allocation with observed streamflow. GRAPS is applied to four linked reservoirs in the Jaguaribe Metropolitan Hydro-System (JMH) in Ceara, North East Brazil. Results from the historical simulation and the zero-inflow policy over the JMH system demonstrate the model's capability to support monthly water allocation and reproduce the observed monthly releases and storages. Additional analyses using streamflow forecast ensembles illustrate GRAP's abilities in developing storage-reliability curves under inflow-forecast uncertainty. Our analyses show that GRAPS is versatile and can be applied for 1) short-term operating policy studies, 2) long-term basin-wide planning evaluations, and 3) climate-information based application studies.",https://doi.org/10.1016/j.envsoft.2020.104802,10.1016/j.envsoft.2020.104802,"Xuan, Yi; Ford, Lucas; Mahinthakumar, Kumar; De Souza Filho, Assis; Lall, Upmanu; Sankarasubramanian, A.",ENVIRONMENTAL MODELLING & SOFTWARE,Reservoir modeling; Software development; Simulation; Optimization; Water resources management,PARTICLE SWARM OPTIMIZATION; WATER-RESOURCES; CLIMATE FORECASTS; MANAGEMENT; SYSTEM; MODEL; PREDICTION; OPERATION,,ELSEVIER SCI LTD,OXFORD,"THE BOULEVARD, LANGFORD LANE, KIDLINGTON, OXFORD OX5 1GB, OXON, ENGLAND",1364-8152,1873-6726,,ENVIRON MODELL SOFTW,Environ.

349,Enhancing robustness of monthly streamflow forecasting model using gated recurrent unit based on improved grey wolf optimizer,"Accurate and reliable mid- to long-term streamflow prediction is essential for water resources management. However, streamflow series exhibits strong non-stationary and non-linear; thus the traditional single model may fail to capture the characteristic of hydrological series and hard to maintain the robustness of the model. To overcome this problem, the application of empirical wavelet transform combined with improved complete ensemble empirical mode decomposition with adaptive noise (ICEEWT) is firstly to eliminate the redundant noise and decompose original series into several components as inputs. Secondly, gated recurrent unit (GRU) is employed to deep learn the relationship between historical streamflow series and those of the future. Finally, balancing underfitting and overfitting the improved grey wolf optimizer (IGWO) is adopted with the hybrid model to identify the approximate parameter combination. The case study is conducted by monthly streamflow data at Shangjingyou station and Fenhe reservoir station in the upper reaches of Fenhe River. In comparison with parallel experiments using extreme learning machine (ELM) and least squares support vector machine (LSSVM), the validation results demonstrate that the GRU model can exhibit satisfactory performance in monthly streamflow forecasting. Moreover, the standard GRU model is further improved by IGWO, which consistently remains the performance of in-sample and out-sample. The proposed model ICEEWT-IGWO-GRU is superior to the single GRU model average reducing MAE and RMSE by 50% and 52% for two stations, which indicates its superiority with a more robust prediction.",https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jhydrol.2021.126607,10.1016/j.jhydrol.2021.126607,"Zhao, Xuehua; Lv, Hanfang; Lv, Shujin; Sang, Yuting; Wei, Yizhao; Zhu, Xueping",JOURNAL OF HYDROLOGY,Streamflow prediction; Gated recurrent unit; Empirical wavelet transform; Improved complete ensemble empirical mode decomposition with adaptive noise; Grey wolf optimizer,EXTREME LEARNING-MACHINE; SUPPORT VECTOR MACHINE; NEURAL-NETWORK; HYBRID MODEL; DECOMPOSITION; PREDICTION; RUNOFF; ALGORITHM; AREA; SVM,,ELSEVIER,AMSTERDAM,"RADARWEG 29, 1043 NX AMSTERDAM, NETHERLANDS",0022-1694,1879-2707,,J HYDROL,J.

350,Verification of Upper Citarum River Discharge Prediction Using Climate Forecast System Version 2 (CFSv2) Output,"Citarum River serves as a water supplier for the main reservoir in West Java, namely Saguling Reservoir. The river discharge prediction is important for reservoir operations and flood control. This study investigated the usefulness of Climate Forecast System Version 2 (CFSv2) data output to predict the Upper Citarum discharge. We statistically downscaled the CFSv2 output to derive the local climate prediction and then incorporated the result to hydrological model to obtain the discharge prediction. The statistical downscaling method used in this research is Multi Windows Constructed Analogue (CA) method using velocity potential (chi) and stream function (psi) at 850 hPa as predictors and daily rainfall as predictand. The windows used are Australian Monsoon Index (AUSMI) and Western North Pacific Monsoon Index (WNPMI). The daily rainfall prediction was then used as an input for the Soil and Water Assessment Toll (SWAT) hydrological model to generate discharge prediction in the Upper Citarum basin. In this study, we investigated how well the prediction system predict low discharge event of <54.8 m(3)/s which influences the turbine movement in Saguling Power House. Our verifications were done in the period of December-January-February 2011 -2016, using Brier Score and Brier Skill Score. The result showed that CFSv2 is able to represent the event of low discharge event that occurs for 10 to 14 days in one month with good accuracy and skill. In addition, the prediction system has a fairly good accuracy in predicting high discharge categories in the same period, so it can also be used as information to mitigate the occurrence of high discharge that will cause flooding.",https://doi.org/10.1063/1.5047325,10.1063/1.5047325,"Lestari, Luh Putu Pradiptianti; Arya, Doni Khaira; Suwarman, Rusmawan; Syahputra, Muhammad Ridho",INTERNATIONAL SYMPOSIUM ON EARTH HAZARD AND DISASTER MITIGATION (ISEDM) 2017,Discharge Prediction; Statistical Downscaling; Constructed Analogue Multi-windows; Hydrological Model; Brier Score,,,AMER INST PHYSICS,MELVILLE,"2 HUNTINGTON QUADRANGLE, STE 1NO1, MELVILLE, NY 11747-4501 USA",0094-243X,,978-0-7354-1703-8,AIP CONF PROC,,,2018,1987,,,,20040,
351,Does Including Soil Moisture Observations Improve Operational Streamflow Forecasts in Snow-Dominated Watersheds?,"Changing climate and growing water demand are increasing the need for robust streamflow forecasts. Historically, operational streamflow forecasts made by the Natural Resources Conservation Service have relied on precipitation and snow water equivalent observations from Snow Telemetry (SNOTEL) sites. We investigate whether also including SNOTEL soil moisture observations improve April-July streamflow volume forecast accuracy at 0, 1, 2, and 3-month lead times at 12 watersheds in Utah and California. We found statistically significant improvement in 0 and 3-month lead time accuracy in 8 of 12 watersheds and 10 of 12 watersheds for 1 and 2-month lead times. Surprisingly, these improvements were insensitive to soil moisture metrics derived from soil physical properties. Forecasts were made with volumetric water content (VWC) averaged from October 1 to the forecast date. By including VWC at the 0-month lead time the forecasts explained 7.3% more variability and increased the streamflow volume accuracy by 8.4% on average compared to standard forecasts that already explained an average 77% of the variability. At 1 to 3-month lead times, the inclusion of soil moisture explained 12.3-26.3% more variability than the standard forecast on average. Our findings indicate including soil moisture observations increased statistical streamflow forecast accuracy and thus, could potentially improve water supply reliability in regions affected by changing snowpacks.",https://doi.org/10.1111/1752-1688.12490,10.1111/1752-1688.12490,"Harpold, Adrian A.; Sutcliffe, Kent; Clayton, Jordan; Goodbody, Angus; Vazquez, Shareily",JOURNAL OF THE AMERICAN WATER RESOURCES ASSOCIATION,snow hydrology; streamflow; surface water hydrology; soil moisture; monitoring; statistics; water supply,EXTREME SNOWFALL; RIVER-BASIN; VARIABILITY; RUNOFF; GENERATION; PREDICTABILITY; RAINFALL; STATES; SITES; SCALE,,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",1093-474X,1752-1688,,J AM WATER RESOUR AS,J.

352,Streamflow forecasting using extreme gradient boosting model coupled with Gaussian mixture model,"The establishment of an accurate and reliable forecasting model is important for water resource planning and management. In this study, we developed a hybrid model (namely GMM-XGBoost), coupling extreme gradient boosting (XGBoost) with Gaussian mixture model (GMM), for monthly streamflow forecasting. The proposed model is based on the principle of modular model, where a complex problem is divided into several simple ones. GMM was applied to cluster streamflow into several groups, using the features selected by a tree-based method. Then, each group was used to fit several single XGBoosts. And the prediction is a weighted average of the single models. Monthly streamflow data at Cuntan and Hankou stations on Yangtze River Basin were used to evaluate the performance of the proposed model. To compare the forecasting efficiency, support vector machine (SVM) and standalone XGBoost were selected as the benchmark models. The results indicated that although all three models yielded quite good performance on one-month ahead forecasting with high Nash-Sutclitte efficiency coefficient (NSE) and low root mean squared error (RMSE), GMM-XGBoost provided the best accuracy with significant improvement of forecasting accuracy. It can be inferred from the results that (1) XGBoost is applicable for streamflow forecasting, and in general, performs better than SVM; (2) the cluster analysis-based modular model is helpful in improving accuracy and capturing the complicated patterns of hydrological process; (3) the proposed GMM-XGBoost model is a superior alternative, which can provide accurate and reliable predictions for optimal water resources management.",https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jhydrol.2020.124901,10.1016/j.jhydrol.2020.124901,"Ni, Lingling; Wang, Dong; Wu, Jianfeng; Wang, Yuankun; Tao, Yuwei; Zhang, Jianyun; Liu, Jiufu",JOURNAL OF HYDROLOGY,Streamflow forecasting; Extreme gradient boosting; Gaussian mixture model; Modular models,SHORT-TERM-MEMORY; GLOBAL SOLAR-RADIATION; WATER-RESOURCES; PREDICTION; DECOMPOSITION; MACHINE; PRECIPITATION; REGRESSION; MULTIMODEL; SKILL,,ELSEVIER,AMSTERDAM,"RADARWEG 29, 1043 NX AMSTERDAM, NETHERLANDS",0022-1694,1879-2707,,J HYDROL,J.

353,Dynamic long-term streamflow probabilistic forecasting model for a multisite system considering real-time forecast updating through spatio-temporal dependent error correction,"Long-term streamflow forecasting for a multisite river basin system can experience oscillation of spatio-temporal dependent forecast errors. Characterizing the dependent information and conducting spatio-temporal dependent forecast error correction can reduce the total uncertainty in real-time forecasting. On the basis of a single-site martingale model of forecast evolution (MMFE), which can simulate forecast uncertainty evolution over the temporal scale, this study developed a dynamic long-term streamflow probabilistic forecasting model that addresses spatio-temporal dependent error correction for a multisite system. Error characteristics and hybrid spatiotemporal forecast improvements with complex dependencies are captured by Copula function, which describes the systemwide evolution of forecast uncertainty. The proposed model was verified by forecasting the streamflow of the Hongze Lake-Luoma Lake system in China. The results revealed the following. 1) The spatio-temporal dependent error correction based on MMFE can refine the spatio-temporal dimension hybrid error information, which is helpful in improving forecast accuracy. 2) As the spatio-temporal dependence of forecast uncertainty is described using a Copula function, selection of the marginal distribution and connection function is flexible through combining statistical and informational characteristics of the errors, which is helpful in improving the fittedness of complex system error simulation. 3) Compared with the benchmark forecast model without correction, the proposed model greatly decreased forecast uncertainty by reducing the standard deviation of the errors, continuous ranked probability score (CRPS), and Brier score (BS) by nearly 40%, 11.4%, and 34.6%, respectively, and further reduce the CRPS by 2.1% on average (highest value: 3.7%) and reduce the BS by 1.2% on average (highest value: 2.0%) in comparison with only temporal correction. The results demonstrate that the proposed model improves the accuracy and reliability of probabilistic streamflow forecasting for complex water resource systems by reducing uncertainty.",https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jhydrol.2021.126666,10.1016/j.jhydrol.2021.126666,"Mo, Ran; Xu, Bin; Zhong, Ping-an; Zhu, Feilin; Huang, Xin; Liu, Weifeng; Xu, Sunyu; Wang, Guoqing; Zhang, Jianyun",JOURNAL OF HYDROLOGY,Long-term streamflow forecast; Forecast uncertainties; Martingale model of forecast evolution; Spatio-temporal dependent error correction,UNCERTAINTY EVOLUTION; STOCHASTIC SIMULATION; FLOOD; COPULA; PREDICTION; SERIES,,ELSEVIER,AMSTERDAM,"RADARWEG 29, 1043 NX AMSTERDAM, NETHERLANDS",0022-1694,1879-2707,,J HYDROL,J.

354,"Turbidity prediction of lake-type raw water using random forest model based on meteorological data: A case study of Tai lake, China","Turbidity is an indication of water quality and enables the growth of pathogenic microorganisms. For drinking water treatment plants (DWTPs), violent fluctuations in turbidity are highly disruptive to operational performance due to the lag in process parameter adjustments. Such risks must be carefully managed to guarantee safe drinking water. Machine learning techniques have been proven to be effective for modeling complex nonlinear environmental systems, and this study adopted such a technique to develop a model for predicting source water turbidity for DWTPs to allow DWTPs to make proactive interventions in advance. A random forest (RF) model used preprocessed (empirical mode decomposition and quartile rejecting) meteorological factors (wind speed, wind direction, air temperature, and rainfall) as the input variables, to establish the turbidity prediction of a lake with significant turbidity in China's South Tai Lake. The modeling process included four main stages: (1) source data analysis, (2) raw data preprocessing, (3) modeling and tuning, and (4) model evaluation. The results of the RF model indicated that the correlation coefficient between the predicted and actual sequences is over 0.7, and more than 55% of the predicted values could control the errors within 20% compared to the actual measured values, suggesting that machine learning techniques are suitable for predicting the turbidity of raw source water. It was found that the RF model can provide a modest performance boost because of its stronger capacity to capture nonlinear interactions in the data. The findings of this study can inform the development of turbidity prediction models using readily available meteorological forecast data. The model can be applied to other DWTPs using similar shallow lakes as water sources.",https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jenvman.2021.112657,10.1016/j.jenvman.2021.112657,"Zhang, Yiping; Yao, Xinyu; Wu, Qiang; Huang, Yongbin; Zhou, Zhixu; Yang, Jun; Liu, Xiaowei",JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL MANAGEMENT,Machine learning technique; Wind field; Shallow lake; Drinking water source; Data-driven model,NEURAL-NETWORKS; RIVER-BASIN; VARIABLES,,ACADEMIC PRESS LTD- ELSEVIER SCIENCE LTD,LONDON,"24-28 OVAL RD, LONDON NW1 7DX, ENGLAND",0301-4797,1095-8630,,J ENVIRON MANAGE,J.

This work catalogs the various pathways of ensemble streamflow forecasting based on an exhaustive review of more than 700 studies over the last 40 years. We focus on the advanced state of the art in the model-based (dynamical) ensemble forecasting approaches. Ensemble streamflow prediction systems are categorized into three leading classes: statistics-based streamflow prediction systems, climatology-based ensemble streamflow prediction systems and numerical weather prediction-based hydrological ensemble prediction systems. For each ensemble approach, technical information, as well as details about its strengths and weaknesses, are provided based on a critical review of the studies listed. Through this literature review, the performance and uncertainty associated with the ensemble forecasting systems are underlined from both operational and scientific viewpoints. Finally, the remaining key challenges and prospective future research directions are presented, notably through hybrid dynamical - statistical learning approaches, which obviously present new challenges to be overcome in order to allow the successful employment of ensemble streamflow forecasting systems in the next decades.

356,"Seasonal drought ensemble predictions based on multiple climate models in the upper Han River Basin, China","An experimental seasonal drought forecasting system is developed based on 29-year (1982-2010) seasonal meteorological hindcasts generated by the climate models from the North American Multi-Model Ensemble (NMME) project. This system made use of a bias correction and spatial downscaling method, and a distributed time-variant gain model (DTVGM) hydrologic model. DTVGM was calibrated using observed daily hydrological data and its streamflow simulations achieved Nash-Sutcliffe efficiency values of 0.727 and 0.724 during calibration (1978-1995) and validation (1996-2005) periods, respectively, at the Danjiangkou reservoir station. The experimental seasonal drought forecasting system (known as NMME-DTVGM) is used to generate seasonal drought forecasts. The forecasts were evaluated against the reference forecasts (i.e., persistence forecast and climatological forecast). The NMME-DTVGM drought forecasts have higher detectability and accuracy and lower false alarm rate than the reference forecasts at different lead times (from 1 to 4 months) during the cold-dry season. No apparent advantage is shown in drought predictions during spring and summer seasons because of a long memory of the initial conditions in spring and a lower predictive skill for precipitation in summer. Overall, the NMME-based seasonal drought forecasting system has meaningful skill in predicting drought several months in advance, which can provide critical information for drought preparedness and response planning as well as the sustainable practice of water resource conservation over the basin.",https://doi.org/10.1007/s00382-017-3577-1,10.1007/s00382-017-3577-1,"Ma, Feng; Ye, Aizhong; Duan, Qingyun",CLIMATE DYNAMICS,Seasonal drought forecasting system; NMME; DTVGM; Soil moisture; Han River basin,HYDROLOGICAL FORECASTING SYSTEM; SKILL,,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"ONE NEW YORK PLAZA, SUITE 4600, NEW YORK, NY, UNITED STATES",0930-7575,1432-0894,,CLIM DYNAM,Clim.

357,Multi-Model Approaches for Improving Seasonal Ensemble Streamflow Prediction Scheme with Various Statistical Post-Processing Techniques in the Canadian Prairie Region,"Hydrologic models are an approximation of reality, and thus, are not able to perfectly simulate observed streamflow because of various sources of uncertainty. On the other hand, skillful operational hydrologic forecasts are vital in water resources engineering and management for preparedness against flooding and extreme events. Multi-model techniques can be used to help represent and quantify various uncertainties in forecasting. In this paper, we assess the performance of a Multi-model Seasonal Ensemble Streamflow Prediction (MSESP) scheme coupled with statistical post-processing techniques to issue operational uncertainty for the Manitoba Hydrologic Forecasting Centre (HFC). The Ensemble Streamflow Predictions (ESPs) from WATFLOOD and SWAT hydrologic models were used along with four statistical post-processing techniques: Linear Regression (LR), Quantile Mapping (QM), Quantile Model Averaging (QMA), and Bayesian Model Averaging (BMA)]. The quality of MSESP was investigated from April to July with a lead time of three months for the Upper Assiniboine River Basin (UARB) at Kamsack, Canada. While multi-model ESPs coupled with post-processing techniques improve predictability (in general), results suggest that additional avenues for improving the skill and value of seasonal streamflow prediction. Next steps towards an operational ESP system include adding more operationally used models, improving models calibration methods to reduce model bias, increasing ESP sample size, and testing ESP schemes at multiple lead times, which, once developed, will not only help HFCs in Canada but would also help Centers South of the Border.",https://doi.org/10.3390/w10111604,10.3390/w10111604,"Muhammad, Ameer; Stadnyk, Tricia A.; Unduche, Fisaha; Coulibaly, Paulin",WATER,ensemble streamflow forecast; multi-model combination; post-processing; uncertainty estimation; WATFLOOD; SWAT,GEOGRAPHICALLY ISOLATED WETLANDS; CLIMATE-CHANGE; HYDROLOGICAL MODELS; UNCERTAINTY; FORECASTS; SIMULATIONS; SKILL; PRECIPITATION; COMBINATION; PERFORMANCE,,MDPI,BASEL,"ST ALBAN-ANLAGE 66, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND",,2073-4441,,WATER-SUI,Water,NOV,2018,10,11,,,1604,
358,Estimating the added value of GRACE total water storage and uncertainty quantification in seasonal streamflow forecasting,"Seasonal streamflow prediction is vital for water resources management and disaster mitigation. Multiple linear regression (MLR), as the simplest yet effective statistical model, is widely used in hydrological forecasting. To investigate the added value of incorporating GRACE total water storage anomalies (TWSA) in seasonal streamflow prediction and quantifying the uncertainty in model residuals, this study constructed four MLR models, namely a benchmark model, TWSA-incorporated model, uncertainty quantified model and synthetic model, to predict monthly streamflow in Yarlung Zangbo River, Upper Jinshajiang River, Xiangjiang River and Lanjiang River with lead times from 1 to 11 months. The results show that MLR models perform fairly well, with correlation coefficients greater than 0.8 and Nash-Sutcliffe efficiency coefficients up to 0.73. TWSA contributes moderately to forecast skill, whilst about 15% of the forecast skill is attributed to uncertainty quantification. The synergy of TWSA and uncertainty quantification brings basin-varying contributions, ranging from 5% to 26%.",https://doi.org/10.1080/02626667.2021.1998510,10.1080/02626667.2021.1998510,"Liu, Li; Xie, Jingkai; Gu, Haiting; Xu, Yue-Ping",HYDROLOGICAL SCIENCES JOURNAL-JOURNAL DES SCIENCES HYDROLOGIQUES,seasonal streamflow forecast; multiple linear regression; GRACE; uncertainty quantification; hydrological ensemble prediction,DATA-DRIVEN MODELS; RIVER-BASIN; PRECIPITATION FORECASTS; ENSEMBLE PREDICTION; PERFORMANCE; CALIBRATION; DROUGHT; OPTIMIZATION; RESOURCES; IMPROVE,,TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD,ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OR14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0262-6667,2150-3435,,HYDROLOG SCI J,Hydrol.

Therefore, accurate forecast and analysis of climatic change trends are the prerequisite to disaster alleviation and prevention. This paper selects a large-scale climate predictor by modeling steps and evaluation indicators for a statistical downscaling (SD) model and establishes a statistical relation between atmospheric circulation factor and precipitation and air temperature at eight stations in Wei River basin in Shaanxi Province for a global climate model output based on hydrological data for Wei River basin in Shaanxi Province.

360,Evaluation of the potential of using subsets of historical climatological data for ensemble streamflow prediction (ESP) forecasting,"Streamflow forecasting is a crucial task for hydropower operations, flood forecasting and water resource use optimization. Ensemble Streamflow Prediction (ESP) is commonly used in the case of long-term lead times (a few months or seasons ahead). ESP covers the use of historical meteorological scenarios in driving a hydrological model to generate an ensemble of possible future streamflow. Many studies have evaluated methods for selecting optimal subsets of scenarios to improve forecasting skill, and indeed, this is still an ongoing area of research. In this study, we propose a procedure that calculates the maximum potential skill of a classic ESP forecast. A genetic algorithm (GA) is used to determine the best possible set of climatological scenarios given any ensemble size. Along with providing a direct estimate of the ESP forecasting potential in hindcast experiments, the method can be used as a reference for comparing other methods to ESP. The procedure is also used to compare classical ESP, a well-established forecasting method, with two new methods, namely, the Analogue method and the Contingency Table (CT) approach. A discriminant analysis is finally implemented to attempt to identify key features of ESP members that performed well as compared to their counterparts using historic climatology and climate indices. It is shown while there exists a potential for improvement, a lot of research must still be realized to exploit this potential. The procedure was tested over two basins in Canada. In general, results showed that for any forecast date, decreasing the ensemble size led to a higher potential for better forecasting skills. However, the method does not yet allow identifying the subset of the entire climatology to be used to maximize the ESP forecast performance.",https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jhydrol.2020.125656,10.1016/j.jhydrol.2020.125656,"Sabzipour, Behmard; Arsenault, Richard; Brissette, Francois",JOURNAL OF HYDROLOGY,Ensemble Streamflow Prediction; Genetic Algorithm; Potential skill; CRPS,PRECIPITATION; MODEL; SKILL; ENSO,,ELSEVIER,AMSTERDAM,"RADARWEG 29, 1043 NX AMSTERDAM, NETHERLANDS",0022-1694,1879-2707,,J HYDROL,J.

361,"Validation and Projections of Climate Characteristics in the Saginaw Bay Watershed, MI, for Hydrologic Modeling Applications","Fundamental differences in the nature of climate and hydrologic models make coupling of future climate projections to models of watershed hydrology challenging. This study uses the NCAR Weather Research and Forecast model (WRF) to dynamically downscale climate simulations over the Saginaw Bay Watershed, MI and prepare the results for input into semi-distributed hydrologic models. One realization of the bias-corrected NCAR CESM1 model's RCP 8.5 climate scenario is dynamically downscaled at a spatial resolution of 3 km by 3 km for the end of the twenty-first century and validated based on a downscaled run for the end of the twentieth century in comparison to ASOS and NWS COOP stations. Bias-correction is conducted using Quantile Mapping to correct daily maximum and minimum temperature, precipitation, and relative humidity for use in future hydrologic model experiments. In the Saginaw Bay Watershed the end of the twenty-first century is projected to see maximum and minimum average daily temperatures warming by 5.7 and 6.3 degrees C respectively. Precipitation characteristics over the watershed show an increase in mean annual precipitation (average of +14.3 mm over the watershed), mainly due to increases in precipitation intensity (average of +0.3 mm per precipitation day) despite a decrease in frequency of -10.7 days per year. The projected changes have substantial implications for watershed processes including flood prediction, erosion, mobilization of non-point source and legacy contaminants, and evapotranspirative demand, among others.

362,Temporal prediction of algal parameters in Three Gorges Reservoir based on highly time-resolved monitoring and long short-term memory network,"Many dammed rivers throughout the world have experienced frequent harmful algal blooms (HABs) in the context of climate change and anthropogenic activities. Accurate forecasting of algal parameters (i.e., algal cell density and microcystin concentration) has great practical significance for taking precautions against HABs risks. Long short-term memory (LSTM) networks have recently shown potential in predicting water quality parameters. However, there is still little known about the robustness of the LSTM in forecasting highly time-resolved measurement of algal parameters. This study developed a hybrid deep-learning architecture (XG-LSTM) composed of one XGBoost module and two parallel LSTM models to predict algal cell density and microcystin concentration in the Three Gorges Reservoir (TGR). The proposed model was validated by in situ multi-sensor-system monitoring data at four bloom-impacted tributaries in the TGR. Each modelling process utilized the antecedent information of the algal parameters and the corresponding environmental variables as inputs for forecasting the algal parameters for the coming hours and days. As expected, the presented model achieved better performance than those without special feature extraction procedures, providing that the use of selected environmental parameters can improve LSTM performance. In addition, the hybrid XG-LSTM model successfully captured the time-series patterns of both algal cell density and microcystin concentration compared with other data-driven models, further suggesting the reliable utilization of this model in early warnings of bloom toxicity. Thus, the results presented demonstrate the potential of deep learning technology for real-time prediction of algal parameters in the TGR, and possibly for rapid detection of developing HABs in other aquatic ecosystems.",https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jhydrol.2021.127304,10.1016/j.jhydrol.2021.127304,"Shan, Kun; Ouyang, Tian; Wang, Xiaoxiao; Yang, Hong; Zhou, Botian; Wu, Zhongxing; Shang, Mingsheng",JOURNAL OF HYDROLOGY,Harmful algal bloom; Real-time monitoring; Long short-term memory network; Microcystin; Three Gorges Reservoir,WATER-QUALITY; MICROCYSTIN CONCENTRATIONS; CYANOBACTERIAL BLOOMS; MODELING APPROACH; NEURAL-NETWORK; FRESH-WATER; XIANGXI BAY; LAKE TAIHU; MANAGEMENT; DYNAMICS,,ELSEVIER,AMSTERDAM,"RADARWEG 29, 1043 NX AMSTERDAM, NETHERLANDS",0022-1694,1879-2707,,J HYDROL,J.

363,"Scientific forecast use and factors of influence in water-constrained contexts: The case of Guanacaste, Costa Rica","Unexpected changes in the amount and timing of seasonal precipitation and temperature provide significant challenges to stakeholders in water-constrained areas of the world. These changes are particularly problematic for decisions that face economic and organizational constraints from those changes. The use of climate forecasts informed by scientific observations and statistical analyses that assume system dynamism may improve decision making and outcomes, however many of these stakeholders rely on traditional and/or folkloric strategies based on observations from the environment. Here we survey 87 stakeholders representing groups such as national agencies, farmers, and water managers in the semi-arid region of Guanacaste, Costa Rica on (1) their perceptions of freshwater security, (2) the role of forecast type (weekly, seasonal, and yearly) plays in their decision making, and (3) the factors that most influence the use of forecasts in decision making. Stakeholders report having enough freshwater to meet their current needs, however they are less certain about the future. Stakeholders are generally using forecasts but that use is not uniform - the most vulnerable to shocks are those that tend to trust traditional and/or folkloric methods the most, and are the least likely to use longer-term forecasts in their decision making.

364,"Time-Evolving, Spatially Explicit Forecasts of the Northern Gulf of Mexico Hypoxic Zone","The Mississipp-Atchafalaya River Basin delivers large amounts of freshwater and nutrients to the northern Gulf of Mexico promoting the development of a large hypoxic zone every summer. Statistical and semiempirical models have long been used to provide seasonal forecasts of the mid-summer hypoxic extent using historic time series of spring nutrient load and mid-summer hypoxic extent. These forecasts consist of a scalar estimate of the hypoxic area with uncertainty but do not include spatial distributions or temporal evolution of hypoxic conditions. Three-dimensional (3D) circulation-biogeochemical models of the coastal ocean simulate the temporal evolution of hypoxia in a spatially explicit manner but have not yet been used for seasonal hypoxia forecasting. Here, we present a hybrid method for seasonal, spatially explicit, time-evolving forecasts of the hypoxic zone that combines statistical forecasting with information from a 3D biogeochemical model. The hybrid method uses spring nitrate load and a multiyear (1985-2018) 3D hindcast simulation to produce a seasonal forecast. Validation shows that the method explains up to 76% of the observed year-to-year variability in the hypoxic area. The forecasts suggest that the maximum seasonal extent of hypoxia is reached, on average, on August 13, 2 weeks after the completion of the annual cruise. An analysis of month-to-month variations in hypoxia forecasts due to variability in wind speed and freshwater discharge allows estimates of weather-related uncertainties in the forecast.",https://doi.org/10.1021/acs.est.9b05790,10.1021/acs.est.9b05790,"Laurent, Arnaud; Fennel, Katja",ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE & TECHNOLOGY,,PREDICTING SUMMER HYPOXIA; MISSISSIPPI RIVER; SKILL ASSESSMENT; WATER-QUALITY; MODEL; DYNAMICS; PHOSPHORUS; NITROGEN; AREA; CONSEQUENCES,,AMER CHEMICAL SOC,WASHINGTON,"1155 16TH ST, NW, WASHINGTON, DC 20036 USA",0013-936X,1520-5851,,ENVIRON SCI TECHNOL,Environ.

365,Explore an evolutionary recurrent ANFIS for modelling multi-step-ahead flood forecasts,"Reliable and precise multi-step-ahead flood forecasts are crucial and beneficial to decision makers for mitigating flooding risks. For a river basin undergoing fast urban development, its regional meteorological condition interacts frequently with intensive human activities and climate change, which gives rise to the non-stationary process between rainfall and runoff whose non-stationary features is difficult to be captured by a non-recurrent data-driven model with a static learning mechanism. This study proposes a recurrent Adaptive-Network-based Fuzzy Inference System (R-ANFIS) embedded with Genetic Algorithm and Least Square Estimator (GL) that optimize model parameters for making multi-step-ahead forecasts. The main merit of the proposed method (R-ANFIS(GL)) lies in capturing the features of the non-stationary process between rainfall and runoff series as well as in alleviating time-lag effects encountered in multi-step-ahead flood forecasting. To demonstrate model reliability and effectiveness, the R-ANFIS(GL) model was implemented to make multi-step-ahead forecasts from horizons t + 1 up to t + 8 for a famous benchmark chaotic time series and a flood inflow series of the Three Gorges Reservoir (TGR) in China. For comparison purpose, two ANFIS neural networks of different structures (one dynamic and one static neural networks) were also implemented. Numerical and experimental results indicated that the R-ANFIS(GL) model not only outperformed the two comparative networks but significantly enhanced the accuracy of multi-step-ahead forecasts for both chaotic time series and the reservoir inflow case during flood seasons, where effective mitigation of time-lag bottlenecks was achieved. We demonstrated that the R-ANFIS(GL) model could suitably configure the complex non-stationary rainfall-runoff process and effectively integrate the monitored rainfall and discharge data with the latest outputs of the model so that the time shift problem could be alleviated and model reliability as well as forecast accuracy for future horizons could be significantly improved.",https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jhydrol.2018.12.040,10.1016/j.jhydrol.2018.12.040,"Zhou, Yanlai; Guo, Shenglian; Chang, Fi-John",JOURNAL OF HYDROLOGY,Artificial Intelligence (AI); Recurrent ANFIS; Evolutionary algorithm; Multi-step-ahead flood forecast; Time series; Three Gorges Reservoir (TGR),FUZZY INFERENCE SYSTEM; SUPPORT VECTOR MACHINE; ARTIFICIAL NEURAL-NETWORK; GENETIC ALGORITHM; CLIMATE-CHANGE; WATER-LEVEL; RAINFALL; INTELLIGENCE; PREDICTION; ENSEMBLE,,ELSEVIER SCIENCE BV,AMSTERDAM,"PO BOX 211, 1000 AE AMSTERDAM, NETHERLANDS",0022-1694,1879-2707,,J HYDROL,J.

366,A classification-based deep belief networks model framework for daily streamflow forecasting,"Data-driven models can achieve high accuracy and low computational cost without a priori knowledge of hydrological system, which have been successfully applied in streamflow forecasting for decades. However, it is still a challenging task to improve the performance of these models, especially for the rivers with dramatic flow changes. In this paper, a new integrated framework for daily streamflow forecasting based on different flow regimes is developed. The framework integrates a Fuzzy C-means (FCM) clustering for streamflow regime identification, a partial mutual information (PMI) for input selection, Deep Belief Networks (DBN) for mapping the nonlinear relationships between the selected inputs and streamflow during different streamflow dynamics processes, and a rigorous validation process considering structure validity to interpret the physical processes simulated using the DBN models. The framework was applied to three streamflow stations with different climate conditions in USA, and the results show that the framework has significantly improved modelling performance (approximately 12%) compared to single data-driven models. The integration of data-driven models and physical process classification also leads to improved integration of physical understanding of the complex characteristic of different flow regimes into the modelling process, leading to overall improved confidence in the developed daily streamflow forecasting models.",https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jhydrol.2021.125967,10.1016/j.jhydrol.2021.125967,"Chu, Haibo; Wei, Jiahua; Wu, Wenyan; Jiang, Yuan; Chu, Qi; Meng, Xiujing",JOURNAL OF HYDROLOGY,Daily streamflow forecasting; Deep belief network; Rigorous model validation; Streamflow process classification,ARTIFICIAL NEURAL-NETWORK; FUZZY C-MEANS; DATA-DRIVEN MODELS; VARIABLE SELECTION; INFORMATION; PERFORMANCE; VALIDATION,,ELSEVIER,AMSTERDAM,"RADARWEG 29, 1043 NX AMSTERDAM, NETHERLANDS",0022-1694,1879-2707,,J HYDROL,J.

As part of the Climate Science for Services Partnership in China, Chinese and UK scientists, along with key decision makers in this region, are working closely together to understand the needs for climate information, co-develop a seasonal rainfall forecast service aiming to help meet these needs, and evaluate the value or usefulness of this service in supporting decision making to manage risk in the lower Yangtze Basin. We find that there is a range of users reliant on such a service, and that the current service contributes strongly to decision-making for many users. Through close co-operation between providers and users of the service, we also gain a good understanding of the limitations of the current service and outline developments needed to enhance its utility.",https://doi.org/10.1016/j.crm.2019.01.002,10.1016/j.crm.2019.01.002,"Golding, Nicola; Hewitt, Chris; Zhang, Peiqun; Liu, Min; Zhang, Jun; Bett, Philip",CLIMATE RISK MANAGEMENT,Seasonal forecast; Climate service; User engagement; Co-development; Yangtze River,CLIMATE INFORMATION; SYSTEMS; EAST,,ELSEVIER,AMSTERDAM,"RADARWEG 29, 1043 NX AMSTERDAM, NETHERLANDS",2212-0963,,,CLIM RISK MANAG,CLIM.

368,Predicting stream water quality under different urban development pattern scenarios with an interpretable machine learning approach,"Urban development pattern significantly impacts stream water quality by influencing pollutant generation, build-up, and wash-off processes. It is thus necessary to understand and predict stream water quality in accordance with different urban development patterns to effectively advise urban growth planning and policies. To do so, we collected pollutant concentration data on nitrate (NO3--N), total phosphate (TP), and Escherichia coli (E. coli) from 1047 sampling stations in the Texas Gulf Region. We utilized a Random Forest (RF) machine learning model to predict stream water quality under four planning scenarios with different urban densities and configurations. SHapley Additive exPlanations (SHAP) was used to prove the importance of urban development pattern in influencing stream water quality. The spatial variations of the impact of these patterns were explored with Geographically Weighted Regression (GWR). SHAP results indicated that Largest Patch Index (LPI), Patch Cohesion Index (COHESION), Splitting Index (SPLIT), and Landscape Division Index (DIVISION) were the most important urban development pattern metrics affecting stream water quality. The spatial variations of such patterns were shown to impact stream water quality depending on pollutants, seasonality, climate, and urbanization level. RF prediction results suggested that high density aggregated development was more effective in reducing TP and NO3--N concentrations than the current sprawl development, but had the potential risk of increasing E. coli pollution in the wet season. The results of this study provide empirical evidence and a potential mechanistic explanation that stream water quality degradation is a consequence of urban sprawl. Lastly, machine learning is a powerful tool for scenario prediction in land use planning to forecast environmental impacts under different urban development pattern scenarios. (C) 2020 Elsevier B.V.

369,Evaluating and Predicting the Effects of Land Use Changes on Water Quality Using SWAT and CA-Markov Models,"Dongliao River Basin (DLRB) is facing serious deterioration of water quality impacted by anthropogenic activities. As China attaches increasing importance to environmental protection, many regions are trying to reduce water pollution through land use changes. The long-term variations of the nonpoint source (NPS) pollution affected by land use changes in the DLRB have not been previously assessed. In this study, the contributions of land use/land cover (LULC) changes in 1980-2015 to NPS pollution were evaluated by comparing simulations under paired land use scenarios using the Soil and Water Assessment Tool (SWAT). The historical trend and ecological protection scenarios in 2025 were established based on CA-Markov model, and pollution loads in both scenarios were forecasted. Results show that the expansion of dryland and urban areas and the decline in forest and grassland coverage were the major contributors to the increase in NPS pollution in the DLRB. The expansion of paddy field resulted in an increase in actual total phosphorus (TP) but a decrease in total nitrogen (TN). In the historical trend scenario, dryland would decrease by 4.57%. TN and TP loads were 1.40% and 1.45% lower than those in 2015, respectively. In the ecological protection scenario, TN and TP loads were 3.37% and 6.11% lower than those in 2015, respectively, due to the decreased area of dryland by 7.22%. Pollutions in the riverside and southeast areas of the basin would be reduced in 2025. This finding shows that NPS pollution is controlled under the current policy.",https://doi.org/10.1007/s11269-019-02427-0,10.1007/s11269-019-02427-0,"Gong, Xiaoyan; Bian, Jianmin; Wang, Yu; Jia, Zhuo; Wan, Hanli",WATER RESOURCES MANAGEMENT,Land use; land cover; CA-Markov; NPS pollution; Modeling; SWAT,NONPOINT-SOURCE POLLUTION; NITROGEN POLLUTION; ASSESSMENT-TOOL; CLIMATE-CHANGE; SOURCE AREA; RIVER; BASIN; URBANIZATION; OPTIMIZATION; SOIL,,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0920-4741,1573-1650,,WATER RESOUR MANAG,Water Resour.

370,A Time Series Model Comparison for Monitoring and Forecasting Water Quality Variables,"The monitoring and prediction of water quality parameters are important tasks in the management of water resources. In this work, the performances of time series statistical models were evaluated to predict and forecast the dissolved oxygen (DO) concentration in several monitoring sites located along the main river Vouga, in Portugal, during the period from January 2002 to May 2015. The models being compared are a regression model with correlated errors and a state-space model, which can be seen as a calibration model. Both models allow the incorporation of water quality variables, such as time correlation or seasonality. Results show that, for the DO variable, the calibration model outperforms the regression model for sample modeling, that is, for a short-term forecast, while the regression model with correlated errors has a better performance for the forecasting h-steps ahead framework. So, the calibration model is more useful for water monitoring using an online or real-time procedure, while the regression model with correlated errors can be applied in order to forecast over a longer period of time.",https://doi.org/10.3390/hydrology5030037,10.3390/hydrology5030037,"Monteiro, Magda; Costa, Marco",HYDROLOGY,monthly data; time series analysis; state-space modeling; regression modeling; autoregressive errors; dissolved oxygen concentration,DISSOLVED-OXYGEN; RIVER; PARAMETERS; SITES,,MDPI,BASEL,"ST ALBAN-ANLAGE 66, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND",2306-5338,,,HYDROLOGY-BASEL,Hydrology,SEP,2018,5,3,,,37,
371,"Evaluation of the applicability of climate forecast system reanalysis weather data for hydrologic simulation: A case study in the Bahe River Basin of the Qinling Mountains, China","In recent years, global reanalysis weather data has been widely used in hydrological modeling around the world, but the results of simulations vary greatly. To consider the applicability of Climate Forecast System Reanalysis (CFSR) data in the hydrologic simulation of watersheds, the Bahe River Basin was used as a case study. Two types of weather data (conventional weather data and CFSR weather data) were considered to establish a Soil and Water Assessment Tool (SWAT) model, which was used to simulate runoff from 2001 to 2012 in the basin at annual and monthly scales. The effect of both datasets on the simulation was assessed using regression analysis, Nash-Sutcliffe Efficiency (NSE), and Percent Bias (PBIAS). A CFSR weather data correction method was proposed. The main results were as follows. (1) The CFSR climate data was applicable for hydrologic simulation in the Bahe River Basin (R-2 of the simulated results above 0.50, NSE above 0.33, and |PBIAS| below 14.8. Although the quality of the CFSR weather data is not perfect, it achieved a satisfactory hydrological simulation after rainfall data correction. (2) The simulated streamflow using the CFSR data was higher than the observed streamflow, which was likely because the estimation of daily rainfall data by CFSR weather data resulted in more rainy days and stronger rainfall intensity than was actually observed. Therefore, the data simulated a higher base flow and flood peak discharge in terms of the water balance, except for some individual years. (3) The relation between the CFSR rainfall data (x) and the observed rainfall data (y) could be represented by a power exponent equation: y=1.4789x(0.8875) (R-2= 0.98, P < 0.001). There was a slight variation between the fitted equations for each station. The equation provides a theoretical basis for the correction of CFSR rainfall data.",https://doi.org/10.1007/s11442-017-1392-6,10.1007/s11442-017-1392-6,Hu Sheng; Qiu Haijun; Yang Dongdong; Cao Mingming; Song Jinxi; Wu Jiang; Huang Chenlu; Gao Yu,JOURNAL OF GEOGRAPHICAL SCIENCES,CFSR; weather data; hydrologic simulation; applicability evaluation; SWAT model; Bahe River Basin,WATER-RESOURCES; MODEL; CFSR; CALIBRATION; ACCURACY,,SCIENCE PRESS,BEIJING,"16 DONGHUANGCHENGGEN NORTH ST, BEIJING 100717, PEOPLES R CHINA",1009-637X,1861-9568,,J GEOGR SCI,J.

372,Assessment and Prediction of Groundwater using Geospatial and ANN Modeling,"In semi-arid regions, the deterioration in groundwater quality and drop in water level upshots the importance of water resource management for drinking and irrigation. Therefore geospatial techniques could be integrated with mathematical models for accurate spatiotemporal mapping of groundwater risk areas at the village level. In the present study, changes in water level, quality patterns, and future trends were analyzed using eight years (2012-2019) groundwater data for 171 villages of the Phagi tehsil, Jaipur district. Kriging interpolation method was used to draw spatial maps for the pre-monsoon season. These datasets were integrated with three different time series forecasting models (Simple Exponential Smoothing, Holt's Trend Method, ARIMA) and Artificial Neural Network models for accurate prediction of groundwater level and quality parameters. Results reveal that the ANN model can describe groundwater level and quality parameters more accurately than the time series forecasting models. The change in groundwater level was observed with more than 4.0 m rise in 81 villages during 2012-2013, whereas ANN predicted results of 2023-2024 predict no rise in water level > 4.0 m. However, based on predicted results of 2024, the water level will drop by more than 6.0 m in 16 villages of Phagi. Assessment of water quality index reveals unfit groundwater in 74% villages for human consumption in 2024. This time series and projected groundwater level and quality at the micro-level can assist decision-makers in sustainable groundwater management.",https://doi.org/10.1007/s11269-021-02874-8,10.1007/s11269-021-02874-8,"Dadhich, Ankita P.; Goyal, Rohit; Dadhich, Pran N.",WATER RESOURCES MANAGEMENT,Groundwater; Water quality; Geospatial; ARIMA; Artificial neural network,SEMIARID REGION; QUALITY; GIS; REGRESSION; DRINKING; INDEX,,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0920-4741,1573-1650,,WATER RESOUR MANAG,Water Resour.

We develop an approach to predict the spatially- and temporally-resolved probability of exceeding a public health advisory (PHA) level (6 mu g/L) of microcystins in the western basin of Lake Erie that would be suitable for use in a forecast system, consisting of 1) an existing HAB chlorophyll forecast system, 2) a toxin-chlorophyll-a relationship that is updated weekly from observations, and 3) a statistical model relating observed relative frequency of exceeding the PHA to model predictions over a hindcast period. We evaluate the system's performance and the system's useful level of skill.

375,Forecasting Groundwater Table in a Flood Prone Coastal City with Long Short-term Memory and Recurrent Neural Networks,"Many coastal cities are facing frequent flooding from storm events that are made worse by sea level rise and climate change. The groundwater table level in these low relief coastal cities is an important, but often overlooked, factor in the recurrent flooding these locations face. Infiltration of stormwater and water intrusion due to tidal forcing can cause already shallow groundwater tables to quickly rise toward the land surface. This decreases available storage which increases runoff, stormwater system loads, and flooding. Groundwater table forecasts, which could help inform the modeling and management of coastal flooding, are generally unavailable. This study explores two machine learning models, Long Short-term Memory (LSTM) networks and Recurrent Neural Networks (RNN), to model and forecast groundwater table response to storm events in the flood prone coastal city of Norfolk, Virginia. To determine the effect of training data type on model accuracy, two types of datasets (i) the continuous time series and (ii) a dataset of only storm events, created from observed groundwater table, rainfall, and sea level data from 2010-2018 are used to train and test the models. Additionally, a real-time groundwater table forecasting scenario was carried out to compare the models' abilities to predict groundwater table levels given forecast rainfall and sea level as input data. When modeling the groundwater table with observed data, LSTM networks were found to have more predictive skill than RNNs (root mean squared error (RMSE) of 0.09 m versus 0.14 m, respectively). The real-time forecast scenario showed that models trained only on storm event data outperformed models trained on the continuous time series data (RMSE of 0.07 m versus 0.66 m, respectively) and that LSTM outperformed RNN models. Because models trained with the continuous time series data had much higher RMSE values, they were not suitable for predicting the groundwater table in the real-time scenario when using forecast input data. These results demonstrate the first use of LSTM networks to create hourly forecasts of groundwater table in a coastal city and show they are well suited for creating operational forecasts in real-time. As groundwater table levels increase due to sea level rise, forecasts of groundwater table will become an increasingly valuable part of coastal flood modeling and management.",https://doi.org/10.3390/w11051098,10.3390/w11051098,"Bowes, Benjamin D.; Sadler, Jeffrey M.; Morsy, Mohamed M.; Behl, Madhur; Goodall, Jonathan L.",WATER,groundwater table; forecast; recurrent neural network; long short-term memory; coastal flooding,SEA-LEVEL RISE; ARTIFICIAL-INTELLIGENCE; MODEL; INUNDATION; VARIABLES; PREDICTION; SYSTEMS; SITES; DEPTH; BASIN,,MDPI,BASEL,"ST ALBAN-ANLAGE 66, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND",,2073-4441,,WATER-SUI,Water,MAY,2019,11,5,,,1098,
376,Predictability of the mid-summer surface air temperature over the Yangtze River valley in the National Centers for Environmental Prediction Climate Forecast System,"By using the hindcast and forecast data from the National Centers for Environmental Prediction Climate Forecast System version 2 (NCEP CFSv2) for the 1982-2018 period, we investigate the forecasting skills of the mid-summer (July and August) surface air temperature (SAT) at interannual timescales in this study. Although CFSv2 predictions show a warm bias for the climatological mean SAT over the Yangtze River valley (25 degrees-32 degrees N, 105 degrees-122 degrees E), they show a consistent and great performance in predicting the interannual variability of the mid-summer SAT over this region until 4 months in advance, where the linear correlation coefficient between the predicted and observed time series reaches +0.65, +0.51 and + 0.68 for 4, 2 and 0 months in advance, respectively. The CFSv2 predictions well simulate the linkage between the SAT anomalies over the Yangtze River valley and the anomalous atmospheric circulation aloft, including the circumglobal teleconnection and zonal extension of the Western Pacific Subtropical High. However, CFSv2 has trouble in simulating the associated vertical velocity, cloud cover and solar radiation anomalies, except for 0 months in advance. The persistent forecasting skills result from the accurate response of the circumglobal teleconnection and Western Pacific Subtropical High to the El Nino/Southern Oscillation and sea surface temperature (SST) anomalies over the mid-latitude North Atlantic. Correspondingly, the forecasting skill, signal and signal-to-noise ratio are effectively improved in the years with strong mid-summer SST anomalies over the tropical central-eastern Pacific or mid-latitude North Atlantic. These results are useful for understanding the predictability of the mid-summer SAT over the Yangtze River valley.",https://doi.org/10.1002/joc.6670,10.1002/joc.6670,"Tang, Shankai; Qiao, Shaobo; Feng, Taichen; Jia, Zikang; Zang, Naihui; Feng, Guolin",INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF CLIMATOLOGY,El Nino; southern oscillation; mid-summer surface air temperature; predictability; Western Pacific subtropical high; Yangtze River valley,HEAT-WAVE; ENSO PREDICTABILITY; SEA INTERACTION; NORTH-ATLANTIC; COUPLED MODEL; EL-NINO; SUMMER; VARIABILITY; PACIFIC; CHINA,,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0899-8418,1097-0088,,INT J CLIMATOL,Int.

377,Evaluation of Snowmelt Estimation Techniques for Enhanced Spring Peak Flow Prediction,"Water resources management and planning requires accurate and reliable spring flood forecasts. In cold and snowy countries, particularly in snow-dominated watersheds, enhanced flood prediction requires adequate snowmelt estimation techniques. Whereas the majority of the studies on snow modeling have focused on comparing the performance of empirical techniques and physically based methods, very few studies have investigated empirical models and conceptual models for improving spring peak flow prediction. The objective of this study is to investigate the potential of empirical degree-day method (DDM) to effectively and accurately predict peak flows compared to sophisticated and conceptual SNOW-17 model at two watersheds in Canada: the La-Grande River Basin (LGRB) and the Upper Assiniboine river at Shellmouth Reservoir (UASR). Additional insightful contributions include the evaluation of a seasonal model calibration approach, an annual model calibration method, and two hydrological models: McMaster University Hydrologiska Byrans Vattenbalansavdelning (MAC-HBV) and Sacramento Soil Moisture Accounting model (SAC-SMA). A total of eight model scenarios were considered for each watershed. Results indicate that DDM was very competitive with SNOW-17 at both the study sites, whereas it showed significant improvement in prediction accuracy at UASR. Moreover, the seasonally calibrated model appears to be an effective alternative to an annual model calibration approach, while the SAC-SMA model outperformed the MAC-HBV model, no matter which snowmelt computation method, calibration approach, or study basin is used. Conclusively, the DDM and seasonal model calibration approach coupled with the SAC-SMA hydrologic model appears to be a robust model combination for spring peak flow estimation.",https://doi.org/10.3390/w12051290,10.3390/w12051290,"Agnihotri, Jetal; Coulibaly, Paulin",WATER,hydrological models; spring peak flow prediction; snowmelt estimation; calibration approaches; reservoir inflow,LATITUDE HYDROLOGICAL PROCESSES; TORNE-KALIX BASIN; TEMPERATURE-INDEX; PILPS PHASE-2(E); ENERGY BUDGET; STREAMFLOW; MODEL; PERFORMANCE; SIMULATIONS; UNCERTAINTY,,MDPI,BASEL,"ST ALBAN-ANLAGE 66, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND",,2073-4441,,WATER-SUI,Water,MAY,2020,12,5,,,1290,

The goal of this research is to develop a hybrid model for forecasting short-term runoff time series, where the variational mode decomposition (VMD) is first used to decompose the original nonlinear natural streamflow into numerous subcomponents with different frequencies and resolutions. Second, the extreme learning machine (ELM) is used to excavate the complicated input-output relationship hidden in each subcomponent, and the emerging sine cosine algorithm (SCA) is used to determine the suitable network parameter for each ELM model. Finally, the forecasting results of all the modelled subcomponents are summarized to form the forecasting result for original streamflow. Based on several statistical evaluation measures, the feasibility of the hybrid method is investigated in runoff forecasting for Danjiangkou Reservoir in China. The results indicate that the hybrid method can produce superior forecasting results compared to several control methods, providing accurate streamflow prediction information for operators.",https://doi.org/10.1080/02626667.2020.1828889,10.1080/02626667.2020.1828889,"Niu, Wen-Jing; Feng, Zhong-Kai; Yang, Wen-Fa; Zhang, Jun",HYDROLOGICAL SCIENCES JOURNAL-JOURNAL DES SCIENCES HYDROLOGIQUES,nonstationary hydrological forecasting; variational mode decomposition; extreme learning machine; sine cosine algorithm,SINE COSINE ALGORITHM; MEMRISTIVE NEURAL-NETWORKS; OPTIMAL OPERATION; INFLOW FORECASTS; PARTICLE SWARM; OPTIMIZATION; SYNCHRONIZATION; DECOMPOSITION; REGRESSION; EVOLUTION,,TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD,ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OR14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0262-6667,2150-3435,,HYDROLOG SCI J,Hydrol.

379,"Historical Trends, Drivers, and Future Projections of Ice Phenology in Small North Temperate Lakes in the Laurentian Great Lakes Region","Lake ice phenology (timing of ice breakup and freeze up) is a sensitive indicator of climate. We acquired time series of lake ice breakup and freeze up, local weather conditions, and large-scale climate oscillations from 1981-2015 for seven lakes in northern Wisconsin, USA, and two lakes in Ontario, Canada. Multiple linear regression models were developed to understand the drivers of lake ice phenology. We used projected air temperature and precipitation from 126 climate change scenarios to forecast the day of year of ice breakup and freeze up in 2050 and 2070. Lake ice melted 5 days earlier and froze 8 days later over the past 35 years. Warmer spring and winter air temperatures contributed to earlier ice breakup; whereas warmer November temperatures delayed lake freeze. Lake ice breakup is projected to be 13 days earlier on average by 2070, but could vary by 3 days later to 43 days earlier depending upon the degree of climatic warming by late century. Similarly, the timing of lake freeze up is projected to be delayed by 11 days on average by 2070, but could be 1 to 28 days later.

380,Disturbance reverses classic biodiversity predictions in river-like landscapes,"Global analyses of biodiversity consistently reveal recurrent patterns of species distributions worldwide. However, unveiling the specific mechanisms behind those patterns remains logistically challenging, yet necessary for reliable biodiversity forecasts. Here, we combine theory and experiments to investigate the processes underlying spatial biodiversity patterns in dendritic, river-like landscapes, iconic examples of highly threatened ecosystems. We used geometric scaling properties, common to all rivers, to show that the distribution of biodiversity in these landscapes fundamentally depends on how ecological selection is modulated across space: while uniform ecological selection across the network leads to higher diversity in downstream confluences, this pattern can be inverted by disturbances when population turnover (i.e. local mortality) is higher upstream than downstream. Higher turnover in small headwater patches can slow down ecological selection, increasing local diversity in comparison to large downstream confluences. Our results show that disturbance-mediated slowing down of competitive exclusion can generate a specific transient signature in terms of biodiversity distribution when applied over a spatial gradient of disturbance, which is a common feature of many river landscapes.",https://doi.org/10.1098/rspb.2018.2441,10.1098/rspb.2018.2441,"Harvey, Eric; Gounand, Isabelle; Fronhofer, Emanuel A.; Altermatt, Florian",PROCEEDINGS OF THE ROYAL SOCIETY B-BIOLOGICAL SCIENCES,metacommunity; dendritic networks; biodiversity; patch size; perturbations,DENDRITIC CONNECTIVITY; DIVERSITY; DISPERSAL; PATTERNS; COEXISTENCE; NETWORKS; DYNAMICS; MODEL; COMPETITION; MECHANISMS,,ROYAL SOC,LONDON,"6-9 CARLTON HOUSE TERRACE, LONDON SW1Y 5AG, ENGLAND",0962-8452,1471-2954,,P ROY SOC B-BIOL SCI,Proc.

We apply the above methods to the Three Gorges Reservoir in the Yangtze River Basin, and the results show the following: (1) RF and XGB present better and more stable forecast performance than ENR and SVR. It can be concluded that the machine learning-based models have the potential for monthly streamflow forecasting. (2) The MSES can effectively reconstruct the original training data in the first layer and optimize the XGB model in the second layer, improving the forecast performance. We believe that the MSES is a computing framework worthy of development, with simple mathematical structure and low computational cost. (3) The forecast performance mainly depends on the size and distribution characteristics of the monthly streamflow sequence, which is still difficult to predict using only climate indices.",https://doi.org/10.2166/hydro.2019.066,10.2166/hydro.2019.066,"Li, Yujie; Liang, Zhongmin; Hu, Yiming; Li, Binquan; Xu, Bin; Wang, Dong",JOURNAL OF HYDROINFORMATICS,elastic net regression; eXtreme Gradient Boosting; monthly streamflow forecasting; random forest; stacking ensemble strategy; support vector regression,HYBRID APPROACH; HIDDEN MARKOV; RUNOFF MODEL; HYDROLOGY; REGION,,IWA PUBLISHING,LONDON,"ALLIANCE HOUSE, 12 CAXTON ST, LONDON SW1H0QS, ENGLAND",1464-7141,1465-1734,,J HYDROINFORM,J.

383,Long-term streamflow forecasting using SWAT through the integration of the random forests precipitation generator: case study of Danjiangkou Reservoir,"Long-term streamflow forecasting is of great significance to the optimal management of water resources. However, the forecast lead time of long-term streamflow forecasting is relatively long and the forecasted precipitation within the forecast lead time has inherent uncertainty, so long-term streamflow forecasting has major challenges. In this paper, a hybrid forecasting model is developed to improve accuracy of long-term streamflow forecasting by combining random forests (RF) and the Soil and Water Assessment Tool (SWAT). The RF model is used to forecast monthly precipitation which is further downscaled to a daily dataset according to the hydrological similarity principle for use in the SWAT model of the Danjiangkou Reservoir basin, China. Performance of this hybrid model is compared to that of seasonal autoregressive (SAR (P)) model. Results show the RF precipitation generator yields accurate predictions at the monthly scale and the hybrid model produces acceptable streamflow series in long-term forecasting cases. In addition, the comparison shows that in the Danjiangkou Reservoir basin, the hybrid model performs better than the SAR (P) model, with average Nash-Sutcliffe efficiency (NSE) values of 0.94 and 0.51, which is better when it is closer to 1. This study provides a method of improving accuracy of long-term streamflow forecasting.",https://doi.org/10.2166/nh.2017.085,10.2166/nh.2017.085,"Liang, Zhongmin; Tang, Tiantian; Li, Binquan; Liu, Tian; Wang, Jun; Hu, Yiming",HYDROLOGY RESEARCH,Danjiangkou Reservoir basin; hydrological similarity principle; long-term streamflow forecasting; random forests; SAR (P) model; SWAT,MODEL; ENSEMBLE; ACCURACY; RUNOFF; FLOW,,IWA PUBLISHING,LONDON,"ALLIANCE HOUSE, 12 CAXTON ST, LONDON SW1H0QS, ENGLAND",0029-1277,2224-7955,,HYDROL RES,Hydrol.

384,Towards an Operational Flow Forecasting System for the Upper Niagara River,"The authors developed a Hydrologic Engineering Center-River Analysis System (HEC-RAS) model to serve as the key component of a new, first-of-its-kind, short-term operational flow forecasting system for the Niagara River. The Niagara River transports a continental-scale flow (with an annual mean of roughly6,300 m3/s) that supports the economy of both the United States and Canada through hydropower generation, tourism, and other activities. The river also serves as a link connecting the two most downstream lakes (Lakes Erie and Ontario) in the largest system of lakes on Earth. Despite its significance, the authors know of no federally operated, short-term forecasting system for the Niagara River. Hydropower facilities management and other water resources management activities on the river have historically relied on an array of experimental, in-house, or proprietary models to simulate and forecast Niagara River flows. The study presented here fills this gap in large-scale hydraulic modeling and engineering science by calibrating a HEC-RAS model for the Upper Niagara River and customizing it to meet the operational requirements of the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) National Weather Service (NWS) Northeast River Forecasting Center (NERFC). The skill of the new forecasting system, which was recently deployed in its operational environment at the NERFC, will depend in large part on the accuracy of meteorological boundary conditions. The authors envision a more comprehensive assessment of the system's forecasting skill and other potential future model improvements as an area for future research.

385,Evaluation of artificial intelligence models for flood and drought forecasting in arid and tropical regions,"With the advancement of computer science, Artificial Intelligence (AI) is being incorporated into many fields to increase prediction performance. Disaster management is one of the main fields embracing the techniques of AI. It is essential to forecast the occurrence of disasters in advance to take the necessary mitigation steps and reduce damage to life and property. Therefore, many types of research are conducted to predict such events due to climate change in advance using hydrological, mathematical, and AI-based approaches. This paper presents a comparison of three major accepted AI-based approaches in flood and drought forecasting. In this study, fluvial floods are measured by the runoff change in rivers whereas meteorological droughts are measured using the Standard Precipitation Index (SPI). The performance of the Convolutional Neural Network (CNN), Long-Short Term Memory network (LSTM), and Wavelet decomposition functions combined with the Adaptive NeuroFuzzy Inference System (WANFIS) are compared in flood and drought forecasting, with five statistical performance criteria and accepted flood and drought indicators used for comparison, extending to two climatic regions: arid and tropical. The results suggest that the CNN performs best in flood forecasting with WANFIS for meteorological drought forecasting, regardless of the climate of the region under study. Besides, the results demonstrate the increased accuracy of the CNN in applications with multiple features in the input.",https://doi.org/10.1016/j.envsoft.2021.105136,10.1016/j.envsoft.2021.105136,"Adikari, Kasuni E.; Shrestha, Sangam; Ratnayake, Dhanika T.; Budhathoki, Aakanchya; Mohanasundaram, S.; Dailey, Matthew N.",ENVIRONMENTAL MODELLING & SOFTWARE,Forecasting; Floods; Droughts; Artificial intelligence; Convolutional neural network; Long-short term memory network,INDEX; PROVINCE,,ELSEVIER SCI LTD,OXFORD,"THE BOULEVARD, LANGFORD LANE, KIDLINGTON, OXFORD OX5 1GB, OXON, ENGLAND",1364-8152,1873-6726,,ENVIRON MODELL SOFTW,Environ.

386,Stochastic Forecasting Models of the Monthly Streamflow for the Blue Nile at Eldiem Station,"Egypt is almost totally dependent on the River Nile for satisfying about 95% of its water requirements. The River Nile has three main tributaries: White Nile, Blue Nile, and River Atbara. The Blue Nile contributes about 60% of total annual flow reached the River Nile at Aswan High Dam. The goal of this research is to develop a reliable stochastic model for the monthly streamflow of the Blue Nile at Eldiem station, where the Grand Ethiopian Renaissance Dam (GERD) is currently under construction with a storage capacity of about 74 billion m(3). The developed model may help to carry out a reliable study on the filling scenarios of GERD reservoir and to minimize its expected negative side effects on Sudan and Egypt. The linear models: Deseasonalized AutoRegressive Moving Average (DARMA) model, Periodic AutoRegressive Moving Average (PARMA) model and Seasonal AutoRegressive Integrated Moving Average (SARIMA) model; and the nonlinear Artificial Neural Network (ANN) model are selected for modeling monthly streamflow at Eldiem station. The performance of various models during calibration and validation were evaluated using the statistical indices: Mean Absolute Error, Root Mean Square Error and coefficient of determination (R-2) which indicate the strength of fitting between observed and forecasted values. The results show that the performance of the nonlinear model (ANN) was much better than all investigated linear models (DARMA, PARMA and SARIMA) in forecasting the monthly flow discharges at Eldiem station.",https://doi.org/10.1134/S0097807818030041,10.1134/S0097807818030041,"Elganainy, Mohamed A.; Eldwer, Alaa E.",WATER RESOURCES,Nile River; Blue Nile; Eldiem station; GERD; DARMA model; PARMA model; SARIMA; ANN,ARTIFICIAL NEURAL-NETWORKS; TIME-SERIES; RIVER; PREDICTION; FLOWS,,MAIK NAUKA/INTERPERIODICA/SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"233 SPRING ST, NEW YORK, NY 10013-1578 USA",0097-8078,1608-344X,,WATER RESOUR+,Water Resour.,MAY,2018,45,3,326,337,,

This research aims in evaluating the effectiveness of CHIRPS satellite rainfall data in comparison with IMD gridded Rainfall Data and development of various flow forecasting models. Daily rainfall data for three decades (1983-2012) over the Nethravathi Basin, Karnataka, India is used for analysis. The analysis is carried out for the monsoon season (June-September), out of which 70% data considered for training the model and remaining for testing. Different input combinations are developed, and soft-computing methods like ANFIS, GRNN, PSO-ANN, and ELM are applied for flow forecasting on a temporal scale. The model performance is evaluated using various statistical indices like NNSE, RRMSE, and MAE. The results indicate that CHIRPS rainfall showed better performance in comparison with IMD data.

The coupled model implemented in IMD is the Climate Forecast System version 2 (CFSv2).

The performance of extended range forecasts for the southwest monsoon seasons clearly captured the intra-seasonal variability of monsoon including delay/early onset of monsoon, active/break spells of monsoon and also withdrawal of monsoon in the real time in providing guidance for various applications. The MME based ERF also provides encouraging results to provide useful guidance upto 2/3 weeks about northeast monsoon and cyclogenesis potential during October to December (OND) over the north Indian Ocean, heat wave, cold wave during summer and winter with statistically significant correlation coefficient (CC) upto two weeks. For applications in agriculture sector meteorological subdivision level forecasts are prepared for two weeks for the purpose of agro advisory.

389,"Forecasting near-future impacts of land use and climate change on the Zilbier river hydrological regime, northwestern Iran","We study and forecast the effects of near-future (NF) land use and climate changes (LUCC) on the hydrological regime (HR) within the Zilbier river basin located in arid and semiarid regions, in the Azerbaijan province in northeast and northwest of Iran in the recent past (2004-2014) and 2030. We used the baseline data (S-B) and 13 potential NF scenarios to evaluate the effects of changes in land use, temperature and precipitation, both in isolation and in combined scenarios by application of the Soil and Water Assessment Tool (SWAT). Climate changes (CC) were represented by the delta change approach based on trends for past 3 (1985-2014) or last decade (2005-2014), respectively (low delta change (LDC) and high delta change (HDC)), where the trends of the most recent decade yield a higher delta change when extrapolating to 2030. Similarly, land use changes were derived from trends observed based from satellite imagery and Cellular Automata-Markov model (CAM). In the NF, the results indicated that the climate would universally become warmer and drier under both LDC and HDC and increase the high-consumption land uses such as orchards in the study area, respectively. In 2030, CC tend to effect more conspicuously the HR than LU changes, leading to decrease in the entire hydrological component except evapotranspiration. Surveying the whole array of the simulated scenarios, there were clear and non-linear synergistic effects of the combination of LU and CC scenarios, and taking into account both of these is, therefore, critically important if model results are to be used for decision-making support.",https://doi.org/10.1007/s12665-019-8193-4,10.1007/s12665-019-8193-4,"Andaryani, Soghra; Trolle, Dennis; Nikjoo, M.

390,Flood Forecasting and Warning System Structures: Procedure and Application to a Small Urban Stream in South Korea,"The runoff from heavy rainfall reaches urban streams quickly, causing them to rise rapidly. It is therefore of great importance to provide sufficient lead time for evacuation planning and decision making. An efficient flood forecasting and warning method is crucial for ensuring adequate lead time. With this objective, this paper proposes an analysis method for a flood forecasting and warning system, and establishes the criteria for issuing urban-stream flash flood warnings based on the amount of rainfall to allow sufficient lead time. The proposed methodology is a nonstructural approach to flood prediction and risk reduction. It considers water level fluctuations during a rainfall event and estimates the upstream (alert point) and downstream (confluence) water levels for water level analysis based on the rainfall intensity and duration. We also investigate the rainfall/runoff and flow rate/water level relationships using the Hydrologic Engineering Center's Hydrologic Modeling System (HEC-HMS) and the HEC's River Analysis System (HEC-RAS) models, respectively, and estimate the rainfall threshold for issuing flash flood warnings depending on the backwater state based on actual watershed conditions. We present a methodology for issuing flash flood warnings at a critical point by considering the effects of fluctuations in various backwater conditions in real time, which will provide practical support for decision making by disaster protection workers. The results are compared with real-time water level observations of the Dorim Stream. Finally, we verify the validity of the flash flood warning criteria by comparing the predicted values with the observed values and performing validity analysis.",https://doi.org/10.3390/w11081571,10.3390/w11081571,"Song, Yangho; Park, Yoonkyung; Lee, Jungho; Park, Moojong; Song, Youngseok",WATER,flash flood forecasting; flood forecasting and warning system; flood warning criteria; rainfall; runoff,GENETIC PROGRAMMING-MODEL; RUNOFF,,MDPI,BASEL,"ST ALBAN-ANLAGE 66, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND",,2073-4441,,WATER-SUI,Water,AUG,2019,11,8,,,1571,
391,Spatial Bias in Medium-Range Forecasts of Heavy Precipitation in the Sacramento River Basin: Implications for Water Management,"Forecasts of heavy precipitation delivered by atmospheric rivers (ARs) are becoming increasingly important for both flood control and water supply management in reservoirs across California. This study examines the hypothesis that medium-range forecasts of heavy precipitation at the basin scale exhibit recurrent spatial biases that are driven by mesoscale and synoptic-scale features of associated AR events. This hypothesis is tested for heavy precipitation events in the Sacramento River basin using 36 years of NCEP medium-range reforecasts from 1984 to 2019. For each event we cluster precipitation forecast error across western North America for lead times ranging from 1 to 15 days. Integrated vapor transport (PVT), 500-hPa geopotential heights, and landfall characteristics of ARs are composited across clusters and lead times to diagnose the causes of precipitation forecast biases. We investigate the temporal evolution of forecast error to characterize its persistence across lead times, and explore the accuracy of forecasted IVT anomalies across different domains of the North American west coast during heavy precipitation events in the Sacramento basin. Our results identify recurrent spatial patterns of precipitation forecast error consistent with errors of forecasted synoptic-scale features, especially at long (5-15 days) leads. Moreover, we find evidence that forecasts of AR landfalls well outside of the latitudinal bounds of the Sacramento basin precede heavy precipitation events within the basin. These results suggest the potential for using medium-range forecasts of large-scale climate features across the Pacific-North American sector, rather than just local forecasts of basin-scale precipitation, when designing forecast-informed reservoir operations.",https://doi.org/10.1175/JHM-D-19-0226.1,10.1175/JHM-D-19-0226.1,"Brodeur, Zachary P.; Steinschneider, Scott",JOURNAL OF HYDROMETEOROLOGY,,US WEST-COAST; ATMOSPHERIC RIVERS; EXTREME PRECIPITATION; VAPOR TRANSPORT; CALIFORNIA; RESOURCES; IMPACTS; SCALE,,AMER METEOROLOGICAL SOC,BOSTON,"45 BEACON ST, BOSTON, MA 02108-3693 USA",1525-755X,1525-7541,,J HYDROMETEOROL,J.

These predictions provide guidance when to take an action such as the issuing of a warning. Real-time decision support systems, frequently designated as flood forecasting and warning systems, are used to organize the complex process of coupling data and models in real-time.

393,Assessing the value of seasonal hydrological forecasts for improving water resource management: insights from a pilot application in the UK,"Improved skill of long-range weather forecasts has motivated an increasing effort towards developing seasonal hydrological forecasting systems across Europe. Among other purposes, such forecasting systems are expected to support better water management decisions. In this paper we evaluate the potential use of a real-time optimization system (RTOS) informed by seasonal forecasts in a water supply system in the UK. For this purpose, we simulate the performances of the RTOS fed by ECMWF seasonal forecasting systems (SEAS5) over the past 10 years, and we compare them to a benchmark operation that mimics the common practices for reservoir operation in the UK. We also attempt to link the improvement of system performances, i.e. the forecast value, to the forecast skill (measured by the mean error and the continuous ranked probability skill score) as well as to the bias correction of the meteorological forcing, the decision maker priorities, the hydrological conditions and the forecast ensemble size. We find that in particular the decision maker priorities and the hydrological conditions exert a strong influence on the forecast skill-value relationship. For the (realistic) scenario where the decision maker prioritizes the water resource availability over energy cost reductions, we identify clear operational benefits from using seasonal forecasts, provided that forecast uncertainty is explicitly considered by optimizing against an ensemble of 25 equiprobable forecasts. These operational benefits are also observed when the ensemble size is reduced up to a certain limit However, when comparing the use of ECMWF-SEAS5 products to ensemble streamflow prediction (ESP), which is more easily derived from historical weather data, we find that ESP remains a hard-to-beat reference, not only in terms of skill but also in terms of value.",https://doi.org/10.5194/hess-24-6059-2020,10.5194/hess-24-6059-2020,"Penuela, Andres; Hutton, Christopher; Pianosi, Francesca",HYDROLOGY AND EARTH SYSTEM SCIENCES,,ENSEMBLE PREDICTION; SYSTEMS-ANALYSIS; STREAMFLOW; PERFORMANCE; SKILL; OPTIMIZATION; VERIFICATION; FUTURE; RAW,,COPERNICUS GESELLSCHAFT MBH,GOTTINGEN,"BAHNHOFSALLEE 1E, GOTTINGEN, 37081, GERMANY",1027-5606,1607-7938,,HYDROL EARTH SYST SC,Hydrol.

394,Predicting Energy Generation Using Forecasting Techniques in Catalan Reservoirs,"Reservoirs are natural or artificial lakes used as a source of water supply for society daily applications. In addition, hydroelectric power plants produce electricity while water flows through the reservoir. However, reservoirs are limited natural resources since water levels vary according to annual rainfalls and other natural events, and consequently, the energy generation. Therefore, forecasting techniques are helpful to predict water level, and thus, electricity production. This paper examines state-of-the-art methods to predict the water level in Catalan reservoirs comparing two approaches: using the water level uniquely, uni-variant; and adding meteorological data, multi-variant. With respect to relating works, our contribution includes a longer times series prediction keeping a high precision. The results return that combining Support Vector Machine and the multi-variant approach provides the highest precision with an R2value of 0.99.",https://doi.org/10.3390/en12101832,10.3390/en12101832,"Parada, Raul; Font, Jordi; Casas-Roma, Jordi",ENERGIES,forecasting; reservoir; series analysis,FUZZY INFERENCE SYSTEM; NEURAL-NETWORKS; LEVEL FLUCTUATIONS; TIME-SERIES; VARIABLES; INFLOW; MODEL,,MDPI,BASEL,"ST ALBAN-ANLAGE 66, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND",1996-1073,,,ENERGIES,Energies,MAY 2,2019,12,10,,,1832,
395,Forecasting Water Quality Index in Groundwater Using Artificial Neural Network,"Groundwater quality monitoring in the vicinity of drilling sites is crucial for the protection of water resources. Selected physicochemical parameters of waters were marked in the study. The water was collected from 19 wells located close to a shale gas extraction site. The water quality index was determined from the obtained parameters. A secondary objective of the study was to test the capacity of the artificial neural network (ANN) methods to model the water quality index in groundwater. The number of ANN input parameters was optimized and limited to seven, which was derived using a multiple regression model. Subsequently, using the stepwise regression method, models with ever fewer variables were tested. The best parameters were obtained for a network with five input neurons (electrical conductivity, pH as well as calcium, magnesium and sodium ions), in addition to five neurons in the hidden layer. The results showed that the use of the parameters is a convenient approach to modeling water quality index with satisfactory and appropriate accuracy. Artificial neural network methods exhibited the capacity to predict water quality index at the desirable level of accuracy (RMSE = 0.651258, R = 0.9992 and R-2 = 0.9984). Neural network models can thus be used to directly predict the quality of groundwater, particularly in industrial areas. This proposed method, using advanced artificial intelligence, can aid in water treatment and management. The novelty of these studies is the use of the ANN network to forecast WQI groundwater in an area in eastern Poland that was not previously studied-in Lublin.",https://doi.org/10.3390/en14185875,10.3390/en14185875,"Kulisz, Monika; Kujawska, Justyna; Przysucha, Bartosz; Cel, Wojciech",ENERGIES,artificial neural network; prediction; regressions; groundwater; water quality index,RIVER-BASIN; PREDICTION; VARIABLES; PLAIN,,MDPI,BASEL,"ST ALBAN-ANLAGE 66, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND",,1996-1073,,ENERGIES,Energies,SEP,2021,14,18,,,5875,
396,A deep learning-accelerated data assimilation and forecasting workflow for commercial-scale geologic carbon storage,"Fast assimilation of monitoring data to update forecasts of pressure buildup and carbon dioxide (CO2) plume migration under geologic uncertainties is a challenging problem in geologic carbon storage. The high computational cost of data assimilation with a high-dimensional parameter space impedes fast decision-making for commercial-scale reservoir management. We propose to leverage physical understandings of porous medium flow behavior with deep learning techniques to develop a fast data assimilation-reservoir response forecasting workflow. Applying an Ensemble Smoother Multiple Data Assimilation (ES-MDA) framework, the workflow updates geologic properties and predicts reservoir performance with quantified uncertainty from pressure history and CO2 plumes interpreted through seismic inversion. As the most computationally expensive component in such a workflow is reservoir simulation, we developed surrogate models to predict dynamic pressure and CO2 plume extents under multi-well injection. The surrogate models employ deep convolutional neural networks, specifically, a wide residual network and a residual U-Net. The workflow is validated against a flat three-dimensional reservoir model representative of a elastic shelf depositional environment. Intelligent treatments are applied to bridge between quantities in a true-3D reservoir model and those in a single-layer reservoir model. The workflow can complete history matching and reservoir forecasting with uncertainty quantification in less than one hour on a mainstream personal workstation.",https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ijggc.2021.103488,10.1016/j.ijggc.2021.103488,"Tang, Hewei; Fu, Pengcheng; Sherman, Christopher S.; Zhang, Jize; Ju, Xin; Hamon, Francois; Azzolina, Nicholas A.; Burton-Kelly, Matthew; Morris, Joseph P.",INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF GREENHOUSE GAS CONTROL,Deep learning; Data assimilation; Geologic carbon storage; Ensemble-based methods; Surrogate modeling,LOW-DIMENSIONAL REPRESENTATION; PRINCIPAL COMPONENT ANALYSIS; ENCODER-DECODER NETWORKS; DIFFERENTIABLE PARAMETERIZATION; UNCERTAINTY QUANTIFICATION; CO2; EFFICIENT; WATER; FLOW,,ELSEVIER SCI LTD,OXFORD,"THE BOULEVARD, LANGFORD LANE, KIDLINGTON, OXFORD OX5 1GB, OXON, ENGLAND",1750-5836,1878-0148,,INT J GREENH GAS CON,Int.

In Canada, each province is responsible for collecting and managing meteorological and hydrometric data (through provincial authorities and/or under Federal/Provincial agreements), developing suitable hydrological models, and providing information about river discharge and water level to the public. In case of an extreme event such as flood or drought, the forecast center is responsible for issuing alerts and supporting provincial emergency management. Due to the large diversity in landscape, weather, and hydrological features across the country, extreme events are triggered by different mechanisms such as snowmelt, heavy rainfall, rain on snow, etc., at different times of the year. Each river forecast center deals with unique challenges in data collection, hydrologic/hydraulic modeling, and flood forecasting. Thus, the focus of the Center in planning for developments and future directions could be significantly different from one province to another. In this paper, the significance of river flood forecasting in Canada, as well as the development in hydrological modelling procedures are highlighted. Moreover, an overview of the current approaches for streamflow/flood forecasting used by the Centers is provided. The content presented here is an outcome of our interaction with the forecast centers. This further resulted in identifying a number of research questions to help bridge the gap between ongoing research and needs of the Centers.",https://doi.org/10.1080/07011784.2019.1601598,10.1080/07011784.2019.1601598,"Zahmatkesh, Zahra; Jha, Sanjeev Kumar; Coulibaly, Paulin; Stadnyk, Tricia",CANADIAN WATER RESOURCES JOURNAL,Hydrologic modeling procedure; Canadian river flood forecast centers; Procedure de modelisation hydrologique; Centres Canadiens de prevision des crues des rivieres,MODELING TECHNIQUES; BASIN; RISK; VULNERABILITY; MANAGEMENT; MANITOBA; WETLANDS,,TAYLOR & FRANCIS INC,PHILADELPHIA,"530 WALNUT STREET, STE 850, PHILADELPHIA, PA 19106 USA",0701-1784,1918-1817,,CAN WATER RESOUR J,Can.

399,Monthly runoff time series prediction by variational mode decomposition and support vector machine based on quantum-behaved particle swarm optimization,"Accurate monthly runoff prediction plays an important role in the planning and management of water resources. However, owing to climate changes and human activities, natural runoff often contains a variety of frequency components, and existing monthly runoff estimation techniques may fail to capture potential change processes effectively. To overcome this problem, we have developed a hybrid model for monthly runoff prediction. First, observed runoff is decomposed into several subcomponents via variational mode decomposition. Second, support vector machine models based on quantum-behaved particle swarm optimization are adopted to identify the input-output relationships hidden in each subcomponent. Finally, the total output of all submodules is treated as the final forecasting result for the original runoff. Three quantitative indexes are considered to test the performance of the developed models. The monthly streamflow of two reservoirs in China's Yangtze Valley is considered as the survey target. This area contains the world's largest hydropower project (Three Gorges Reservoir) and the waterhead of the middle line of Asia's largest inter-basin water transfer project (Danjiangkou Reservoir). Test results indicate that the hybrid model provides better forecasting accuracy compared to several traditional methods (artificial neural networks and extreme learning machines), making it an effective tool for the scientific operation of hydropower reservoirs.",https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jhydrol.2020.124627,10.1016/j.jhydrol.2020.124627,"Feng, Zhong-kai; Niu, Wen-jing; Tang, Zheng-yang; Jiang, Zhi-qiang; Xu, Yang; Liu, Yi; Zhang, Hai-rong",JOURNAL OF HYDROLOGY,Monthly runoff prediction; Decomposition and ensemble; Machine learning technique; Swarm intelligence method; Three Gorges and Danjiangkou Reservoirs,CASCADE HYDROPOWER STATIONS; MEMRISTIVE NEURAL-NETWORKS; CLIMATE-CHANGE IMPACTS; OPTIMAL OPERATION; ARTIFICIAL-INTELLIGENCE; TERM; ALGORITHM; RESERVOIR; RULES; CLASSIFICATION,,ELSEVIER,AMSTERDAM,"RADARWEG 29, 1043 NX AMSTERDAM, NETHERLANDS",0022-1694,1879-2707,,J HYDROL,J.

400,Changes in river water resources of the Russian Federation's economic regions forecasted based on the CMIP5 runoff data,"The article presents predictive estimates of changes in river water resources in eleven economic regions of the Russian Federation for the period of 2030 and 2050 based on the use of river runoff data of the atmospheric and ocean general circulation models (AOGCM) of the CMIP5 project. An overview of the design schemes of the AOGCM river runoff used in the research is made. The methodology uses an ensemble approach. The predictive estimates were carried out for two forecast periods 2021-2040 and 2041-2060 in relation to the period 1981-20 0 0, which was chosen as the base one. The calculations were made on the basis of an ensemble of 24 selected models for both the moderately aggressive RCP4.5 scenario and the hard RCP8.5 scenario. The results obtained were averaged over 20-year periods and compared with the corresponding values for the period 1981-20 0 0. According to the results obtained, in the coming decades there is no reason to expect any significant changes in river flow as a result of climate change. For most of the country's territory, a slight increase in annual runoff is most likely, which is within the limits of its natural variability. The most abundant river water resources will be the Asian part of the Russian Federation and the adjacent eastern part of the European territory of Russia. The most problematic from the point of view of water resources provision will be the Central Black Earth, North Caucasus and Volga economic regions. There will be more water in those regions where it is sufficient, and less where it is most needed. It should be noted that the technique presented in this article is considered by the authors primarily as one of the alternative forecasting methods that must be used in conjunction with other accepted methods. However, given the continuous process of improving the AOGCMs, as well as the quality of the information they provide, this approach should be considered as one of the most promising.

401,Evaluation of four hydrological models for operational flood forecasting in a Canadian Prairie watershed,"The complexities of the Prairie watersheds, including potholes, drainage interconnectivities, changing land-use patterns, dynamic watershed boundaries and hydro-meteorological factors, have made hydrological modelling on Prairie watersheds one of the most complex task for hydrologists and operational hydrological forecasters. In this study, four hydrological models (WATFLOOD, HBV-EC, HSPF and HEC-HMS) were developed, calibrated and tested for their efficiency and accuracy to be used as operational flood forecasting tools. The Upper Assiniboine River, which flows into the Shellmouth Reservoir, Canada, was selected for the analysis. The performance of the models was evaluated by the standard statistical methods: the Nash-Sutcliffe efficiency coefficient, correlation coefficient, root mean squared error, mean absolute relative error and deviation of runoff volumes. The models were evaluated on their accuracy in simulating the observed runoff for calibration and verification periods (2005-2015 and 1994-2004, respectively) and also their use in operational forecasting of the 2016 and 2017 runoff.",https://doi.org/10.1080/02626667.2018.1474219,10.1080/02626667.2018.1474219,"Unduche, Fisaha; Tolossa, Habtamu; Senbeta, Degefa; Zhu, Eric",HYDROLOGICAL SCIENCES JOURNAL-JOURNAL DES SCIENCES HYDROLOGIQUES,Prairie watershed; hydrological model; hydrological forecasting; Shellmouth basin; hydrological forecast centre; hydrological model evaluation,SNOWMELT INFILTRATION; AUTOMATIC CALIBRATION; RIVER-BASIN; HEC-HMS; STREAMFLOW; WARNINGS; RUNOFF; SOIL,,TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD,ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OR14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0262-6667,2150-3435,,HYDROLOG SCI J,Hydrol.

402,Short-term forecasting of monthly water consumption in hyper-arid climate using recurrent neural networks,"Freshwater supply is a major challenge in regions with limited water resources and extremely arid climatic conditions. The objective of this study is to model the monthly water demand in Kuwait using the nonlinear autoregressive with exogenous input (NARX) neural network approach. The country lacks conventional surface water resources and is characterized by extremely arid climate. In addition, it has one of the fastest growing populations. In this study, linear detrending is performed on the water consumption time series for the period from January 1993 to December 2018 to eliminate the influence of population growth before application to the NARX model. Monthly temperature data are selected as exogenous input to the NARX model, because they are strongly associated with the water consumption data. Correlation analyses are performed to determine the input and feedback delays of the NARX model. The results demonstrate that the recurrent NARX model is efficient and robust for forecasting the short-term water demand, with a Nash-Sutcliffe (NS) coefficient of 0.837 in the validation period. Seasonal model assessment shows that the model performs best during the critical summer season. The NARX-based recurrent model is established as a powerful and promising tool for predicting urban water demand. Thus, it can efficiently aid the development of resilient water supply plans.",https://doi.org/10.36909/jer.v9i3A.10893,10.36909/jer.v9i3A.10893,"Alsumaiei, Abdullah A.",JOURNAL OF ENGINEERING RESEARCH,Water supply modeling; NARX model; Linear detrending; Water footprint; Developing countries,DEMAND; PREDICTION; RESOURCES; SCARCITY; IMPACT; MODEL; CITY; ANN,,ACADEMIC PUBLICATION COUNCIL,KHALDIYA,"PO BOX 17225, KHALDIYA 72453, KUWAIT",2307-1877,2307-1885,,J ENG RES-KUWAIT,J.

403,Streamflow forecast sensitivity to air temperature forecast calibration for 139 Norwegian catchments,"In this study, we used meteorological ensemble forecasts as input to hydrological models to quantify the uncertainty in forecasted streamflow, with a particular focus on the effect of temperature forecast calibration on the streamflow ensemble forecast skill. In catchments with seasonal snow cover, snowmelt is an important flood-generating process. Hence, high-quality air temperature data are important to accurately forecast streamflows. The sensitivity of streamflow ensemble forecasts to the calibration of temperature ensemble forecasts was investigated using ensemble forecasts of temperature from the European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts (ECMWF) covering a period of nearly 3 years, from 1 March 2013 to 31 December 2015. To improve the skill and reduce biases of the temperature ensembles, the Norwegian Meteorological Institute (MET Norway) provided parameters for ensemble calibration, derived using a standard quantile mapping method where HIRLAM, a high-resolution regional weather prediction model, was used as reference. A lumped HBV (Hydrologiska Byrans Vatten-balansavdelning) model, distributed on 10 elevation zones, was used to estimate the streamflow. The results show that temperature ensemble calibration affected both temperature and streamflow forecast skill, but differently depending on season and region. We found a close to 1 : 1 relationship between temperature and streamflow skill change for the spring season, whereas for autumn and winter large temperature skill improvements were not reflected in the streamflow forecasts to the same degree. This can be explained by streamflow being less affected by subzero temperature improvements, which accounted for the biggest temperature biases and corrections during autumn and winter. The skill differs between regions. In particular, there is a cold bias in the forecasted temperature during autumn and winter along the coast, enabling a large improvement by calibration. The forecast skill was partly related to elevation differences and catchment area. Overall, it is evident that temperature forecasts are important for streamflow forecasts in climates with seasonal snow cover.",https://doi.org/10.5194/hess-23-723-2019,10.5194/hess-23-723-2019,"Hegdahl, Trine J.; Engeland, Kolbjorn; Steinsland, Ingelin; Tallaksen, Lena M.",HYDROLOGY AND EARTH SYSTEM SCIENCES,,ENSEMBLE PREDICTION; RANK HISTOGRAMS; MODEL; ECMWF; UNCERTAINTIES; PRECIPITATION; FLOODS,,COPERNICUS GESELLSCHAFT MBH,GOTTINGEN,"BAHNHOFSALLEE 1E, GOTTINGEN, 37081, GERMANY",1027-5606,1607-7938,,HYDROL EARTH SYST SC,Hydrol.

404,Streamflow drought: implication of drought definitions and its application for drought forecasting,"Streamflow drought forecasting is a key element of contemporary drought early warning systems (DEWS). The term streamflow drought forecasting (not streamflow forecasting), however, has created confusion within the scientific hydrometeorological community as well as in operational weather and water management services. Streamflow drought forecasting requires an additional step, which is the application of a drought identification method to the forecasted streamflow time series. The way streamflow drought is identified is the main reason for this misperception. The purpose of this study, therefore, is to provide a comprehensive overview of the differences between different drought identification approaches to identify droughts in European rivers, including an analysis of both historical drought and implications for forecasting. Streamflow data were obtained from the LISFLOOD hydrological model forced with gridded meteorological observations (known as LISFLOOD-Simulation Forced with Observed, SFO). The same model fed with seasonal meteorological forecasts of the European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts system 5 (ECMWF SEAS 5) was used to obtain the forecasted streamflow. Streamflow droughts were analyzed using the daily and monthly variable threshold methods (VTD and VTM, respectively), the daily and monthly fixed threshold methods (FTD and FTM, respectively), and the Standardized Streamflow Index (SSI). Our results clearly show that streamflow droughts derived from different approaches deviate from each other in their characteristics, which also vary in different climate regions across Europe. The daily threshold methods (FTD and VTD) identify 25 %-50 % more drought events than the monthly threshold methods (FTM and VTM), and accordingly the average drought duration is longer for the monthly than for the daily threshold methods. The FTD and FTM, in general, identify drought occurrences earlier in the year than the VTD and VTM. In addition, the droughts obtained with the VTM and FTM approaches also have higher drought deficit volumes (about 25 %-30 %) than the VTD and FTD approaches. Overall, the characteristics of SSI-1 drought are close to what is being identified by the VTM. The different outcome obtained with the drought identification methods illustrated with the historical analysis is also found in drought forecasting, as documented for the 2003 drought across Europe and for the Rhine River specifically. In the end, there is no unique hydrological drought definition (identification method) that fits all purposes, and hence developers of DEWS and end-users should clearly agree in the co-design phase upon a sharp definition of which type of streamflow drought is required to be forecasted for a specific application.",https://doi.org/10.5194/hess-25-3991-2021,10.5194/hess-25-3991-2021,"Sutanto, Samuel J.; Van Lanen, Henny A.

405,Environmental flows and its satisfaction degree forecasting in the Yellow River,"Assessment of suitable environmental flows (EFs) and its satisfaction degree is significant for water resources management. We presented a forecasting framework for EFs, IFA and EF satisfaction degree to assess suitable EFs (minimum or threshold) and forecast EF satisfaction degree over the next 20 years. First, we investigated the temporal and spatial distribution characteristics of IFA using statistical analysis and Morlet wavelet analysis of the hydrologic series from 1919 to 2013. Second, forecasting models of IFA were established using hydrologic stochastic simulation based on wavelet analysis. Then, abrupt shifts of baseflow index (BI) were identified based on Mann-Kendall trend detection test. Subsequently, regressions models were developed between a normalized BI and the effect size (ES) of zoobenthos and fish species richness. Accordingly, EFs were calculated. Finally, the IFA and EF satisfaction degree for the forecasting years were calculated. Results show that thresholds of BI, with 0.8 and 0.4 as the lower limit, and 2.3 and 1.1 as the upper limit, were recommended as the limit percentage of the EFs standard during flood and non-flood seasons, respectively. An overall decreasing tendency of IFA was observed in all the seven stations from the 1910s to 2010s, which is especially particularly significant in the lower reaches in the past two or three decades. One major EFs deficit spell occurred throughout the river beginning in the 1990s. Forecasting results indicate that the IFA will satisfy the EFs for the stations located in the upper and middle reaches by 2020 and 2030, except for the stations in the lower reaches. Contradictions of EFs and IFA will be even graver in the future. The results will have important implications for the water management of the riverine ecosystem. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd.

406,"Using satellite remote sensing to improve the prediction of scallop condition in their natural environment: Case study for Georges Bank, Canada","The continuous, synoptical and high spatio-temporal resolution of thermal and visible satellite observations constitute an asset when characterizing and monitoring biogeochemical cycles in the oceans. In particular, they provide a unique insight into the hydrodynamics of the surface ocean and phytoplankton phenology. This information can be combined with in-situ observations of higher trophic levels to understand the functioning of the marine ecosystem, with potential use for fisheries and aquaculture. In the Gulf of Maine, off the eastern seaboard of North America, Georges Bank is one of the world's most productive natural sea scallop (Placopecten magellanicus) fisheries, which sustains economically valuable fisheries in Canada and the US. In Canada, the relationship between the scallop meat weight and its shell height (known as scallop condition) is used to obtain biomass estimates for stock assessment and thereby influences the fishing quotas. On Georges Bank, for a 100 mm shell height scallop, scallop condition has varied significantly interannually between 10.2 g and 19.5 g. Establishing a relationship between environmental factors and scallop condition would improve the forecasting of scallop biomass and reduce the uncertainty when determining the total allowable catch for the subsequent fishing season. In this study, satellite remote-sensed sea-surface temperature (SST) and chlorophyll-a concentration (Chia) coupled with in-situ measurements of scallop condition (SC) on Georges Bank were used to assess the relationship between SC and satellite-derived environmental conditions between 1985 and 2019 for SST and between 1998 and 2019 for Chla. The inter-annual variation of SC in May was found to be positively correlated (p-value <0.001) with the variation in SST in winter-spring months of the current and previous year of the SC survey. An empirical linear model for the estimation of SC was developed and validated using two independent datasets of satellite SST (r(2) = 0.64, MAPD = 7%). Another model using cumulative SST in the previous year only was also provided (r(2) = 0.58, MAPD = 7.7%), which could serve as an alternative choice when the SST products in the current year are not yet available for use. There was a weak relationship observed between SC and Chla; this is likely due to the influence of water-column vertical mixing on transport of phytoplankton to the benthic zone where the sea scallop resides. Our study indicates that a cost-effective satellite-derived SST product can be used to improve predictions of SC and provide useful information and decision support tools for managing scallop stocks.",https://doi.org/10.1016/j.rse.2020.112251,10.1016/j.rse.2020.112251,"Liu, Xiaohan; Devred, Emmanuel; Johnson, Catherine L.; Keith, Dave; Sameoto, Jessica A.",REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT,Scallop; Sea-surface temperature; Remote sensing; Phytoplankton; Fishery,PLACOPECTEN-MAGELLANICUS; SEA SCALLOP; ECOLOGICAL ENERGETICS; FOOD AVAILABILITY; TEMPERATURE; PHYTOPLANKTON; OCEAN; ABSORPTION; HABITAT; GROWTH,,ELSEVIER SCIENCE INC,NEW YORK,"STE 800, 230 PARK AVE, NEW YORK, NY 10169 USA",0034-4257,1879-0704,,REMOTE SENS ENVIRON,Remote Sens.

Data-driven modelling has gained popularity among petroleum engineering professionals by turning big data into valuable insights that introduces fast and reliable decision making. In this study, a viscosifying polymer flooding performance-forecasting tool is developed using an artificial neural network-based data-driven model. A wide variety of reservoir and operational scenarios are generated to inclusively cover possible conditions of the process. Each scenario goes through no injection, water-only flooding, polymer followed by waterflooding and polymer-only flooding schemes. Neural network models were trained with three representative performance indicators derived from simulator outputs; efficiency, water-cut and recovery factor. Practicality of the tool in assessing probabilistic and deterministic predictions is demonstrated with a real polymer-flooding case of Daqing Oil Field.",https://doi.org/10.1504/IJOGCT.2021.115801,10.1504/IJOGCT.2021.115801,"Zarepakzad, Negar; Artun, Emre; Durgut, Ismail",INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF OIL GAS AND COAL TECHNOLOGY,reservoir simulation; chemical enhanced oil recovery; polymer flooding; artificial neural networks; ANNs; data-driven modelling; screening model,SCREENING CRITERIA; RECOVERY; FIELD; VISCOSITY,,INDERSCIENCE ENTERPRISES LTD,GENEVA,"WORLD TRADE CENTER BLDG, 29 ROUTE DE PRE-BOIS, CASE POSTALE 856, CH-1215 GENEVA, SWITZERLAND",1753-3309,1753-3317,,INT J OIL GAS COAL T,Int.

408,Relative effects of statistical preprocessing and postprocessing on a regional hydrological ensemble prediction system,"The relative roles of statistical weather preprocessing and streamflow postprocessing in hydrological ensemble forecasting at short-to medium-range forecast lead times (day 1-7) are investigated. For this purpose, a regional hydrologic ensemble prediction system (RHEPS) is developed and implemented. The RHEPS is comprised of the following components: (i) hydrometeorological observations (multisensor precipitation estimates, gridded surface temperature, and gauged streamflow); (ii) weather ensemble forecasts (precipitation and near-surface temperature) from the National Centers for Environmental Prediction 11-member Global Ensemble Forecast System Re-forecast version 2 (GEFSRv2); (iii) NOAA's Hydrology Laboratory-Research Distributed Hydrologic Model (HL-RDHM); (iv) heteroscedastic censored logistic regression (HCLR) as the statistical preprocessor; (v) two statistical postprocessors, an autoregressive model with a single exogenous variable (ARX(1,1)) and quantile regression (QR); and (vi) a comprehensive verification strategy. To implement the RHEPS, 1 to 7 days weather forecasts from the GEFSRv2 are used to force HL-RDHM and generate raw ensemble streamflow forecasts. Forecasting experiments are conducted in four nested basins in the US Middle Atlantic region, ranging in size from 381 to 12 362 km(2). Results show that the HCLR preprocessed ensemble precipitation forecasts have greater skill than the raw forecasts. These improvements are more noticeable in the warm season at the longer lead times (>3 days). Both postprocessors, ARX(1,1) and QR, show gains in skill relative to the raw ensemble streamflow forecasts, particularly in the cool season, but QR outperforms ARX(1,1). The scenarios that implement preprocessing and postprocessing separately tend to perform similarly, although the postprocessing-alone scenario is often more effective. The scenario involving both preprocessing and postprocessing consistently outperforms the other scenarios. In some cases, however, the differences between this scenario and the scenario with postprocessing alone are not as significant. We conclude that implementing both preprocessing and postprocessing ensures the most skill improvements, but postprocessing alone can often be a competitive alternative.",https://doi.org/10.5194/hess-22-1831-2018,10.5194/hess-22-1831-2018,"Sharma, Sanjib; Siddique, Ridwan; Reed, Seann; Ahnert, Peter; Mendoza, Pablo; Mejia, Alfonso",HYDROLOGY AND EARTH SYSTEM SCIENCES,,MODEL INTERCOMPARISON PROJECT; EXTENDED LOGISTIC-REGRESSION; MID-ATLANTIC REGION; STREAMFLOW FORECASTS; QUANTILE REGRESSION; BIAS CORRECTION; PRECIPITATION; UNCERTAINTY; RIVER; TEMPERATURE,,COPERNICUS GESELLSCHAFT MBH,GOTTINGEN,"BAHNHOFSALLEE 1E, GOTTINGEN, 37081, GERMANY",1027-5606,1607-7938,,HYDROL EARTH SYST SC,Hydrol.

409,"Comparison of short-term streamflow forecasting using stochastic time series, neural networks, process-based, and Bayesian models","Streamflow forecasts are essential for water resources management. Although there are many methods for forecasting streamflow, real-time forecasts remain challenging. This study evaluates streamflow forecasts using a process-based model (Soil and Water Assessment Tool-Variable Source Area model-SWAT-VSA), a stochastic model (Artificial Neural Network -ANN), an Auto-Regressive Moving-Average (ARMA) model, and a Bayesian ensemble model that utilizes the SWAT-VSA, ANN, and ARMA results. Streamflow is forecast from 1 to 8 d, forced with Quantitative Precipitation Forecasts from the US National Weather Service. Of the individual models, SWAT-VSA and the ANN provide better predictions of total streamflow (NSE 0.60-0.70) and peak flow, but underpredicted low flows. During the forecast period the ANN had the highest predictive power (NSE 0.44-0.64), however all three models underpredicted peak flow.

410,Sourcing CHIRPS precipitation data for streamflow forecasting using intrinsic time-scale decomposition based machine learning models,"This study evaluated the effectiveness of Climate Hazards Group InfraRed Precipitation with Station (CHIRPS) satellite rainfall data for the development of multi-step ahead streamflow forecasting models. Daily time scale precipitation data of nearly three decades (1986-2012) over the Varahi river basin in Western Ghats of Karnataka, India were used for the analysis. Machine learning (ML) models, namely, the Group Method of Data Handling (GMDH), Chi-square Automatic Interaction Detector (CHAID), and Random Forest (RF) were simulated for one, three and seven days ahead streamflow forecasting. Additionally, the developed forecasting models were improved through the integration with Intrinsic Time-scale decomposition (ITD) (by decomposing the input data into a series of proper rotation components (PRC) and a monotonic trend). The uniqueness of this study lies in coupling ITD with machine learning models to forecast daily streamflow time-series. Concurrently, the precipitation data derived from India Meteorological Department (IMD) gridded rainfall dataset were also employed for developing analogous multistep ahead streamflow forecasting models. The proposed methodology was aimed to have an accurate and a reliable forecasting model that can assist water resources management and operation. Comparative performance evaluation using various statistical indices portrayed the superiority of CHIRPS satellite rainfall data product in forecasting daily streamflows up to a week lead time. The results indicate that, the hybrid ITD-based ML models developed using CHIRPS precipitation data as inputs held a better performance at all lead times.",https://doi.org/10.1080/02626667.2021.1928138,10.1080/02626667.2021.1928138,"Wang, Maofa; Rezaie-Balf, Mohammad; Naganna, Sujay Raghavendra; Yaseen, Zaher Mundher",HYDROLOGICAL SCIENCES JOURNAL-JOURNAL DES SCIENCES HYDROLOGIQUES,streamflow forecasting; intrinsic time-scale decomposition; CHIRPS precipitation; Chi-square automatic interaction detector; random forest; GMDH,ARTIFICIAL NEURAL-NETWORK; RIVER FLOW; PASSIVE MICROWAVE; RAINFALL DATA; HYBRID MODEL; FLASH-FLOOD; PREDICTION; SATELLITE; RUNOFF; ENSEMBLE,,TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD,ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OR14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0262-6667,2150-3435,,HYDROLOG SCI J,Hydrol.

411,Meteolakes: An operational online three-dimensional forecasting platform for lake hydrodynamics,"Environmental management depends on high-quality monitoring and its meaningful interpretation. The combination of local weather dynamics, regional anthropogenic stresses and global environmental changes make the evaluation of monitoring information in dynamic freshwater systems a challenging task. While the lake ecosystems gather many complex biogeochemical interactions, they remain constrained by the same physical environment of mixing and transport. It is therefore crucial to obtain high quality physical system insight. Three-dimensional hydrodynamic models are perfectly suited for providing such information. However, these models are complex to implement, and their use is often limited to modellers. Here, we aim to provide model output via a user-friendly platform to a broad audience ranging from scientists to public and governmental stakeholders. We present a unified approach merging the apparently diverse interests through meteolakes.ch, an online platform openly disseminating lake observations and three-dimensional numerical simulations in near real-time with short-term forecasts and data assimilation. Meteolakes is scalable to a broad range of devices, modular and distributed, hence allowing its expansion to other regions and hardware infrastructures. Since 2016, the platform has continuously provided timely synoptic lake information to more than 250,000 users. This web-based system was built not only to provide guidance to scientists in the design and analysis of field experiments and to foster interdisciplinary lake studies, but also to assist governmental agencies and professionals in the long-term policy and planning of water resources management. Finally, our system aimed at promoting awareness and understanding of the complexity of lakes and providing information to the public through user-friendly, interfaces. This article details the design and operation of such a platform and its products. Applications are demonstrated by examples of a recent upwelling and a storm event. Both cases illustrate how Meteolakes help scientists in their quest for process understanding as well as water professionals and civil society in providing specific warnings. (C) 2020 The Authors.

412,Prediction of daily reservoir inflow using atmospheric predictors,"Reservoir systems need the forecast of rainfall and inflow on daily time scale for planning of water allocation to different users. Prediction of daily rainfall or daily reservoir inflow is a challenging task in water resource management. This study aims at forecasting the daily reservoir inflow using the projections of atmospheric variables extracted from the global climatic models as input. Daily rainfall series for the future period is simulated using a calibrated weather generator based on generalized linear models. The simulated daily rainfall series are compared with the monthly predictions obtained from local polynomial regression model, and the best correlated daily rainfall simulation is transformed into stream flow using a calibrated and validated soil and water assessment tool to generate the daily inflow series. The modelling procedure was applied to a typical reservoir catchment in India. Diagnostic checks carried out to assess the performance of the rainfall simulations revealed that the simulated series are having the same statistical characteristics as that of the observed series. The simulated inflow was found to be acceptable with respect to the performance indicators evaluated in the study. The methodology adopted is data driven, flexible and easy to implement.",https://doi.org/10.1007/s40899-019-00323-4,10.1007/s40899-019-00323-4,"George, Jany; Janaki, Letha; Gomathy, Jairaj Parameswaran",SUSTAINABLE WATER RESOURCES MANAGEMENT,Daily reservoir inflow; Atmospheric predictors; Simulation; Generalized linear models; Global climatic models,CLIMATE; RIVER; MODEL; PRECIPITATION; GENERATION,,SPRINGER INTERNATIONAL PUBLISHING AG,CHAM,"GEWERBESTRASSE 11, CHAM, CH-6330, SWITZERLAND",2363-5037,2363-5045,,SUST WAT RESOUR MAN,Sustain.

413,Ensemble forecasting system for the management of the Senegal River discharge: application upstream the Manantali dam,"Providing useful inflow forecasts of the Manantali dam is critical for zonal consumption and agricultural water supply, power production, flood and drought control and management (Shin et al., Meteorol Appl 27:e1827, 2019). Probabilistic approaches through ensemble forecasting systems are often used to provide more rational and useful hydrological information. This paper aims at implementing an ensemble forecasting system at the Senegal River upper the Manantali dam. Rainfall ensemble is obtained through harmonic analysis and an ARIMA stochastic process. Cyclical errors that are within rainfall cyclical behavior from the stochastic modeling are settled and processed using multivariate statistic tools to dress a rainfall ensemble forecast. The rainfall ensemble is used as input to run the HBV-light to product streamflow ensemble forecasts. A number of 61 forecasted rainfall time series are then used to run already calibrated hydrological model to produce hydrological ensemble forecasts called raw ensemble. In addition, the affine kernel dressing method is applied to the raw ensemble to obtain another ensemble. Both ensembles are evaluated using on the one hand deterministic verifications such the linear correlation, the mean error, the mean absolute error and the root-mean-squared error, and on the other hand, probabilistic scores (Brier score, rank probability score and continuous rank probability score) and diagrams (attribute diagram and relative operating characteristics curve). Results are satisfactory as at deterministic than probabilistic scale, particularly considering reliability, resolution and skill of the systems. For both ensembles, correlation between the averages of the members and corresponding observations is about 0.871. In addition, the dressing method globally improved the performances of ensemble forecasting system. Thus, both schemes system can help decision maker of the Manantali dam in water resources management.",https://doi.org/10.1007/s13201-020-01199-y,10.1007/s13201-020-01199-y,"Ndione, Didier Maria; Sambou, Soussou; Kane, Seidou; Diatta, Samo; Sane, Mousse Landing; Leye, Issa",APPLIED WATER SCIENCE,Senegal river; Manantali dam; ARIMA; Ensemble forecasting; Affine kernel dressing,STREAMFLOW; RAINFALL; MODELS; VERIFICATION; TEMPERATURE; RELIABILITY; CATCHMENT; REGION; BASIN,,SPRINGER HEIDELBERG,HEIDELBERG,"TIERGARTENSTRASSE 17, D-69121 HEIDELBERG, GERMANY",2190-5487,2190-5495,,APPL WATER SCI,Appl.

414,Predicting River Flow Using an AI-Based Sequential Adaptive Neuro-Fuzzy Inference System,"Artificial intelligence (AI) techniques have been successfully adopted in predictive modeling to capture the nonlinearity of natural systems. The high seasonal variability of rivers in cold weather regions poses a challenge to river flow forecasting, which tends to be complex and data demanding. This study proposes a novel technique to forecast flows that use a single-input sequential adaptive neuro-fuzzy inference system (ANFIS) along the Athabasca River in Alberta, Canada. After estimating the optimal lead time between four hydrometric stations, gauging data measured near the source were used to predict river flow near the mouth, over approximately 1000 km. The performance of this technique was compared to nonsequential and multi-input ANFISs, which use gauging data measured at each of the four hydrometric stations. The results show that a sequential ANFIS can accurately predict river flow (r(2)= 0.99, Nash-Sutcliffe = 0.98) with a longer lead time (6 days) by using a single input, compared to nonsequential and multi-input ANFIS (2 days). This method provides accurate predictions over large distances, allowing for flow forecasts over longer periods of time. Therefore, governmental agencies and community planners could utilize this technique to improve flood prevention and planning, operations, maintenance, and the administration of water resource systems.",https://doi.org/10.3390/w12061622,10.3390/w12061622,"Belvederesi, Chiara; Dominic, John A.; Hassan, Quazi K.; Gupta, Anil; Achari, Gopal",WATER,ANFIS; hydrological modeling; Athabasca River; water resources; predictive modeling,CLIMATE-CHANGE IMPACTS; UNCERTAINTY; ANFIS; BASIN; STREAMFLOW; CALIBRATION; CATCHMENT; ALBERTA,,MDPI,BASEL,"ST ALBAN-ANLAGE 66, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND",,2073-4441,,WATER-SUI,Water,JUN,2020,12,6,,,1622,
415,A novel attention-based LSTM cell post-processor coupled with bayesian optimization for streamflow prediction,"Streamflow forecasting is critical for real-time water resources management and flood early warning. In this study, we introduce a novel attention-based Long-Short Term Memory (LSTM) cell deep learning (DL) model for postprocessing streamflow simulations which will herein be referred to as Self-activated and Internal Attention LSTM, or SAINA-LSTM. In this model, we incorporate an improved self-attention mechanism into the inner structure of the LSTM cell to increase focus on the more important time points, thereby enhancing the information flow of the cell. Performance of the SAINA-LSTM is then compared against that of the current National Weather Service's operational streamflow forecast ensemble postprocessor (EnsPost), a recently-developed multiscale alternative (MS-EnsPost), a robust machine learning algorithm (Gradient Boosting), and two other deep learning algorithms (LSTM and Gated Recurrent Unit (GRU)). Forecast performance in four basins in different climatological regimes of the United States are compared. Several deterministic evaluation metrics are examined for one to seven-day-ahead predictions of daily flows. SAINA-LSTM reduce the biases in simulations of low, medium, and high daily flows. The other two deep learning models also outperform EnsPost and MS-EnsPost in most cases. The results highlight the relatively poor performance of EnsPost, particularly in low flow conditions. Generally, the novel SAINA-LSTM model outperforms other models in low, medium, and high ranges of flow and for 1- to 7-day ahead forecasts in all three highly nonlinear and non-snow-driven study basins. In snowdriven basins, due to low nonlinearity, the three deep learning models are relatively comparable and significantly improved over statistical models. The results of the comparative evaluation demonstrate the capability of SAINA-LSTM to reduce the RMSE of daily-predicted flow by up to 20 percent compared to MS-EnsPost. The promising result shown here is a motivation for extending this research to also cover ensemble forecasting using the novel model developed in this work.",https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jhydrol.2021.126526,10.1016/j.jhydrol.2021.126526,"Alizadeh, Babak; Bafti, Alireza Ghaderi; Kamangir, Hamid; Zhang, Yu; Wright, Daniel B.; Franz, Kristie J.",JOURNAL OF HYDROLOGY,Streamflow prediction; Deep learning; Attention mechanism; Machine learning; Statistical post-processing; EnsPost,SHORT-TERM-MEMORY; VARIATIONAL MODE DECOMPOSITION; FORECASTING-MODEL; WATER; HYDROLOGY,,ELSEVIER,AMSTERDAM,"RADARWEG 29, 1043 NX AMSTERDAM, NETHERLANDS",0022-1694,1879-2707,,J HYDROL,J.

416,Iterative Forecasting Improves Near-Term Predictions of Methane Ebullition Rates,"Near-term, ecological forecasting with iterative model refitting and uncertainty partitioning has great promise for improving our understanding of ecological processes and the predictive skill of ecological models, but to date has been infrequently applied to predict biogeochemical fluxes. Bubble fluxes of methane (CH4) from aquatic sediments to the atmosphere (ebullition) dominate freshwater greenhouse gas emissions, but it remains unknown how best to make robust near-term CH4 ebullition predictions using models. Near-term forecasting workflows have the potential to address several current challenges in predicting CH4 ebullition rates, including: development of models that can be applied across time horizons and ecosystems, identification of the timescales for which predictions can provide useful information, and quantification of uncertainty in predictions. To assess the capacity of near-term, iterative forecasting workflows to improve ebullition rate predictions, we developed and tested a near-term, iterative forecasting workflow of CH4 ebullition rates in a small eutrophic reservoir throughout one open-water period. The workflow included the repeated updating of a CH4 ebullition forecast model over time with newly-collected data via iterative model refitting. We compared the CH4 forecasts from our workflow to both alternative forecasts generated without iterative model refitting and a persistence null model. Our forecasts with iterative model refitting estimated CH4 ebullition rates up to 2 weeks into the future [RMSE at 1-week ahead = 0.53 and 0.48 log(e)(mg CH4 m(-2) d(-1)) at 2-week ahead horizons]. Forecasts with iterative model refitting outperformed forecasts without refitting and the persistence null model at both 1- and 2-week forecast horizons. Driver uncertainty and model process uncertainty contributed the most to total forecast uncertainty, suggesting that future workflow improvements should focus on improved mechanistic understanding of CH4 models and drivers. Altogether, our study suggests that iterative forecasting improves week-to-week CH4 ebullition predictions, provides insight into predictability of ebullition rates into the future, and identifies which sources of uncertainty are the most important contributors to the total uncertainty in CH4 ebullition predictions.",https://doi.org/10.3389/fenvs.2021.756603,10.3389/fenvs.2021.756603,"McClure, Ryan P.; Thomas, R.

417,Streamflow Forecasting Using Singular Value Decomposition and Support Vector Machine for the Upper Rio Grande River Basin,"The current study improves streamflow forecast lead-time by coupling climate information in a data-driven modeling framework. The spatial-temporal correlation between streamflow and oceanic-atmospheric variability represented by sea surface temperature (SST), 500-mbar geopotential height (Z(500)), 500-mbar specific humidity (SH500), and 500-mbar east-west wind (U-500) of the Pacific and the Atlantic Ocean is obtained through singular value decomposition (SVD). SVD significant regions are weighted using a nonparametric method and utilized as input in a support vector machine (SVM) framework. The Upper Rio Grande River Basin (URGRB) is selected to test the applicability of the proposed model for the period of 1965-2014. The April-August streamflow volume is forecasted using previous year climate variability, creating a lagged relationship of 1-13 months. SVD results showed the streamflow variability was better explained by SST and U-500 as compared to Z(500) and SH500. The SVM model showed satisfactory forecasting ability with best results achieved using a one-month lead to forecast the following four-month period. Overall, the SVM results showed excellent predictive ability with average correlation coefficient of 0.89 and Nash-Sutcliffe efficiency of 0.79. This study contributes toward identifying new SVD significant regions and improving streamflow forecast lead-time of the URGRB.",https://doi.org/10.1111/1752-1688.12733,10.1111/1752-1688.12733,"Bhandari, Swastik; Thakur, Balbhadra; Kalra, Ajay; Miller, William P.; Lakshmi, Venkat; Pathak, Pratik",JOURNAL OF THE AMERICAN WATER RESOURCES ASSOCIATION,oceanic-atmospheric variability; streamflow; forecast; singular value decomposition; support vector machine,WESTERN NORTH-AMERICA; CLIMATE-CHANGE; WATER-RESOURCES; UNITED-STATES; VARIABILITY; MODEL; PATTERNS; PACIFIC; DROUGHT; TELECONNECTIONS,,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",1093-474X,1752-1688,,J AM WATER RESOUR AS,J.

418,Monthly Streamflow Forecasting Using Convolutional Neural Network,"Monthly streamflow forecasting is vital for managing water resources. Recently, numerous studies have explored and evidenced the potential of artificial intelligence (AI) models in hydrological forecasting. In this study, the feasibility of the convolutional neural network (CNN), a deep learning method, is explored for monthly streamflow forecasting. CNN can automatically extract critical features from numerous inputs with its convolution-pooling mechanism, which is a distinct advantage compared with other AI models. Hydrological and large-scale atmospheric circulation variables, including rainfall, streamflow, and atmospheric circulation factors are used to establish models and forecast streamflow for Huanren Reservoir and Xiangjiaba Hydropower Station, China. The artificial neural network (ANN) and extreme learning machine (ELM) with inputs identified based on cross-correlation and mutual information analyses are established for comparative analyses. The performances of these models are assessed with several statistical metrics and graphical evaluation methods. The results show that CNN outperforms ANN and ELM in all statistical measures.

419,Verification of two hydrological models for real-time flood forecasting in the Hindu Kush Himalaya (HKH) region,"The Hindu Kush Himalayan region is extremely susceptible to periodic monsoon floods. Early warning systems with the ability to predict floods in advance can benefit tens of millions of people living in the region. Two web-based flood forecasting tools (ECMWF-SPT and HIWAT-SPT) are therefore developed and deployed jointly by SERVIR-HKH and NASA-AST to provide early warning to Bangladesh, Bhutan, and Nepal. ECMWF-SPT provides ensemble forecast up to 15-day lead time, whereas HIWAT-SPT provides deterministic forecast up to 3-day lead time covering almost 100% of the rivers. Hydrological models in conjunction with forecast validation contribute not only to advancing the processes of a forecasting system, but also objectively assess the joint distribution of forecasts and observations in quantifying forecast accuracy. The validation of forecast products has emerged as a priority need to evaluate the worth of the predictive information in terms of quality and consistency. This paper describes the effort made in developing the hydrological forecast systems, the current state of the flood forecast services, and the performance of the forecast evaluation. Both tools are validated using a selection of appropriate metrics in measurement in both probabilistic and deterministic space. The numerical metrics are further complemented by graphical representations of scores and probabilities. It was found that the models had a good performance in capturing high flood events. The evaluation across multiple locations indicates that the model performance and forecast goodness are variable on spatiotemporal scale. The resulting information is used to support good decision-making in risk and resource management.",https://doi.org/10.1007/s11069-021-05014-y,10.1007/s11069-021-05014-y,"Tsering, Karma; Shrestha, Manish; Shakya, Kiran; Bajracharya, Birendra; Matin, Mir; Lozano, Jorge Luis Sanchez; Nelson, Jim; Wangchuk, Tandin; Parajuli, Binod; Bhuyan, Md Arifuzzaman",NATURAL HAZARDS,Early warning system; GLoFAS-SPT; Forecast validation; Hindu Kush Himalayan; HIWAT-SPT,ENSEMBLE; PRECIPITATION; SYSTEM,,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"ONE NEW YORK PLAZA, SUITE 4600, NEW YORK, NY, UNITED STATES",0921-030X,1573-0840,,NAT HAZARDS,Nat.

420,Generating Synthetic Streamflow Forecasts with Specified Precision,"Synthetic hydrologic forecasts are often needed to evaluate water resources planning and management strategies when appropriate historical forecasts are not available. Synthetic forecasts can be generated to evaluate system performance with existing forecast products over historical periods when they were not available, or with different forecast products that do not yet exist. Synthetic forecast generation procedures should produce forecasts that are realistic and have the desired statistical properties. Two synthetic forecast generation techniques are proposed that create a time series of forecasts with (1)the desired mean, (2)the correct variance, and (3)the desired forecast precision. One uses a classical stochastic hydrology approach, and the other the generalized maintenance of variance extension (GMOVE) concept using historical hydrologic series as input. A critique is provided of several published synthetic forecast generation algorithms that produced unrealistic results. The GMOVE methodology is used in a stochastic optimization model of a single reservoir hydropower system. Using forecasts of varying precision, the example illustrates the ability of more precise forecasts to improve system operations.",https://doi.org/10.1061/(ASCE)WR.1943-5452.0000915,10.1061/(ASCE)WR.1943-5452.0000915,"Lamontagne, J.

421,Analysis and forecasting of rivers pH level using deep learning,"The pH level of oceans has been largely monitored and studied to make sure that aquatic ecosystems are thriving. However, the pH level of other large bodies of waters, such as rivers, has largely been glanced over. Many rivers contain very sensitive underwater ecosystems, and as a result even small pH changes can largely impact the relative biodiversity. With the addition of increased carbon emissions and pollution, large bodies of water are absorbing more carbon and consequently the pH levels of rivers can rapidly change. This paper studies different deep learning approaches to analyze and forecast pH levels, which include a long short-term memory (LSTM), gated recurrent unit (GRU), recurrent neural network (RNN), and a Temporal Fusion Transformer (TFT) model to determine which algorithm provides the best pH predictive forecast. We demonstrate that the TFT outperforms other deep learning methods through various metrics. In addition, we clarify the importance of temperature as a feature in pH prediction. Lastly, we use the TFT to predict pH anomalies and discover the significance of the predicted data. We found that nine out of the ten predicted data sets have a significant difference compared to the original data.",https://doi.org/10.1007/s13748-021-00270-2,10.1007/s13748-021-00270-2,"Srivastava, Abhay; Cano, Alberto",PROGRESS IN ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE,pH Analysis; Temporal Fusion Transformer; Deep learning; Machine learning,PREDICTION,,SPRINGERNATURE,LONDON,"CAMPUS, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON, N1 9XW, ENGLAND",2192-6352,2192-6360,,PROG ARTIF INTELL,Prog.

422,Future Temperature Extremes Will Be More Harmful: A New Critical Factor for Improved Forecasts,"There is increasing evidence that extreme weather events such as frequent and intense cold spells and heat waves cause unprecedented deaths and diseases in both developed and developing countries. Thus, they require extensive and immediate research to limit the risks involved. Average temperatures in Europe in June-July 2019 were the hottest ever measured and attributed to climate change. The problem, however, of a thorough study of natural climate change is the lack of experimental data from the long past, where anthropogenic activity was then very limited. Today, this problem can be successfully resolved using, inter alia, biological indicators that have provided reliable environmental information for thousands of years in the past. The present study used high-resolution quantitative reconstruction data derived from biological records of Lake Silvaplana sediments covering the period 1181-1945. The purpose of this study was to determine whether a slight temperature change in the past could trigger current or future intense temperature change or changes. Modern analytical tools were used for this purpose, which eventually showed that temperature fluctuations were persistent. That is, they exhibit long memory with scaling behavior, which means that an increase (decrease) in temperature in the past was always followed by another increase (decrease) in the future with multiple amplitudes. Therefore, the increase in the frequency, intensity, and duration of extreme temperature events due to climate change will be more pronounced than expected. This will affect human well-being and mortality more than that estimated in today's modeling scenarios. The scaling property detected here can be used for more accurate monthly to decadal forecasting of extreme temperature events. Thus, it is possible to develop improved early warning systems that will reduce the public health risk at local, national, and international levels.",https://doi.org/10.3390/ijerph16204015,10.3390/ijerph16204015,"Costas, Varotsos A.; Yuri, Mazei A.",INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH AND PUBLIC HEALTH,extreme temperature events; biological indicators; climate change; public health,SCALING BEHAVIOR; GLOBAL SIGNATURE; CLIMATE; RECORD; DYNAMICS; MEMORY; LAKE; SST,,MDPI,BASEL,"ST ALBAN-ANLAGE 66, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND",,1660-4601,,INT J ENV RES PUB HE,Int.

423,Household-level effects of providing forecast-based cash in anticipation of extreme weather events: Quasi-experimental evidence from humanitarian interventions in the 2017 floods in Bangladesh,"In 2017, Bangladesh experienced the worst floods in recent decades. Based on a forecast and pre-defined trigger level, a Red Cross Red Crescent project distributed an unconditional cash grant of BDT 5000 (USD 60 equivalent) to 1039 poor households in highly vulnerable, flood-prone communities in the Brahmaputra river basin before an early flood peak. Systems that can deliver forecast-based cash grants are a potential adaptation strategy to deal with changes in extreme events linked to climate change. This paper presents the results of a mixed-methods, quasi-experimental study, based on a post-disaster household survey. The research assesses the effectiveness of the forecast-based cash distribution in helping beneficiaries to take preparatory early actions and reduce the negative impacts of the flood on their health, well-being, assets and livelihoods. The assessment shows that the cash grants contributed to improving households' access to food, a reduction in high-interest debt accrual of vulnerable households, and reduced psychosocial stress during and after the flood period, compared to a control group of similarly vulnerable and flood-affected communities that did not receive the forecast-based cash assistance. The intervention may also have prevented households from being forced to make destitution sales of valuable assets, as indicated by qualitative data collected in July, but we do not see these benefits sustained after a second flood peak in August 2017. There is a need for further research to assess the longer-term effects of forecast-based cash on the socio-economic development and well-being of the most vulnerable.",https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ijdrr.2019.101275,10.1016/j.ijdrr.2019.101275,"Gros, Clemens; Bailey, Meghan; Schwager, Saroja; Hassan, Ahmadul; Zingg, Raymond; Uddin, Muhammad Mamtaz; Shahjahan, Mohammad; Islam, Hasibul; Lux, Stefanie; Jaime, Catalina; de Perez, Erin Coughlan",INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF DISASTER RISK REDUCTION,Cash transfer; Climate adaptation; Vulnerability; Forecast; Floods; Bangladesh,CLIMATE; SYSTEMS; LIVES,,ELSEVIER,AMSTERDAM,"RADARWEG 29, 1043 NX AMSTERDAM, NETHERLANDS",2212-4209,,,INT J DISAST RISK RE,Int.

In hydrology, wavelet analysis (WA) is known as a new method for time series analysis. In this study, WA was combined with an artificial neural network (ANN) for prediction of precipitation at Varayeneh station, western Iran. The results obtained were compared with the adaptive neural fuzzy inference system (ANFIS) and ANN. Moreover, data on relative humidity and temperature were employed in addition to rainfall data to examine their influence on precipitation forecasting. Overall, this study concluded that the hybrid WANN model outperformed the other models in the estimation of maxima and minima, and is the best at forecasting precipitation.

425,Validating Dynamically Downscaled Climate Projections for Mountainous Watersheds Using Historical Runoff Data Coupled with the Distributed Hydrologic Soil Vegetation Model (DHSVM),"The performance of dynamically downscaled climate fields with respect to observed historical stream runoff has been assessed at basin scale using a physically distributed hydrologic model (DHSVM). The dynamically downscaled climate fields were generated by running the Weather Research & Forecasting (WRF) model at 4-km horizontal resolution with boundary conditions derived from the Climate Forecast System Reanalysis. Six hydrologic models were developed using DHSVM for six mountainous tributary watersheds of the Jordan River basin at hourly time steps and 30-m spatial resolution. The size of the watersheds varies from 19 km(2) to 130 km(2). The models were calibrated for a 6-year period from water year (WY) 1999-2004, using the observed meteorological data from the nearby Snow Telemetry (SNOTEL) sites of the Natural Resources Conservation Services (NRCS). Calibration results showed a very good fit between simulated and observed streamflow with an average Nash-Sutcliffe Efficiency (NSE) greater than 0.77, and good to very good fits in terms of other statistical parameters like percent bias (PBIAS) and coefficient of determination (R-2). A 9-year period (WY 2001-2009) was selected as the historical baseline, and stream discharges for this period were simulated using dynamically downscaled climate fields as input to the calibrated hydrologic models. Historical baseline results showed a satisfactory fit of simulated and observed streamflow with an average NSE greater than 0.45 and a coefficient of determination above 0.50. Using volumetric analysis, it has been found that the total volume of water simulated using downscaled climate projections for the entire historical baseline period for all six watersheds is 4% less than the observed amount representing a very good estimation in terms of percent error volume (PEV). However, in the case of individual watersheds, analysis of total annual water volumes showed that estimated total annual water volumes were higher than the observed for Big Cottonwood, City Creek, Millcreek and lower than the observed total annual volume of water for Little Cottonwood, Red Butte Creek, and Parleys Littledell, demonstrating similar characteristics obtained from the calibration results. Seasonal analysis showed that the models can capture the flow volume observed for Big Cottonwood, City Creek and Red Butte Creek during the peak season, and the models can capture the flow volume observed for all the watershed satisfactorily except Big Cottonwood during the dry season. Study results indicated that the dynamically downscaled climate projections used in this study performed satisfactorily in terms of stream runoff, total flow volume, and seasonal flow analyses based on different statistical tests, and can satisfactorily capture flow patterns and flow volume for most of the watersheds considering the uncertainties associated with the study.",https://doi.org/10.3390/w12051389,10.3390/w12051389,"Hasan, Mohammad M.; Strong, Courtenay; Kochanski, Adam K.; Burian, Steven J.; Barber, Michael E.",WATER,water supply; Jordan River basin; streamflow prediction; climate projections; spatial and temporal variations,SOLAR-RADIATION; PRECIPITATION; AVAILABILITY; CALIFORNIA; SENSITIVITY; RESISTANCE; RESOURCES; SNOWMELT; IMPACTS,,MDPI,BASEL,"ST ALBAN-ANLAGE 66, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND",,2073-4441,,WATER-SUI,Water,MAY,2020,12,5,,,1389,
426,Monthly streamflow forecasting based on hidden Markov model and Gaussian Mixture Regression,"Reliable streamflow forecasts can be highly valuable for water resources planning and management. In this study, we combined a hidden Markov model (HMM) and Gaussian Mixture Regression (GMR) for probabilistic monthly streamflow forecasting. The HMM is initialized using a kernelized K-medoids clustering method, and the Baum-Welch algorithm is then executed to learn the model parameters. GMR derives a conditional probability distribution for the predictand given covariate information, including the antecedent flow at a local station and two surrounding stations. The performance of HMM-GMR was verified based on the mean square error and continuous ranked probability score skill scores. The reliability of the forecasts was assessed by examining the uniformity of the probability integral transform values. The results show that HMM-GMR obtained reasonably high skill scores and the uncertainty spread was appropriate. Different HMM states were assumed to be different climate conditions, which would lead to different types of observed values. We demonstrated that the HMM-GMR approach can handle multimodal and heteroscedastic data.",https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jhydrol.2018.03.057,10.1016/j.jhydrol.2018.03.057,"Liu, Yongqi; Ye, Lei; Qin, Hui; Hong, Xiaofeng; Ye, Jiajun; Yin, Xingli",JOURNAL OF HYDROLOGY,Gaussian Mixture Regression; Hidden Markov model; Kernelized K-medoids clustering; Probabilistic streamflow forecasting,NEURAL-NETWORK MODELS; RUNOFF,,ELSEVIER SCIENCE BV,AMSTERDAM,"PO BOX 211, 1000 AE AMSTERDAM, NETHERLANDS",0022-1694,1879-2707,,J HYDROL,J.

427,Monthly streamflow forecasting using artificial intelligence approach: a case study in a semi-arid region of India,"Accurate and reliable streamflow forecasting is paramount in the field of water resource planning and management, especially in semi-arid regions. However, streamflow time series are highly complex and non-linear in nature; traditional or physical-based models may fail to capture the complexity and maintain the robustness of the datasets. Therefore, the present study aims to improve the forecasting accuracy and reduce the uncertainty in the datasets by using the data-driven approach such as artificial neural network (ANN) that can efficiently handle the non-linearity in the large and complex hydrological data. This study method includes two steps: i.e., first to develop the ANN models using different combinations of inputs such as rainfall, temperature, and streamflow lag by one or two and then to validate the developed models to forecast the streamflow by using a total of four performance evaluation indices such as correlation coefficient (R), root mean square error (RMSE), modified Nash-Sutcliff efficiency (MNSE), and modified index of agreement (MIA). The proposed method is demonstrated in Jakham reservoir located in Pratapgarh district, Rajasthan, India, for improving the accuracy of monthly streamflow forecasting over a 40-year period (1975-2015). We found that increasing the number of input parameters improves the accuracy of the model and enhance its performance. According to the results, the ANN models 5 and 6 (M-5 and M-6) showed significant variation in the performance evaluation criteria. This clearly indicates that ANN model with an input combination of lag one or two streamflow (i.e., model M-5 and M-6) is performed better when compared to a model that incorporates only monthly rainfall and monthly lag one or two rainfall as inputs. Overall, the application of ANN models M-5 and M-6 (with lag one and two streamflow as an input) can forecast monthly streamflow forecasting with better accuracy.",https://doi.org/10.1007/s12517-021-08778-6,10.1007/s12517-021-08778-6,"Sharma, Priyanka; Madane, Dnyaneshwar; Bhakar, S.

428,Extended-Range Runoff Forecasting Using a One-Way Coupled Climate-Hydrological Model: Case Studies of the Yiluo and Beijiang Rivers in China,"Extended-range runoff forecasting is important for water resources management and energy planning. Experimental extended-range runoff was hindcasted, based on an extended-range climate model, developed by National Climate Center of the China Meteorological Administration, and semi-distributed hydrological model HBV-D. The skill of the runoff forecasts was explored using mean square skill score (MSSS), anomaly correlation coefficient (ACC), and areas under the relative operating characteristics curve (AUC) for three terciles for three experimental 51-day periods during flood season (June 1 to July 21, July 1 to August 20 and August 1 to September 20) for two rivers in China. The results revealed decreasing trends of the five indices, and varying length of the continuous longest skilful time slice from 3 days to 6 weeks depending on index, period and river location. In most cases, skilful abnormal terciles forecast occurred more often or with similar frequency to deterministic forecasts. It suggests that ensemble probability forecasting is a method with potential for extended-range river runoff forecast. Further, abnormal terciles are more skillful than normal terciles, and above normal are more skillful than below normal. In terms of a temporal mean of the MSSS and ACC, deterministic forecasts are skillful for both rivers in all three periods, but more skillful for the Beijiang River than for the Yiluo River in most cases.",https://doi.org/10.3390/w11061150,10.3390/w11061150,"Liu, Lueliu; Xiao, Chan; Du, Liangmin; Zhang, Peiqun; Wang, Guofu",WATER,extended-range runoff forecast; DERF2; 0; HBV; Yiluo River; Beijiang River,ENSEMBLE PREDICTION SYSTEM; STREAMFLOW; UNCERTAINTY; ACCURACY; IMPACTS; BASINS; SKILL,,MDPI,BASEL,"ST ALBAN-ANLAGE 66, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND",2073-4441,,,WATER-SUI,Water,JUN,2019,11,6,,,,
429,An interactive Web-GIS fluvial flood forecast and alert system in operation in Portugal,"Floods are one of the natural disasters not preventable, affecting people and causing significant damage to economic activities and infrastructures. Thus, it is of foremost importance to, within a disaster risk-reduction strategy, develop a useful flood forecast and alert system to prevent people from suffering flood disasters and mitigate its consequences. This article presents the Flood Forecast and Alert System in operational mode since 2019 for the ' Agueda river basin located in Portugal's centre region. This system is technologically advanced, differing from others since it uses a coupled real-time hydrologic and 2D hydrodynamic modelling supported on numerical weather prediction and a high-resolution digital terrain surface model. The system components are automatically activated and linked: i) a rainfall forecasting model (WRF), ii) a hydrological model (HEC-HMS), iii) a hydraulic model (HEC-RAS 2D), and a iv) Web-GIS platform. The hydrological model is forced with forecast precipitation for the next three days and updated every 6 h, which is crucial to generate pre-flood hazard maps. It also includes a Web GIS service for flood hazard dissemination available for civil authorities and citizens. A flood forecast and alert system is highly relevant to the community since, by enhancing knowledge, it provides the authorities responsible for assessing and managing the flood risk, responsiveness to disasters and timely decisionmaking, which is even more evident in the context of climate change.",https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ijdrr.2021.102201,10.1016/j.ijdrr.2021.102201,"Mourato, Sandra; Fernandez, Paulo; Marques, Fabio; Rocha, Alfredo; Pereira, Luisa",INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF DISASTER RISK REDUCTION,Flood alert; Flood forecasting; Flood hazard; Hydrological and hydrodynamic modelling; Meteorological forecasting; Web services,ENSEMBLE PREDICTION SYSTEM; PLANETARY BOUNDARY-LAYER; DISASTER RISK-MANAGEMENT; WARNING SYSTEM; DISTRIBUTED MODEL; TOPOGRAPHIC DATA; FINITE-ELEMENT; CLIMATE-CHANGE; HEC-HMS; INUNDATION,,ELSEVIER,AMSTERDAM,"RADARWEG 29, 1043 NX AMSTERDAM, NETHERLANDS",2212-4209,,,INT J DISAST RISK RE,Int.

430,Input attributes optimization using the feasibility of genetic nature inspired algorithm: Application of river flow forecasting,"In nature, streamflow pattern is characterized with high non-linearity and non-stationarity. Developing an accurate forecasting model for a streamflow is highly essential for several applications in the field of water resources engineering. One of the main contributors for the modeling reliability is the optimization of the input variables to achieve an accurate forecasting model. The main step of modeling is the selection of the proper input combinations. Hence, developing an algorithm that can determine the optimal input combinations is crucial. This study introduces the Genetic algorithm (GA) for better input combination selection. Radial basis function neural network (RBFNN) is used for monthly streamflow time series forecasting due to its simplicity and effectiveness of integration with the selection algorithm. In this paper, the RBFNN was integrated with the Genetic algorithm (GA) for streamflow forecasting. The RBFNN-GA was applied to forecast streamflow at the High Aswan Dam on the Nile River. The results showed that the proposed model provided high accuracy. The GA algorithm can successfully determine effective input parameters in streamflow time series forecasting.",https://doi.org/10.1038/s41598-020-61355-x,10.1038/s41598-020-61355-x,"Afan, Haitham Abdulmohsin; Allawi, Mohammed Falah; El-Shafie, Amr; Yaseen, Zaher Mundher; Ahmed, Ali Najah; Malek, Marlinda Abdul; Koting, Suhana Binti; Salih, Sinan Q.; Mohtar, Wan Hanna Melini Wan; Lai, Sai Hin; Sefelnasr, Ahmed; Sherif, Mohsen; El-Shafie, Ahmed",SCIENTIFIC REPORTS,,SUPPORT VECTOR MACHINES; NEURAL-NETWORK MODELS; PREDICTION MODEL; INFLOW; FUZZY; STREAMFLOW; RESERVOIR; RUNOFF,,NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP,LONDON,"MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",2045-2322,,,SCI REP-UK,Sci Rep,MAR 13,2020,10,1,,,4684,
431,Hybrid Models Combining EMD/EEMD and ARIMA for Long-Term Streamflow Forecasting,"Long-term streamflow forecast is of great significance for water resource application and management. However, accurate monthly streamflow forecasting is challenging due to its non-stationarity and uncertainty. Time series analysis methods have been proved to perform well in stationary time series forecasting, which can be derived from decomposition of the non-stationary sequence. As common decomposition methods in time domain, Empirical Mode Decomposition (EMD) and Ensemble Empirical Mode Decomposition (EEMD) are selected to decompose the components with different time-scale characteristics in the original hydrological time series in this study. The derived components are proved to be stationary by the stationarity test. Thus, Autoregressive Integrated Moving Average (ARIMA) model, a simple and effective time series analysis method, is used to forecast the components. A hybrid EMD/EEMD-ARIMA model is proposed in this study for long-term streamflow forecasting, which is applied to the upper stream of the Yellow River. The original daily streamflow time series of six years at the Tangnaihai station are firstly decomposed by EMD/EEMD into several stationary or simple non-stationary sub-series to explore detailed data information with different time scales. ARIMA models with appropriate parameters are then established for each subsequence to forecast the stream flow of the next year. Predicted ten-day and monthly stream flow is finally obtained combing the predictions of all the components. The EMD-ARIMA hybrid model performs best in forecasting high and moderate value of streamflow and fits best with the observation compared with EEMD-ARIMA and ARIMA models. The results not only verify the effectiveness of the proposed hybrid EMD/EEMD-ARIMA model in exploiting comprehensive information to improve the prediction but also indicate that the EMD-ARIMA model with end points disposal performs the best and can be used for long-term hydrological forecasting.",https://doi.org/10.3390/w10070853,10.3390/w10070853,"Wang, Zhi-Yu; Qiu, Jun; Li, Fang-Fang",WATER,long-term streamflow forecasting; empirical mode decomposition (EMD); ensemble empirical mode decomposition (EEMD); Autoregressive Integrated Moving Average (ARIMA); hybrid model,ARTIFICIAL NEURAL-NETWORKS; UNCERTAINTY ANALYSIS; MARKOV MODEL; RIVER FLOW; DECOMPOSITION; RUNOFF; ENSEMBLE; RAINFALL; FUZZY; PRECIPITATION,,MDPI,BASEL,"ST ALBAN-ANLAGE 66, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND",,2073-4441,,WATER-SUI,Water,JUL,2018,10,7,,,853,
432,The development and evaluation of a hydrological seasonal forecast system prototype for predicting spring flood volumes in Swedish rivers,"Hydropower makes up nearly half of Sweden's electrical energy production. However, the distribution of the water resources is not aligned with demand, as most of the inflows to the reservoirs occur during the spring flood period. This means that carefully planned reservoir management is required to help redistribute water resources to ensure optimal production and accurate forecasts of the spring flood volume (SFV) is essential for this. The current operational SFV forecasts use a historical ensemble approach where the HBV model is forced with historical observations of precipitation and temperature. In this work we develop and test a multi-model prototype, building on previous work, and evaluate its ability to forecast the SFV in 84 sub-basins in northern Sweden. The hypothesis explored in this work is that a multi-model seasonal forecast system incorporating different modelling approaches is generally more skilful at forecasting the SFV in snow dominated regions than a forecast system that utilises only one approach. The testing is done using cross-validated hindcasts for the period 1981-2015 and the results are evaluated against both climatology and the current system to determine skill. Both the multi-model methods considered showed skill over the reference forecasts. The version that combined the historical modelling chain, dynamical modelling chain, and statistical modelling chain performed better than the other and was chosen for the prototype. The prototype was able to outperform the current operational system 57% of the time on average and reduce the error in the SFV by similar to 6% across all sub-basins and forecast dates.",https://doi.org/10.5194/hess-22-2953-2018,10.5194/hess-22-2953-2018,"Foster, Kean; Uvo, Cintia Bertacchi; Olsson, Jonas",HYDROLOGY AND EARTH SYSTEM SCIENCES,,ENSEMBLE STREAMFLOW PREDICTION; PRECIPITATION FORECASTS; MODELING APPROACH; WATER-RESOURCES; UNITED-STATES; SKILL; PROJECTIONS; ELASTICITY; IMPROVE; SWEDEN,,COPERNICUS GESELLSCHAFT MBH,GOTTINGEN,"BAHNHOFSALLEE 1E, GOTTINGEN, 37081, GERMANY",1027-5606,1607-7938,,HYDROL EARTH SYST SC,Hydrol.

433,Flash Flood Forecasting Based on Long Short-Term Memory Networks,"Flash floods occur frequently and distribute widely in mountainous areas because of complex geographic and geomorphic conditions and various climate types. Effective flash flood forecasting with useful lead times remains a challenge due to its high burstiness and short response time. Recently, machine learning has led to substantial changes across many areas of study. In hydrology, the advent of novel machine learning methods has started to encourage novel applications or substantially improve old ones. This study aims to establish a discharge forecasting model based on Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks for flash flood forecasting in mountainous catchments. The proposed LSTM flood forecasting (LSTM-FF) model is composed of T multivariate single-step LSTM networks and takes spatial and temporal dynamics information of observed and forecast rainfall and early discharge as inputs. The case study in Anhe revealed that the proposed models can effectively predict flash floods, especially the qualified rates (the ratio of the number of qualified events to the total number of flood events) of large flood events are above 94.7% at 1-5 h lead time and range from 84.2% to 89.5% at 6-10 h lead-time. For the large flood simulation, the small flood events can help the LSTM-FF model to explore a better rainfall-runoff relationship. The impact analysis of weights in the LSTM network structures shows that the discharge input plays a more obvious role in the 1-h LSTM network and the effect decreases with the lead-time. Meanwhile, in the adjacent lead-time, the LSTM networks explored a similar relationship between input and output. The study provides a new approach for flash flood forecasting and the highly accurate forecast contributes to prepare for and mitigate disasters.",https://doi.org/10.3390/w12010109,10.3390/w12010109,"Song, Tianyu; Ding, Wei; Wu, Jian; Liu, Haixing; Zhou, Huicheng; Chu, Jinggang",WATER,flash flood forecasting; long short-term memory; recurrent neural networks; machine learning,THRESHOLD; MODEL; SUPPORT; TIME,,MDPI,BASEL,"ST ALBAN-ANLAGE 66, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND",,2073-4441,,WATER-SUI,Water,JAN,2020,12,1,,,109,
434,HUP-BMA: An Integration of Hydrologic Uncertainty Processor and Bayesian Model Averaging for Streamflow Forecasting,"Uncertainty quantification and providing probabilistic streamflow forecasts are of particular interest for water resource management. The hydrologic uncertainty processor (HUP) is a well-known Bayesian approach used to quantify hydrologic uncertainty based on observations and deterministic forecasts. This uncertainty quantification is model-specific; however, utilizing information from multiple hydrologic models should be advantageous and should lead to better probabilistic forecasts. Using seven, structurally different, conceptual models, this study first aims at evaluating the effects of implementing different hydrologic models on HUP performance. Second, using the concepts of the Bayesian Model Averaging (BMA) approach, a multimodel HUP-based Bayesian postprocessor (HUP-BMA) is proposed where the combination of posterior distributions derived from HUP with different hydrologic models are used to better quantify the hydrologic uncertainty. All postprocessing approaches are applied for medium-range daily streamflow forecasting (1-14 days ahead) in two watersheds located in Ontario, Canada. The results indicate that the HUP forecasts for short lead-times are negligibly affected by implementing different hydrologic models, while with increasing lead-time and flow magnitude, they significantly depend on the quality of the deterministic forecast. Moreover, the superiority of the proposed HUP-BMA method over HUP is demonstrated based on various verification metrics in both watersheds. Additionally, HUP-BMA outperformed the original BMA in quantifying hydrologic uncertainty for short lead-times. However, by increasing lead-time, considering the effects of initially observed flow on HUP-BMA formulation may not be beneficial. So, its modified version unconditioned on initial observations is preferred.",https://doi.org/10.1029/2020WR029433,10.1029/2020WR029433,"Darbandsari, Pedram; Coulibaly, Paulin",WATER RESOURCES RESEARCH,uncertainty; streamflow forecasting; Bayesian Model Averaging; hydrologic uncertainty processor,PRECIPITATION ANALYSIS CAPA; PERFORMANCE CRITERIA; OBJECTIVE FUNCTIONS; ENSEMBLE; RIVER; MULTIMODEL; DECOMPOSITION; ASSIMILATION; VALIDATION; CALIBRATE,,AMER GEOPHYSICAL UNION,WASHINGTON,"2000 FLORIDA AVE NW, WASHINGTON, DC 20009 USA",0043-1397,1944-7973,,WATER RESOUR RES,Water Resour.

Therefore, there is need to develop a reliable and precise model for streamflow forecasting. The precision of Artificial Intelligence (AI) models can be improved by using hybrid AI models which consist of coupled models. Therefore, the chief aim of this study is to propose efficient hybrid system by integrating Grey Wolf Optimization (GWO) algorithm with Artificial Intelligence (AI) models. 130 years of monthly historical natural streamflow data will be used to evaluate the performance of the proposed modelling technique. Quantitative performance indicators will be introduced to evaluate the validity of the integrated models; in addition to that, comprehensive analysis will be conducted between the predicted and the observed streamflow. The results show the integrated AI with GWO outperform the standard AI methods and can make better forecasting during training and testing phases for the monthly inflow in all input cases. This finding reveals the superiority of GWO meta-heuristic algorithm in improving the accuracy of the standard AI in forecasting the monthly inflow.",https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jhydrol.2019.124435,10.1016/j.jhydrol.2019.124435,"Tikhamarine, Yazid; Souag-Gamane, Doudja; Ahmed, Ali Najah; Kisi, Ozgur; El-Shafie, Ahmed",JOURNAL OF HYDROLOGY,Streamflow; Estimation; Evolutionary algorithms; Aswan High Dam,SUPPORT VECTOR MACHINE; FUZZY INFERENCE SYSTEM; MONTHLY RIVER FLOW; NEURAL-NETWORK; HYBRID MODELS; FIREFLY ALGORITHM; MONTHLY INFLOW; PERFORMANCE; SIMULATION; PREDICTION,,ELSEVIER,AMSTERDAM,"RADARWEG 29, 1043 NX AMSTERDAM, NETHERLANDS",0022-1694,1879-2707,,J HYDROL,J.

436,Drivers and Subseasonal Predictability of Heavy Rainfall in Equatorial East Africa and Relationship with Flood Risk,"Equatorial East Africa (EEA) suffers from significant flood risks. These can be mitigated with preemptive action; however, currently available early warnings are limited to a few days' lead time. Extending warnings using subseasonal climate forecasts could open a window for more extensive preparedness activity. However, before these forecasts can be used, the basis of their skill and relevance for flood risk must be established. Here we demonstrate that subseasonal forecasts are particularly skillful over EEA. Forecasts can skillfully anticipate weekly upper-quintile rainfall within a season, at lead times of 2 weeks and beyond. We demonstrate the link between the Madden-Julian oscillation (MJO) and extreme rainfall events in the region, and confirm that leading forecast models accurately represent the EEA teleconnection to the MJO. The relevance of weekly rainfall totals for fluvial flood risk in the region is investigated using a long record of streamflow from the Nzoia River in western Kenya. Both heavy rainfall and high antecedent rainfall conditions are identified as key drivers of flood risk, with upper-quintile weekly rainfall shown to skillfully discriminate flood events. We additionally evaluate GloFAS global flood forecasts for the Nzoia basin. Though these are able to anticipate some flooding events with several weeks lead time, analysis suggests action based on these would result in a false alarm more than 50% of the time. Overall, these results build on the scientific evidence base that supports the use of subseasonal forecasts in EEA, and activities to advance their use are discussed.",https://doi.org/10.1175/JHM-D-20-0211.1,10.1175/JHM-D-20-0211.1,"MacLeod, David A.; Dankers, Rutger; Graham, Richard; Guigma, Kiswendsida; Jenkins, Luke; Todd, Martin C.; Kiptum, Augustine; Kilavi, Mary; Njogu, Andrew; Mwangi, Emmah",JOURNAL OF HYDROMETEOROLOGY,Africa; Madden-Julian oscillation; Forecast verification; skill; Flood events,MADDEN-JULIAN-OSCILLATION,,AMER METEOROLOGICAL SOC,BOSTON,"45 BEACON ST, BOSTON, MA 02108-3693 USA",1525-755X,1525-7541,,J HYDROMETEOROL,J.

437,Daily streamflow forecasting in Sobradinho Reservoir using machine learning models coupled with wavelet transform and bootstrapping,"Improving forecasting techniques for streamflow time series is of extreme importance for water resource planning. Among the available techniques, those based on machine learning models have sparked the interest of the scientific community in recent decades due to their good adaptability and forecasting accuracy, particularly when coupled with data pretreatment methods. These algorithms include artificial neural networks (ANNs) and support vector machines (SVMs). In the present study, a comparative analysis of a set of machine learning models, namely, an ANN and an SVM coupled with wavelet transform and data resampling with the bootstrap method, was performed. The analysis of these models was performed with daily streamflow time series for Sobradinho Reservoir, which is located in northeastern Brazil, corresponding to the period between 1931 and 2015. The results show that higher accuracy is achieved by the ANN than by the SVM. Furthermore, the best combination for predicting the streamflow into the Sobradinho Reservoir was the bootstrap, wavelet and neural network (BWNN) method. For a forecast 3 to 15 days ahead, this method yielded a mean square error (MSE) 15 to 25 times lower than that of the purely neural model (ANN), and the R-2 and mean absolute error (MAE) coefficients increased by more than 7 to 28% and 13 to 50%, respectively. Therefore, the BWNN is an alternative approach for future time series forecasting studies. (C) 2021 Elsevier B.V.

In this study, an improved streamflow forecasting approach using the optimal rain gauge network-based input to artificial neural network (ANN) models is proposed and demonstrated through a case study (the Middle Yarra River catchment in Victoria, Australia). First, the optimal rain gauge network is established based on the current rain gauge network in the catchment. Rainfall data from the optimal and current rain gauge networks together with streamflow observations are used as the input to train the ANN. Then, the best subset of significant input variables relating to streamflow at the catchment outlet is identified by the trained ANN. Finally, one-day-ahead streamflow forecasting is carried out using ANN models formulated based on the selected input variables for each rain gauge network. The results indicate that the optimal rain gauge networkbased input to ANN models gives the best streamflow forecasting results for the training, validation and testing phases in terms of various performance evaluation measures. Overall, the study concludes that the proposed approach is highly effective to achieve the enhanced streamflow forecasting and could be a viable option for streamflow forecasting in other catchments.",https://doi.org/10.2166/nh.2017.108,10.2166/nh.2017.108,"Adhikary, Sajal Kumar; Muttil, Nitin; Yilmaz, Abdullah Gokhan",HYDROLOGY RESEARCH,artificial neural network; input selection; optimal rain gauge network; streamflow forecasting; Yarra River catchment,YARRA RIVER CATCHMENT; AREAL RAINFALL; SPATIAL INTERPOLATION; OPTIMAL SELECTION; PART 1; RUNOFF; IMPACT; PRECIPITATION; PREDICTION; DESIGN,,IWA PUBLISHING,LONDON,"ALLIANCE HOUSE, 12 CAXTON ST, LONDON SW1H0QS, ENGLAND",0029-1277,2224-7955,,HYDROL RES,Hydrol.

439,Significant variability of structure and predictability of Arctic Ocean surface pathways affects basin-wide connectivity,"The Arctic Ocean is of central importance for the global climate and ecosystem. It is a region undergoing rapid climate change, with a dramatic decrease in sea ice cover over recent decades. Surface advective pathways connect the transport of nutrients, freshwater, carbon and contaminants with their sources and sinks. Pathways of drifting material are deformed under velocity strain, due to atmosphere-ocean-ice coupling. Deformation is largest at fine space- and time-scales and is associated with a loss of potential predictability, analogous to weather often becoming unpredictable as synoptic-scale eddies interact and deform. However, neither satellite observations nor climate model projections resolve fine-scale ocean velocity structure. Here, we use a high-resolution ocean model hindcast and coarser satellite-derived ice velocities, to show: that ensemble-mean pathways within the Transpolar Drift during 2004-14 have large interannual variability and that both saddle-like flow structures and the presence of fine-scale velocity gradients are important for basin-wide connectivity and crossing time, pathway bifurcation, predictability and dispersion. The Transpolar Drift, which governs the transport of freshwater, nutrients, carbon and contaminants across the Arctic Ocean, varies interannually, and is affected by fine-scale flow structures and processes, according to high-resolution simulations and satellite data.",https://doi.org/10.1038/s43247-021-00237-0,10.1038/s43247-021-00237-0,"Wilson, Chris; Aksenov, Yevgeny; Rynders, Stefanie; Kelly, Stephen J.; Krumpen, Thomas; Coward, Andrew C.",COMMUNICATIONS EARTH & ENVIRONMENT,,GULF-STREAM TRANSPORT; SEA-ICE MODEL; MEAN FLOW; CIRCULATION; DRIFT; TEMPERATURE; SENSITIVITY; TRENDS,,SPRINGERNATURE,LONDON,"CAMPUS, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON, N1 9XW, ENGLAND",,2662-4435,,COMMUN EARTH ENVIRON,Commun.

440,Assessment of neuro-fuzzy approach based different wavelet families for daily flow rates forecasting,"Heavy rainfall over a short period or slowly during long periods can significantly increase the amount of water. Where it results in floods that can pose a direct threat, capable of causing human and material losses. Over the past two decades, artificial intelligence has been widely applied in the field of hydrology as well as in many other areas of hydraulic engineering. The wavelet transform is a very popular technique in the analysis of non-stationary time series and particularly effective for hydrological series. Currently, the application of intelligent hybrid systems in different fields has shown good performance and unparalleled efficiency. As such, in this work, we propose a hybrid neuro-fuzzy-wavelet model to modelling the rainfall-runoff transformation for forecasting daily flow rates in the Sebaou basin located in Tizi Ouzou region. The results obtained are very encouraging and better than those obtained by the models used for comparison in this research. According to the results, the hybrid neuro-fuzzy-wavelet model with mother wavelet db7 gave us better performance for daily flow rates forecasting.",https://doi.org/10.1007/s40808-020-00855-1,10.1007/s40808-020-00855-1,"Abda, Zaki; Chettih, Mohamed; Zerouali, Bilel",MODELING EARTH SYSTEMS AND ENVIRONMENT,Forecasting; Flow rates; Neuro-fuzzy approach; Discrete wavelet transform; Wavelet families,INFERENCE SYSTEM; MODEL; NETWORKS; ANFIS; DECOMPOSITION; TRANSFORMS; RIVER,,SPRINGER HEIDELBERG,HEIDELBERG,"TIERGARTENSTRASSE 17, D-69121 HEIDELBERG, GERMANY",2363-6203,2363-6211,,MODEL EARTH SYST ENV,Model.

441,Developing a global operational seasonal hydro-meteorological forecasting system: G1oFAS-Seasonal v1.0,"Global overviews of upcoming flood and drought events are key for many applications, including disaster risk reduction initiatives. Seasonal forecasts are designed to provide early indications of such events weeks or even months in advance, but seasonal forecasts for hydrological variables at large or global scales are few and far between. Here, we present the first operational global-scale seasonal hydrometeorological forecasting system: G1oFAS-Seasonal. Developed as an extension of the Global Flood Awareness System (G1oFAS), G1oFAS-Seasonal couples seasonal meteorological forecasts from ECMWF with a hydrological model to provide openly available probabilistic forecasts of river flow out to 4 months ahead for the global river network. This system has potential benefits not only for disaster risk reduction through early awareness of floods and droughts, but also for water-related sectors such as agriculture and water resources management, in particular for regions where no other forecasting system exists. We describe the key hydrometeorological components and computational framework of G1oFAS-Seasonal, alongside the forecast products available, before discussing initial evaluation results and next steps.",https://doi.org/10.5194/gmd-11-3327-2018,10.5194/gmd-11-3327-2018,"Emerton, Rebecca; Zsoter, Ervin; Arnal, Louise; Cloke, Hannah L.; Muraro, Davide; Prudhomme, Christel; Stephens, Elisabeth M.; Salamon, Peter; Pappenberger, Florian",GEOSCIENTIFIC MODEL DEVELOPMENT,,NINO-SOUTHERN-OSCILLATION; STREAMFLOW FORECASTS; UNITED-STATES; PREDICTION; MODEL; SCALE; EUROPE; ERROR; ENSO,,COPERNICUS GESELLSCHAFT MBH,GOTTINGEN,"BAHNHOFSALLEE 1E, GOTTINGEN, 37081, GERMANY",1991-959X,1991-9603,,GEOSCI MODEL DEV,Geosci.

442,Flood and Inundation Forecasting in the Sparsely Gauged Transboundary Chenab River Basin Using Satellite Rain and Coupling Meteorological and Hydrological Models,"Flood forecasting in a transboundary river basin is challenging due to insufficient data sharing between countries in the upper and lower reaches of a basin. A solution is the use of satellite-observed rainfall and numerical weather prediction (NWP) for hydrological forecasting. We applied this method to the transboundary sparsely gauged Chenab River basin in Pakistan and India to reproduce the exceptionally high flood in 2014. We employed global NWPs by three weather centers to consider forecast uncertainty and downscaled them using the Weather Research and Forecasting (WRF) Model to prepare precipitation inputs. For hydrological simulations, we used a kinematic wave model, the Integrated Flood Analysis System (IFAS), for the upper-reach basin with high mountains and steep slopes, and we used a diffusive-wave rainfall-runoff-inundation (RRI) model for low altitudes and mild slopes. In our forecasting experiment, the precipitation by the global NWP was not able to predict flood peaks consistently. However, the downscaled rainfall by regional NWP showed good performance in predicting flood waves quantitatively, and a multimodel approach provided added value in issuing reliable warning as early as 6 days in advance. A confident streamflow forecasting near the border of the countries also led to reliable inundation forecasting by the RRI model in the lower-reach basin.",https://doi.org/10.1175/JHM-D-18-0226.1,10.1175/JHM-D-18-0226.1,"Asghar, Malik Rizwan; Ushiyama, Tomoki; Riaz, Muhammad; Miyamoto, Mamoru",JOURNAL OF HYDROMETEOROLOGY,Probabilistic Quantitative Precipitation Forecasting (PQPF); Flood events,2010 PAKISTAN FLOOD; NWP RAINFALL; SYSTEM; VERIFICATION,,AMER METEOROLOGICAL SOC,BOSTON,"45 BEACON ST, BOSTON, MA 02108-3693 USA",1525-755X,1525-7541,,J HYDROMETEOROL,J.

443,A GIS Based Hydrological Model for River Water Level Detection & Flood Prediction featuring morphological operations.,"Mostly river water level and flood forecasting methods are based on gauging stations measurements at discrete locations, which limits their capability to provide accurate and timely data over large extent, also limited or no data available on remote locations. So here we present an idea to use high resolution satellite images for real time mapping of river water level. In this project, we developed a Web based GIS system for mapping river water level, early warning and mapping for flood disasters. To improve flood forecasting/ warning, we developed a decision support system (DSS) for flood monitoring and prediction that integrates GIS, satellite image processing and hydrological modelling. We present the methodology for data integration, floodplain delineation, and online map interfaces. Our Web based GIS system can dynamically display observed and predicted water levels for decision makers and the general public. The users can access a Web-based GIS system which models current flood events and displays satellite imagery and 3D visualization integrated with the flood plain area. The output from the hydrological modeling will be used for flooding prediction for the next 1 day to 2 days (24 and 48 hours) along the lower Indus River. In this stage river water level analysis has been achieved, work on the hydrological modelling is in progress to acquire river water stage & flood level and the prediction.",https://doi.org/,,"Zafar, Sarmad; Azhar, H.

444,What Are the Key Drivers Controlling the Quality of Seasonal Streamflow Forecasts?,"Recent technological advances in representation of processes in numerical climate models have led to skillful predictions, which can consequently increase the confidence of hydrological predictions and usability of hydroclimatic services. Given that many water-related stakeholders are affected by seasonal hydrological variations, there is a need to manage such variations to their advantage through better understanding of the drivers that influence hydrological predictability. Here we analyze the seasonal forecasts of streamflow volumes across about 35,400 basins in Europe, which lie along a strong gradient in terms of climatology, scale, and hydrological regime. We then link the seasonal volumetric errors to various physiographic-hydroclimatic descriptors and meteorological biases in order to identify the key drivers controlling predictability. Streamflow volumes over Europe are well predicted, yet with some geographic and seasonal variability; however, the predictability deteriorates with increasing lead time particularly in the winter months. Nevertheless, we show that the forecast quality is well correlated to a set of descriptors, which vary depending on the initialization month. The forecast quality of seasonal streamflow volumes is strongly dependent on the basin's hydrological regime, with limited predictability in relatively flashy basins. On the contrary, snow and/or baseflow dominated regions with long recessions show high streamflow predictability. Finally, climatology and precipitation forecast biases are also related to streamflow predictability, highlighting the importance of developing robust bias adjustment methods. Overall, this investigation shows that the seasonal streamflow predictability can be clustered, and hence regionalized, based on a priori knowledge of local hydroclimatic conditions. Plain Language Summary Hydrological information for the months ahead is of great value to existing decision-making practices, particularly to those affected by the vagaries of the climate and who would benefit from better understanding and managing climate-related risks. Currently, there is limited knowledge of the factors controlling the quality of the seasonal streamflow forecasts. We analyze such forecasts over Europe and link their predictability to basin descriptors and meteorological biases. This allows the identification of the key drivers along a strong hydroclimatic gradient. The seasonal streamflow predictability varies geographically and seasonally with acceptable values for the first lead months. Predictability deteriorates with increasing lead time particularly in the winter months. The hydrological regime is strongly linked to the forecast quality, with quickly reacting basins showing low values. Basin climatology and precipitation forecast biases are also related to the predictability of streamflow.",https://doi.org/10.1029/2019WR026987,10.1029/2019WR026987,"Pechlivanidis, I.

445,Verification of ECMWF System 4 for seasonal hydrological forecasting in a northern climate,"Hydropower production requires optimal dam and reservoir management to prevent flooding damage and avoid operation losses. In a northern climate, where spring freshet constitutes the main inflow volume, seasonal forecasts can help to establish a yearly strategy. Long-term hydrological forecasts often rely on past observations of streamflow or meteorological data. Another alternative is to use ensemble meteorological forecasts produced by climate models. In this paper, those produced by the ECMWF (European Centre for Medium-Range Forecast) System 4 are examined and bias is characterized. Bias correction, through the linear scaling method, improves the performance of the raw ensemble meteorological forecasts in terms of continuous ranked probability score (CRPS). Then, three seasonal ensemble hydrological forecasting systems are compared: (1) the climatology of simulated streamflow, (2) the ensemble hydrological forecasts based on climatology (ESP) and (3) the hydrological forecasts based on bias-corrected ensemble meteorological forecasts from System 4 (corr-DSP). Simulated streamflow computed using observed meteorological data is used as benchmark. Accounting for initial conditions is valuable even for long-term forecasts. ESP and corr-DSP both outperform the climatology of simulated streamflow for lead times from 1 to 5 months depending on the season and watershed. Integrating information about future meteorological conditions also improves monthly volume forecasts. For the 1-month lead time, a gain exists for almost all watersheds during winter, summer and fall. However, volume forecasts performance for spring varies from one watershed to another. For most of them, the performance is close to the performance of ESP. For longer lead times, the CRPS skill score is mostly in favour of ESP, even if for many watersheds, ESP and corr-DSP have comparable skill. Corr-DSP appears quite reliable but, in some cases, under-dispersion or bias is observed. A more complex bias-correction method should be further investigated to remedy this weakness and take more advantage of the ensemble forecasts produced by the climate model. Overall, in this study, bias-corrected ensemble meteorological forecasts appear to be an interesting source of information for hydrological forecasting for lead times up to 1 month. They could also complement ESP for longer lead times.",https://doi.org/10.5194/hess-21-5747-2017,10.5194/hess-21-5747-2017,"Bazile, Rachel; Boucher, Marie-Amelie; Perreault, Luc; Leconte, Robert",HYDROLOGY AND EARTH SYSTEM SCIENCES,,SCORING RULES; PREDICTION; PRECIPITATION; BASIN,,COPERNICUS GESELLSCHAFT MBH,GOTTINGEN,"BAHNHOFSALLEE 1E, GOTTINGEN, 37081, GERMANY",1027-5606,1607-7938,,HYDROL EARTH SYST SC,Hydrol.

446,Particle Swarm Optimization Based Artificial Neural Network Model for Forecasting Groundwater Level in UDUPI District,"The decline in groundwater is a global problem due to increase in population, industries, and enviromnental aspects such as increase in temperature, decrease in overall rainfall, loss of forests etc. In Udupi district, India, the water source fully depends on the River Swarna for drinking and agriculture purposes. Since the water storage in Bajae dam is declining day-by-day and the people of Udupi district are under immense pressure due to scarcity of drinking water, alternatively depend on ground water. As the groundwater is being heavily used for drinking and agricultural purposes, there is a decline in its water table. Therefore, the groundwater resources must be identified and preserved for human survival. This research proposes a data driven approach for forecasting the groundwater level. The monthly variations in groundwater level and rainfall data in three observation wells located in Brahmavar, Kundapur and Plebri were investigated and the scenarios were examined for 2000-2013. The focus of this research work is to develop an ANN based groundwater level forecasting model and compare with hybrid ANN-PSO forecasting model. The model parameters are tested using different combinations of the data. The results reveal that PSO-ANN based hybrid model gives a better prediction accuracy, than ANN alone.",https://doi.org/10.1063/1.5031983,10.1063/1.5031983,"Balavalikar, Supreetha; Nayak, Prabhakar; Shenoy, Narayan; Nayak, Krishnamurthy","INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE ON ELECTRICAL, ELECTRONICS, MATERIALS AND APPLIED SCIENCE",,,,AMER INST PHYSICS,MELVILLE,"2 HUNTINGTON QUADRANGLE, STE 1NO1, MELVILLE, NY 11747-4501 USA",0094-243X,,978-0-7354-1647-5,AIP CONF PROC,,,2018,1952,,,,20021,
447,Elaborate simulations and forecasting of the effects of urbanization on karst flood events using the improved Karst-Liuxihe model,"Urbanization, especially land use pattern changes, has a great impact on natural flood events in a karst basin. Quantitative simulations of the effects of urbanization on karst flood events and forecasts of future evolution trends are difficult based on the current hydrological models. These models often require a large amount of data when used in karst areas due to the complex model structure and model parameters. To overcome the limitations of model applications, a physically based and fully distributed karst hydrological model, i.e., the improved Karst-Liuxihe (IKL) model, was proposed in this study to simulate and forecast karst flood events under the influence of urbanization. This IKL model was developed through the overall improvement of the Karst-Liuxihe (KL) model. The main additions were the improved runoff generation algorithm and the underground river confluence module. The karst flood simulation results of the IKL model were much better than those of the KL model: the average values of the Nash-Sutcliffe coefficient, correlation coefficient, and coefficient of the water balance increased by 23%, 23% and 26%, respectively, while the process relative error, flood peak flow relative error, and flood peak flow time error decreased by 21%, 22%, and 3 h, respectively, which confirmed that the improvements to the model were effective and feasible. Therefore, this paper used the IKL model to simulate karst flood events and annual runoff under the influence of urbanization based on 4 extreme land use scenarios. In addition, the model effectively forecasted the future runoff in 2030, 2040, and 2050. The results indicated that the critical proportion of urbanized area throughout the watershed area was 45%. When the urban proportion exceeded 45%, waterlogging could occur in the study area.",https://doi.org/10.1016/j.catena.2020.104990,10.1016/j.catena.2020.104990,"Li, Ji; Hong, Aihua; Yuan, Daoxian; Jiang, Yongjun; Zhang, Yuanzhu; Deng, Shujin; Cao, Cong; Liu, Jiao; Chen, Yangbo",CATENA,Simulations and forecasting; Urbanization; Karst flood events; Improved Karst-Liuxihe (IKL) model,,,ELSEVIER,AMSTERDAM,"RADARWEG 29, 1043 NX AMSTERDAM, NETHERLANDS",0341-8162,1872-6887,,CATENA,Catena,FEB,2021,197,,,,104990,
448,Daily River Flow Forecasting with Hybrid Support Vector Machine - Particle Swarm Optimization,"The application of artificial intelligence techniques for river flow forecasting can further improve the management of water resources and flood prevention. This study concerns the development of support vector machine (SVM) based model and its hybridization with particle swarm optimization (PSO) to forecast short term daily river flow at Upper Bertam Catchment located in Cameron Highland, Malaysia. Ten years duration of historical rainfall, antecedent river flow data and various meteorology parameters data from 2003 to 2012 are used in this study. Four SVM based models are proposed which are SVM1, SVM2, SVM-PSO1 and SVM-PSO2 to forecast 1 to 7 day ahead of river flow. SVM1 and SVM-PSO1 are the models with historical rainfall and antecedent river flow as its input, while SVM2 and SVM-PSO2 are the models with historical rainfall, antecedent river flow data and additional meteorological parameters as input. The performances of the proposed model are measured in term of RMSE and R-2. It is found that, SVM2 outperformed SVM1 and SVM-PSO2 outperformed SVM-PSO1 which meant the additional meteorology parameters used as input to the proposed models significantly affect the model performances. Hybrid models SVM-PSO1 and SVM-PSO2 yield higher performances as compared to SVM1 and SVM2. It is found that hybrid models are more effective in forecasting river flow at 1 to 7 day ahead at the study area.",https://doi.org/10.1088/1755-1315/140/1/012035,10.1088/1755-1315/140/1/012035,"Zaini, N.; Malek, M.

449,Evaluation of an Integrated Seasonal Forecast System for Agricultural Water Management in Mediterranean Regions,"The Euro-Mediterranean Center on Climate Change (CMCC) seasonal forecasting system, based on the global coupled model CMCC-CM, performs seasonal forecasts every month, producing several ensemble integrations conducted for the following 6 months. In this study, a performance evaluation of the skills of this system is performed in two neighbouring Mediterranean medium-small size catchments located in Southern Italy, the Crati river and the Coscile river, whose hydrological cycles are particularly important for agricultural purposes. Initially, the performance of the system is evaluated comparing observed and simulated precipitation and temperature anomalies in the irrigation periods of the years 2011-2017. Forecasts issued on April 1st (i.e., at the beginning of the irrigation period) are evaluated, considering two lead times (first and second trimester). Afterward, the seasonal forecasts are integrated into a complete meteo-hydrological system. Precipitation and temperature provided by the global model are ingested in the spatially distributed and physically based In-STRHyM (Intermediate Space-Time Resolution Hydrological Model) model, which analyzes the hydrological impact of the seasonal forecasts. Though the predicted precipitation and temperature anomalies are not highly correlated with observations, the integrated seasonal forecast for the hydrological variables provides significant correlations between observed and predicted anomalies, especially concerning mean discharge (>0.65). Overall, the system showed to provide useful insights for agricultural water management in the study area.",https://doi.org/10.1007/978-3-030-39081-5_51,10.1007/978-3-030-39081-5_51,"Senatore, Alfonso; Fuoco, Domenico; Sanna, Antonella; Borrelli, Andrea; Mendicino, Giuseppe; Gualdi, Silvio","NUMERICAL COMPUTATIONS: THEORY AND ALGORITHMS, PT I",Meteo-hydrological system; Seasonal forecast; Agricultural water management,PREDICTION,,SPRINGER INTERNATIONAL PUBLISHING AG,CHAM,"GEWERBESTRASSE 11, CHAM, CH-6330, SWITZERLAND",0302-9743,1611-3349,978-3-030-39081-5,LECT NOTES COMPUT SC,,,2020,11973,,596,603,,
450,What is the most useful approach for forecasting hydrological extremes during El Nino?,"In the past, efforts to prepare for the impacts of El Nino-driven flood and drought hazards have often relied on seasonal precipitation forecasts as a proxy for hydrological extremes, due to a lack of hydrologically relevant information. However, precipitation forecasts are not the best indicator of hydrological extremes. Now, two different global scale hydro-meteorological approaches for predicting river flow extremes are available to support flood and drought preparedness. These approaches are statistical forecasts based on large-scale climate variability and teleconnections, and resource-intensive dynamical forecasts using coupled ocean-atmosphere general circulation models. Both have the potential to provide early warning information, and both are used to prepare for El Nino impacts, but which approach provides the most useful forecasts? This study uses river flow observations to assess and compare the ability of two recently-developed forecasts to predict high and low river flow during El Nino: statistical historical probabilities of ENSO-driven hydrological extremes, and the dynamical seasonal river flow outlook of the Global Flood Awareness System (GloFAS-seasonal). Our findings highlight regions of the globe where each forecast is (or is not) skilful compared to a forecast of climatology, and the advantages and disadvantages of each forecasting approach. We conclude that in regions where extreme river flow is predominantly driven by El Nino, or in regions where GloFAS-seasonal currently lacks skill, the historical probabilities generally provide a more useful forecast. In areas where other teleconnections also impact river flow, with the effect of strengthening, mitigating or even reversing the influence of El Nino, GloFAS-seasonal forecasts are typically more useful.",https://doi.org/10.1088/2515-7620/ab114e,10.1088/2515-7620/ab114e,"Emerton, Rebecca E.; Stephens, Elisabeth M.; Cloke, Hannah L.",ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH COMMUNICATIONS,hydrological extremes; El Nino; seasonal forecasting; climate variability,INDIAN-OCEAN DIPOLE; SOUTHERN-OSCILLATION; SPRING PREDICTABILITY; ENSO; STREAMFLOW; EVENTS; PREDICTIONS; BARRIER; GLOFAS; STATE,,IOP PUBLISHING LTD,BRISTOL,"TEMPLE CIRCUS, TEMPLE WAY, BRISTOL BS1 6BE, ENGLAND",2515-7620,,,ENVIRON RES COMMUN,Environ.

451,A Hybrid Model for Real-Time Probabilistic Flood Forecasting Using Elman Neural Network with Heterogeneity of Error Distributions,"Traditional static neural networks often fail to describe dynamic flood processes, while recurrent neural networks can reflect this dynamic feature of flooding. In this paper, a real-time framework for probabilistic flood forecasting using an Elman neural network is presented. Based on this framework, flood forecasting models with different lead times are developed and trained by a real-time recurrent learning algorithm for forecasting the inflow of the Xianghongdian reservoir of the Huai River in East China. The performances of these models are evaluated. The forecasting model having a 3 h lead time meets the precision requirements and is chosen as the deterministic flood forecasting model. Compared with the multilayer perceptron having a 3 h lead time, the relative error of flood volume is 5.28% less, and the coefficient of efficiency is 0.105 greater. We further analyze the error characteristics of the selected model and derive the discharge probability density function based on the heterogeneity of error distributions. The forecasted discharge intervals with different confidence levels, the expected values, and the median values are obtained. The results show that the average relative errors of flood volume and peak discharge obtained by the median value forecasting are -1.66% and 5.69% respectively, and the coefficient of efficiency is 0.784. The performance of the median value forecasting was slightly better than that of the deterministic forecasting, and considerably better than that of the expected value forecasting. This study demonstrates that the proposed model has high practicability and can provide decision support for flood control.",https://doi.org/10.1007/s11269-019-02351-3,10.1007/s11269-019-02351-3,"Wan, Xinyu; Yang, Qingyan; Jiang, Peng; Zhong, Ping'an",WATER RESOURCES MANAGEMENT,Recurrent neural network; Real-time recurrent learning; Heterogeneity of error distributions; Probability density function; Flood forecasting,HYDROLOGICAL MODEL; UNCERTAINTY ANALYSIS; RAINFALL; CALIBRATION; RUNOFF; SIMULATION; SATELLITE; SYSTEM; RIVER; SCALE,,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0920-4741,1573-1650,,WATER RESOUR MANAG,Water Resour.

452,Adaptive forecasting of phytoplankton communities,"The global proliferation of harmful algal blooms poses an increasing threat to water resources, recreation and ecosystems. Predicting the occurrence of these blooms is therefore needed to assist water managers in making management decisions to mitigate their impact. Evaluation of the potential for forecasting of algal blooms using the phytoplankton community model PROTECH was undertaken in pseudo-real-time. This was achieved within a data assimilation scheme using the Ensemble Kalman Filter to allow uncertainties and model nonlinearities to be propagated to forecast outputs. Tests were made on two mesotrophic lakes in the English Lake District, which differ in depth and nutrient regime. Some forecasting success was shown for chlorophyll a, but not all forecasts were able to perform better than a persistence forecast. There was a general reduction in forecast skill with increasing forecasting period but forecasts for up to four or five days showed noticeably greater promise than those for longer periods. Associated forecasts of phytoplankton community structure were broadly consistent with observations but their translation to cyanobacteria forecasts was challenging owing to the interchangeability of simulated functional species.

453,Providing peak river flow statistics and forecasting in the Niger River basin,"Flooding is a growing concern in West Africa. Improved quantification of discharge extremes and associated uncertainties is needed to improve infrastructure design, and operational forecasting is needed to provide timely warnings. In this study, we use discharge observations, a hydrological model (Niger-HYPE) and extreme value analysis to estimate peak river flow statistics (e.g. the discharge magnitude with a 100-year return period) across the Niger River basin. To test the model's capacity of predicting peak flows, we compared 30-year maximum discharge and peak flow statistics derived from the model vs. derived from nine observation stations. The results indicate that the model simulates peak discharge reasonably well (on average + 20%). However, the peak flow statistics have a large uncertainty range, which ought to be considered in infrastructure design. We then applied the methodology to derive basin-wide maps of peak flow statistics and their associated uncertainty. The results indicate that the method is applicable across the hydrologically active part of the river basin, and that the uncertainty varies substantially depending on location. Subsequently, we used the most recent bias-corrected climate projections to analyze potential changes in peak flow statistics in a changed climate. The results are generally ambiguous, with consistent changes only in very few areas. To test the forecasting capacity, we ran Niger-HYPE with a combination of meteorological data sets for the 2008 high-flow season and compared with observations. The results indicate reasonable forecasting capacity (on average 17% deviation), but additional years should also be evaluated. We finish by presenting a strategy and pilot project which will develop an operational flood monitoring and forecasting system based in-situ data, earth observations, modelling, and extreme statistics. In this way we aim to build capacity to ultimately improve resilience toward floods, protecting lives and infrastructure in the region. (C) 2017 The Authors.

454,Hindcasting Ecosystem Functioning Change in an Anthropogenized Estuary: Implications for an Era of Global Change,"Understanding how altered hydrodynamics related to climate change and anthropogenic modifications affect ecosystem integrity of shallow coastal soft-sediment environments requires a sound integration of how species populations influence ecosystem functioning across heterogeneous spatial scales. Here, we hindcasted how intertidal habitat loss and altered hydrodynamic regimes between 1955 and 2010 associated with geomorphological change to accommodate expansion in anthropogenic activities in the Western Scheldt altered spatial patterns and basin-wide estimates of ecosystem functioning. To this end we combined an empirically derived metabolic model for the effect of the common ragworm Hediste diversicolor on sediment biogeochemistry (measured as sediment oxygen uptake) with a hydrodynamic and population biomass distribution model. Our integrative modeling approach predicted an overall decrease by 304 tons in ragworm biomass between 1955 and 2010, accounting for a reduction by 28% in stimulated sediment oxygen uptake at the landscape scale. Local gains or losses in habitat suitability and ecosystem functioning were primarily driven by changes in maximal current velocities and inundation regimes resulting from deepening, dredging and disposal practices.

455,An Analytical Risk Analysis Method for Reservoir Flood Control Operation Considering Forecast Information,"Risk analysis is vital for reservoir flood control operation considering forecast because forecast uncertainties may create risks of multiple hazard events, including the single-hazard events, the union and intersection of single-hazard events (UHE and IHE). The probability of UHE and IHE are the major concern of decision-makers. This research proposes an analytical flood risk probability calculation framework for single-hazard event, UHE and IHE caused by uncertainties in flood forecasting and takes Dahuofang Reservoir, located in the Hunhe River basin, Northeast China, as a case study. In the framework, the risk is calculated by the integral of the joint probability density function (Pdf) of the risk sources over the hazard domain, which is the collection of the values of risk sources that cause hazards. The determination method of the hazard domain and the Pdf of risk sources and the procedure of risk analysis are elaborated. Results of single-hazard events show that the proposed methodology is of higher precision compared with the risk analysis method based on the law of total probability. Meanwhile, the flood risks of UHE and IHE are calculated for the reservoir operation under different levels of flood limit water level. The study provides a new method of flood risk analysis for flood control reservoir operation.",https://doi.org/10.1007/s11269-021-02795-6,10.1007/s11269-021-02795-6,"Ning, Yawei; Ding, Wei; Liang, Guohua; He, Bin; Zhou, Huicheng",WATER RESOURCES MANAGEMENT,Risk analysis; Reservoir operation; Integral thought; Hazard domain; Union and intersection of single-hazard events,CLIMATE-CHANGE; DYNAMIC CONTROL; DERIVATION; SYSTEM,,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0920-4741,1573-1650,,WATER RESOUR MANAG,Water Resour.

456,Can assimilation of crowdsourced data in hydrological modelling improve flood prediction?,"Monitoring stations have been used for decades to properly measure hydrological variables and better predict floods. To this end, methods to incorporate these observations into mathematical water models have also been developed. Besides, in recent years, the continued technological advances, in combination with the growing inclusion of citizens in participatory processes related to water resources management, have encouraged the increase of citizen science projects around the globe. In turn, this has stimulated the spread of low-cost sensors to allow citizens to participate in the collection of hydrological data in a more distributed way than the classic static physical sensors do. However, two main disadvantages of such crowdsourced data are the irregular availability and variable accuracy from sensor to sensor, which makes them challenging to use in hydrological modelling. This study aims to demonstrate that streamflow data, derived from crowdsourced water level observations, can improve flood prediction if integrated in hydrological models. Two different hydrological models, applied to four case studies, are considered. Realistic (albeit synthetic) time series are used to represent crowdsourced data in all case studies. In this study, it is found that the data accuracies have much more influence on the model results than the irregular frequencies of data availability at which the streamflow data are assimilated. This study demonstrates that data collected by citizens, characterized by being asynchronous and inaccurate, can still complement traditional networks formed by few accurate, static sensors and improve the accuracy of flood forecasts.",https://doi.org/10.5194/hess-21-839-2017,10.5194/hess-21-839-2017,"Mazzoleni, Maurizio; Verlaan, Martin; Alfonso, Leonardo; Monego, Martina; Norbiato, Daniele; Ferri, Miche; Solomatine, Dimitri P.",HYDROLOGY AND EARTH SYSTEM SCIENCES,,STREAMFLOW OBSERVATIONS; SIMULATION EXPERIMENTS; KALMAN FILTER; SOIL-MOISTURE; INITIALIZATION; INFORMATION; VALIDATION; NETWORK; QUALITY,,COPERNICUS GESELLSCHAFT MBH,GOTTINGEN,"BAHNHOFSALLEE 1E, GOTTINGEN, 37081, GERMANY",1027-5606,1607-7938,,HYDROL EARTH SYST SC,Hydrol.

457,An error model for long-range ensemble forecasts of ephemeral rivers,"Few ensemble streamflow forecasting systems are designed to operate for ephemeral rivers. In this study, we revise our error model for generating Forecast Guided Stochastic Scenarios (FoGSS) to produce statistically re-liable long-range (12-month) forecasts for ephemeral rivers. FoGSS features an error model with four stages: data transformation, bias-correction, an autoregressive error model and the statistical distribution of residuals. We revise the fourth stage of FoGSS with a parameter estimation method that uses data censoring to account for zero values in both observations and forecasts. This allows FoGSS to produce statistically reliable ensemble forecasts in even highly ephemeral streams (with > 50% zero flows). We apply FoGSS to conventional ensemble hydrological prediction (ESP) forecasts for 50 Australian catchments, including 26 ephemeral rivers. We show that FoGSS improves the accuracy of ESP forecasts at short lead times, while at long lead times FoGSS forecasts transition to climatology-like forecasts. FoGSS forecasts are reliable in ensemble spread at individual lead times and for volumes aggregated over lead times, even in highly ephemeral rivers. FoGSS forecasts pave the way for operational long-range forecasts in ephemeral rivers, meeting a key need for improved water management.",https://doi.org/10.1016/j.advwatres.2021.103891,10.1016/j.advwatres.2021.103891,"Bennett, James C.; Wang, Q.

458,"A multivariate streamflow forecasting model by integrating improved complete ensemble empirical mode decomposition with additive noise, sample entropy, Gini index and sequence-to-sequence approaches","Accurate and reliable streamflow forecasting is indispensable to deal with the dynamics of streamflow parameters and for optimal use of water resources, flood, and drought control. In this study, a hybrid-forecasting model integrating improved complete ensemble empirical mode decomposition with additive noise (ICEEMDAN)Sample Entropy (SE)-Gini Index (GI)-Sequence to Sequence (Seq2Seq) for streamflow forecasting, namely ISGS (ICEEMDAN-SE-GI-Seq2Seq), is proposed. Firstly, ICEEMDAN is employed to decompose the streamflow time series into subcomponents that are further combined based on SE values. Afterward, GI is used to select the most appropriate features to decrease the computational burden and ameliorate the model's performance. Finally, Seq2Seq architecture based on the long short-term memory (LSTM) algorithm is utilized for predicting the multivariate hydro-meteorological data at three stations located in Turkey. Besides ISGS, the ICEEMDAN-SESeq2Seq, DWT-GI-Seq2Seq, DWT-Seq2Seq, and standalone Seq2Seq models are also constructed as counterpart comparison models. The simulation under different scenarios, several statistical metrics, and judicious plots; substantiate ISGS validity for streamflow forecasting. The correlation coefficient, Nash-Sutcliffe coefficient of efficiency, and Willmott's index values presented by the ISGS model are 0.974, 0.949, and 0.987 for Kirkgoze station, 0.928, 0.839, and 0.947 Kosk station, 0.888, 0.769, and 0.931 for Karagobek station.

459,An improved long short-term memory network for streamflow forecasting in the upper Yangtze River,"Characterized by essential complexity, dynamism, and dynamics, streamflow forecasting presents a great challenge to hydrologists. Long short-term memory (LSTM) streamflow forecast model has received a lot of attention in recent years due to its powerful non-linear modeling ability. But probabilistic streamflow forecasting has rarely been addressed by the LSTM approach. In this study, a probabilistic Long Short-Term Memory network coupled with the Gaussian process (GP) is proposed to deal with the probabilistic daily streamflow forecasting. Moreover, considering that changing mean and variance over time exist in the daily streamflow time series, the heteroscedastic Gaussian process regression is adopted to produce a varying prediction interval. The proposed method encapsulates the inductive biases of the LSTM recurrent network and retains the non-parametric, probabilistic property of Gaussian processes. The performance of the proposed model is investigated by predicting the daily streamflow time series collected from the upper Yangtze River and its tributaries. Artificial neuron network, generalized linear model, heteroscedastic GP, and regular LSTM models are also developed for comparison. Results indicated that the performance of the proposed model is satisfying. It improves prediction accuracy as well as provides an adaptive prediction interval, which is of great significance for water resources management and planning.",https://doi.org/10.1007/s00477-020-01766-4,10.1007/s00477-020-01766-4,"Zhu, Shuang; Luo, Xiangang; Yuan, Xiaohui; Xu, Zhanya",STOCHASTIC ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH AND RISK ASSESSMENT,Streamflow forecasting; LSTM; Heteroscedastic Gaussian process regression; Prediction interval,MODEL; MULTISTEP; ERROR,,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"ONE NEW YORK PLAZA, SUITE 4600, NEW YORK, NY, UNITED STATES",1436-3240,1436-3259,,STOCH ENV RES RISK A,Stoch.

This new tool, the Streamflow Prediction Tool (SPT), takes 15-day European Center for Medium Range Weather Forecasts (ECMWF) runoff forecasts and calculates streamflow using the routing application for parallel computation of discharge (RAPID) hydrologic routing model. The SPT streamflow product is useful in calculating initial inundation at large spatial scales using the AutoRoute flood extent model. The SPT can also provide boundary conditions for nested hydrologic models, e.g., higher-fidelity models in specific areas of interest. This presentation provides an overview of how ERDC researchers link SPT outputs to the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers Hydrologic Engineering Center River Analysis System (HEC-RAS) Version 5. The linkage allows ERDC to perform high fidelity, two-dimensional hydraulic forecasting at nearly any location in the world. The linkage relies upon the availability of high-resolution, global digital elevation models (DEMs). Bathymetry is estimated using general concepts related to hydraulic geometry.

461,A new intelligent method for monthly streamflow prediction: hybrid wavelet support vector regression based on grey wolf optimizer (WSVR-GWO),"Forecasting daily and monthly streamflows is necessary for short- and long-term water resources management, particularly in extreme cases, e.g., flood and drought. Accurate models are needed to plan and manage water resources in watersheds. Recently, support vector regression (SVR) shows the ability to handle the hydrological forecasting issues, but the accuracy of SVR depends on the appropriate choice of parameters and selection of proper inputs. A new meta-heuristic algorithm called grey wolf optimizer (GWO) is used in the current research in order to improve SVR accuracy in forecasting monthly streamflow. The proposed approach is compared with other evolutionary methods, particle swarm optimization, shuffled complex evolution, and multi-verse optimization, that are employed in tuning SVR parameters. Furthermore, the proposed methods were also combined with wavelet transform and tested using monthly streamflow data from two gauging stations, Ain Bedra and Fermatou, in Algeria. To assess the performance of the developed models, Nash-Sutcliffe efficiency (NSE), correlation coefficient, root mean squared error (RMSE), and mean absolute error (MAE) were used. The obtained results indicate that multi-linear regression provides appropriate input variables to SVR models. According to all of the performance measures used, hybrid models exhibit better performances, in monthly streamflow prediction, compared with single versions. For example, for the Ain Bedra station, the NSEcriterion and the correlation coefficient values increased considerably from 27.36% and 0.5405, for the single models, to 95.72% and 0.9786, for the hybrid models. A great decrease has also been obtained for the RMSE and MAE values, which decreased from 0.1562 m(3)/s and 0.1244 m(3)/s to 0.6433m(3)/s and 0.3047 m(3)/s. In addition, the new GWO algorithm outperformed the other algorithms in terms of both forecasting accuracy and convergence.",https://doi.org/10.1007/s12517-019-4697-1,10.1007/s12517-019-4697-1,"Tikhamarine, Yazid; Souag-Gamane, Doudja; Kisi, Ozgur",ARABIAN JOURNAL OF GEOSCIENCES,Evolutionary algorithms; Grey wolf optimization; Streamflow forecasting; Support vector regression; Wavelet transform,MULTI-VERSE OPTIMIZER; PARTICLE SWARM OPTIMIZATION; ARTIFICIAL NEURAL-NETWORK; GLOBAL OPTIMIZATION; MACHINE; MODEL; DECOMPOSITION; ALGORITHM; PERFORMANCE; CALIBRATION,,SPRINGER HEIDELBERG,HEIDELBERG,"TIERGARTENSTRASSE 17, D-69121 HEIDELBERG, GERMANY",1866-7511,1866-7538,,ARAB J GEOSCI,Arab.

462,Multiobjective Optimization of Seasonal Operating Rules for Water Grids Using Streamflow Forecast Information,"Multiobjective simulation-optimization is a useful tool for determining operating rules for water supply that are optimal for multiple management objectives and expected conditions over the planning period. Previous studies have shown the benefits of streamflow forecasts in improving optimized objective performance of reservoir operating rules. This study demonstrates a simple method for incorporating publicly available streamflow forecast information in operational planning for a water grid. Multiobjective optimization is used to find operating rules for a case study that are optimal for three management objectivesmaximizing minimum system storage, minimizing operational cost, and minimizing spills from reservoirsand for forecast inflow scenarios. These forecast-optimized rules are compared to those optimized using inflow scenarios from the historical distribution, representing operation in the absence of forecast information. The results across four seasonal (3-month) planning periods indicate that, on average, operating rules optimized using forecast streamflow information perform slightly better in terms of the management objectives than those optimized using historical inflow information. Using multiple scenarios of inflow that span the forecast distribution increases the robustness of the operating rules and reduces the risk of underperformance because of forecast inaccuracy. The results suggest that incorporating streamflow forecast information into multiobjective simulation-optimization has the potential to provide improvements in seasonal operating rules for a water grid.",https://doi.org/10.1061/(ASCE)WR.1943-5452.0000902,10.1061/(ASCE)WR.1943-5452.0000902,"Ashbolt, Stephanie C.; Perera, B.

464,Operational and emerging capabilities for surface water flood forecasting,"Surface water (or pluvial) flooding is caused by intense rainfall before it enters rivers or drainage systems. As the climate changes and urban populations grow, the number of people around the world at risk of surface water flooding is increasing. Although it may not be possible to prevent such flooding, reliable and timely flood forecasts can help improve preparedness and recovery. Unlike riverine and coastal flooding where forecasting methods are well established, surface water flood forecasting presents a unique challenge due to the high uncertainties around predicting the location, timing, and impact of what are typically localized events. Over the past 5 years, there has been rapid development of convection-permitting numerical weather prediction models, ensemble forecasting, and computational ability. It is now theoretically feasible to develop operational surface water forecasting systems. This paper identifies three approaches to surface water forecasting utilizing state-of-the-art meteorological forecasts: empirical-based scenarios, hydrological forecasts linked to presimulated impact scenarios, and real-time hydrodynamic simulation. Reviewing operational examples of each approach provides an opportunity to learn from international best practice to develop targeted, impact-based, surface water forecasts to support informed decision-making. Although the emergence of new meteorological and hydrological forecasting capabilities is promising, there remains a scientific limit to the predictability of convective rainfall. To overcome this challenge, we suggest that a rethink of the established role of flood forecasting is needed, alongside the development of interdisciplinary solutions for communicating uncertainty and making the best use of all available data to increase preparedness.

465,Impact of different types of meteorological data inputs on predicted hydrological and erosive responses to projected land use changes,"Hydrological responses to land use/land cover (LULC) changes are complex in nature and tend to have an impact on the hydrological cycle, affecting the livelihood of the inhabitants. Rainfall-runoff models, such as the Soil and Water Assessment Tool, were used in the past to unravel the interactions between the impacts of climate and land use changes. However, the sensitivity of the model outcome, regarding the hydrological and erosive response to climatic data derived with different methods, has not been fully understood. We carried out a hydrological simulation using (a) Climate Forecast System Reanalysis data set, which synthesises outputs of global climate models along with gauged weather information and has a global coverage, and (b) purely weather station-based gridded climate data provided by Indian Meteorological Department. A possible LULC scenario for the year 2020 was created using the combined Cellular Automata-Markov model. Application of both climate data sets resulted in a modest increase in the predicted streamflow and sediment yield as a response to the probable development scenario in 2020. However, the marked variations emerged in the location and monthly pattern of significant changes in the surface runoff and sediment yield in response to the likely LULC scenario for 2020 vis-a-vis 2010.",https://doi.org/10.1007/s12040-019-1076-y,10.1007/s12040-019-1076-y,"Bhattacharyya, Suman; Sanyal, Joy",JOURNAL OF EARTH SYSTEM SCIENCE,Land use change prediction; SWAT; hydrological response; CFSR,FORECAST SYSTEM REANALYSIS; ASSESSMENT-TOOL SWAT; SEDIMENT YIELD; CELLULAR-AUTOMATA; WATER-RESOURCES; COVER CHANGE; CLIMATE; CATCHMENT; MODEL; SOIL,,INDIAN ACAD SCIENCES,BANGALORE,"C V RAMAN AVENUE, SADASHIVANAGAR, P B #8005, BANGALORE 560 080, INDIA",2347-4327,0973-774X,,J EARTH SYST SCI,J.

466,Evaluating essential processes and forecast requirements for meteotsunami-induced coastal flooding,"Meteotsunamis pose a unique threat to coastal communities and often lead to damage of coastal infrastructure, deluge of nearby property, and loss of life and injury. The Great Lakes are a known hot-spot of meteotsunami activity and serve as an important region for investigation of essential hydrodynamic processes and model forecast requirements in meteotsunami-induced coastal flooding. For this work, we developed an advanced hydrodynamic model and evaluate key model attributes and dynamic processes, including: (1) coastal model grid resolution and wetting and drying process in low-lying zones, (2) coastal infrastructure, including breakwaters and associated submerging and overtopping processes, (3) annual/seasonal (ambient) water level change, and (4) wind wave-current coupling. Numerical experiments are designed to evaluate the importance of these attributes to meteotsunami modeling, including a representative storm scenario in the context of regional climate change in which a meteotsunami wave is generated under high ambient lake-level conditions with a preferable wind direction and speed for wind-wave growth. Results demonstrate that accurate representation of coastal topography and fully resolving associated hydrodynamic processes are critical to forecasting the realistic hazards associated with meteotsunami events. As most of existing coastal forecast systems generally do not resolve many of these features due to insufficient model grid resolution or lack of essential model attributes, this work shows that calibrating or assessing existing forecast models against coastal water level gauges alone may result in underestimating the meteotsunami hazard, particularly when gauging stations are sparse and located behind harbor breakwaters or inside estuaries, which represent dampened or otherwise unrepresentative pictures of meteotsunami intensity. This work is the first hydrodynamic modeling of meteotsunami-induced coastal flooding for the Great Lakes, and serves as a template to guide where resources may be most beneficial in forecast system development and implementation.",https://doi.org/10.1007/s11069-021-05007-x,10.1007/s11069-021-05007-x,"Huang, Chenfu; Anderson, Eric; Liu, Yi; Ma, Gangfeng; Mann, Greg; Xue, Pengfei",NATURAL HAZARDS,Great lakes; Meteotsunami; Coastal flooding; Hydrodynamics; Lake Michigan; Coastal hazards,HYDRODYNAMIC MODEL; LAKE-MICHIGAN; SWAN MODEL; CLIMATE; SIMULATION; WAVES,,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"ONE NEW YORK PLAZA, SUITE 4600, NEW YORK, NY, UNITED STATES",0921-030X,1573-0840,,NAT HAZARDS,Nat.

467,Improved Medium- and Long-Term Runoff Forecasting Using a Multimodel Approach in the Yellow River Headwaters Region Based on Large-Scale and Local-Scale Climate Information,"Medium- and long-term runoff forecasting is essential for hydropower generation and water resources coordinated regulation in the Yellow River headwaters region. Climate change has a great impact on runoff within basins, and incorporating different climate information into runoff forecasting can assist in creating longer lead-times in planning periods. In this paper, a multimodel approach was developed to further improve the accuracy and reliability of runoff forecasting fully considering of large-scale and local-scale climatic factors. First, with four large-scale atmospheric oscillations, sea surface temperature, precipitation, and temperature as the predictors, multiple linear regression (MLR), radial basis function neural network (RBFNN), and support vector regression (SVR) models were built. Next, a Bayesian model averaging (BMA)-based multimodel was developed using weighted MLR, RBFNN, and SVR models, and the performance of the BMA-based multimodel was compared to those of the MLR, RBFNN, and SVR models. Finally, the high-runoff performance of these four models was further analyzed to prove the effectiveness of each model. The BMA-based multimodel performed better than those of the other models, as well as high-runoff forecasting. The results also revealed that the performance of the forecasting models with multiple climatic factors were generally superior to that without climatic factors. The BMA-based multimodel with climatic factors not only provides a promising, reliable method for medium-and long-term runoff forecasting, but also facilitates uncertainty estimation under different confidence intervals.",https://doi.org/10.3390/w9080608,10.3390/w9080608,"Chu, Haibo; Wei, Jiahua; Li, Jiaye; Qiao, Zhen; Cao, Jiongwei",WATER,runoff forecasting; support vector regression; multiple climatic factors; Bayesian model averaging; multimodel; Yellow River headwaters,SUPPORT VECTOR REGRESSION; MODEL; STREAMFLOW; OPTIMIZATION; NETWORK; ALGORITHM; IMPACTS; BASIN; FLOW,,MDPI,BASEL,"ST ALBAN-ANLAGE 66, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND",2073-4441,,,WATER-SUI,Water,AUG,2017,9,8,,,608,

This paper proposed a missing-aware-weighted hidden markov model (MWMO-HMM) combining expectation maximization algorithm (EM) with a weighted multi-order HMM to build groundwater quality prediction model with incomplete short-term observations. The proposed model was used to predict hydrogen ion concentration (PH) and chemical oxygen demand (COD) of groundwater in five representative cities. The Nash-Sutcliffe model efficiency coefficients of MWMO-HMM prediction results are respectively 61.51% and 98.06%. Compared with prediction results achieved by auto-regressive and moving average model (ARMA) and gray model (GM), the results show that MWMO-HMM is superior to ARMA and GM, ARMA and GM demonstrate an unstable performance of forecasting. In addition, missing value has a greater effect on ARMA than GM. Furthermore, the integral observations filled with EM algorithm indicates that COD concentration of karst groundwater in Guizhou is affected to some extent by the surface precipitation. The proposed model can predict groundwater quality effectively and meet the management requirements in groundwater prediction based on disintegrated small sample datasets.

470,Assessing Countermeasure Effectiveness in Controlling Cyanobacterial Exceedance in Riverine Systems Using Probabilistic Forecasting Alternatives,"Cyanobacterial blooms are expected to be more frequent over time as more favorable environmental conditions are created in a warming climate. This study proposes strategies to effectively mitigate/reduce the concentration of cyanobacterial blooms based on probabilistic modeling. The model adopted in this study is a probabilistic forecasting model of cyanobacteria cell counts that uses two dominant variables contributing to cyanobacterial bloom in a river: water temperature (T) and water velocity (V). Both T and V can be manipulated by controlling the upstream flow in the river through altering reservoir operations, thereby changing water release downstream. We test and evaluate a variety of discharge scenarios in two river systems in South Korea. Our findings suggest that releasing cold dam water is quite effective in suppressing cyanobacterial bloom growth. We extend the analysis by also including the cost of each operation and conducting a cost-benefit analysis. Following this, we propose response scenarios for each river system by which optimal proactive actions can be taken according to river conditions.

471,"Verification of forecasts for extreme rainfall, tropical cyclones, flood and storm surge over Myanmar and the Philippines","Within the humanitarian sector, there is a pressing need to scale up anticipatory action as climate change-related disasters increase. This article evaluates forecasts relating to extreme weather events - extreme rainfall, tropical cyclones, river flooding and storm surge - in Myanmar and the Philippines to assess the feasibility of using such forecasts to develop early warning systems and responses. To make best use of limited extant data, a variety of methods (reliability diagrams, hit rates, false alarm ratios, correlations) are employed. We review the skill of the European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts (ECMWF) tropical cyclone forecasts and find that whilst errors in cyclone position are relatively small, forecasting intensity is more difficult. When a tropical cyclone has formed, the probabilities provided in the ECMWF track forecast are highly reliable and only slightly over-confident. A tropical cyclone activity product is relatively reliable for forecasts less than a week ahead for North Indian Ocean cyclones affecting Myanmar, but becomes very overconfident beyond this. Looking at flood forecasting models, a comparison of the Global Flood Awareness System (GloFAS, produced by the ECMWF and the European Commission as part of the Copernicus Emergency Management Services) with the Global Flood Forecasting Information System (GLOFFIS, produced by Deltares) demonstrates that both GloFAS and GLOFFIS have difficulty simulating 1 in 2 year return period flows or higher, although GloFAS performance is better than GLOFFIS. GloFAS reforecasts show significantly overconfident probabilities over Myanmar where discharge observations are available, whilst the lack of a GLOFFIS reforecast prevents evaluation of this forecast system directly. Evaluation of the ten-day operational storm surge forecast (the Global Storm Surge Information System, GLOSSIS) produced by Deltares was attempted but lack of any data prevented assessment. These findings present valuable insights into how well forecasts perform, which is crucial information for establishing effective humanitarian action mechanisms.",https://doi.org/10.1016/j.wace.2021.100325,10.1016/j.wace.2021.100325,"MacLeod, David; Easton-Calabria, Evan; Perez, Erin Coughlan de; Jaime, Catalina",WEATHER AND CLIMATE EXTREMES,Forecast verification; Forecast-based financing; Anticipatory action; Extreme rainfall; Tropical cyclones; Floods; Storm surge; Myanmar; Philippines; Southeast asia,PREDICTION; ENSEMBLE,,ELSEVIER,AMSTERDAM,"RADARWEG 29, 1043 NX AMSTERDAM, NETHERLANDS",2212-0947,,,WEATHER CLIM EXTREME,Weather Clim.

472,The role of rating curve uncertainty in real-time flood forecasting,"Data assimilation has been widely tested for flood forecasting, although its use in operational systems is mainly limited to a simple statistical error correction. This can be due to the complexity involved in making more advanced formal assumptions about the nature of the model and measurement errors. Recent advances in the definition of rating curve uncertainty allow estimating a flow measurement error that includes both aleatory and epistemic uncertainties more explicitly and rigorously than in the current practice. The aim of this study is to understand the effect such a more rigorous definition of the flow measurement error has on real-time data assimilation and forecasting. This study, therefore, develops a comprehensive probabilistic framework that considers the uncertainty in model forcing data, model structure, and flow observations. Three common data assimilation techniques are evaluated: (1) Autoregressive error correction, (2) Ensemble Kalman Filter, and (3) Regularized Particle Filter, and applied to two locations in the flood-prone Oria catchment in the Basque Country, northern Spain. The results show that, although there is a better match between the uncertain forecasted and uncertain true flows, there is a low sensitivity for the threshold exceedances used to issue flood warnings. This suggests that a standard flow measurement error model, with a spread set to a fixed flow fraction, represents a reasonable trade-off between complexity and realism. Standard models are therefore recommended for operational flood forecasting for sites with well-defined stage-discharge curves that are based on a large range of flow observations. Plain Language Summary Flood early warning systems are an efficient and affordable tool to mitigate flood risks without altering the fluvial ecosystems. Their benefits rely, however, on an accurate prediction of the timing and magnitude of flood peaks. As in any mathematical simulation of natural processes, flood forecasts must deal with several sources of uncertainty. To reduce them, a standard practice is to compare the outputs of the hydrological model with real-time observations in order to understand and correct the registered deviations. In operational systems, streamflow measurements are thought to be error-free or having a typical, although arbitrary, error. The impact of this choice has been little investigated. Recent advances in the characterization of rating curve uncertainty allow now a more objective definition of the streamflow measurement error, whose consideration in flood forecasting might improve the quality of the flood warnings. While this research has proven this, it has also shown that, when the deterministic rating curve is based on a broad range of flow gaugings, its use while correcting the hydrological model can still lead to good forecasts. Hence, the loss of accuracy may not be significant enough to justify an increase in complexity and computational costs.",https://doi.org/10.1002/2016WR020225,10.1002/2016WR020225,"Ocio, David; Le Vine, Nataliya; Westerberg, Ida; Pappenberger, Florian; Buytaert, Wouter",WATER RESOURCES RESEARCH,real-time flood forecasting; rating curve uncertainty; data assimilation; flow measurement error,ENSEMBLE KALMAN FILTER; HYDROLOGICAL DATA ASSIMILATION; PARAMETER-ESTIMATION; PARTICLE FILTER; MODEL; MANAGEMENT; FREQUENCY; SCHEME; STATES,,AMER GEOPHYSICAL UNION,WASHINGTON,"2000 FLORIDA AVE NW, WASHINGTON, DC 20009 USA",0043-1397,1944-7973,,WATER RESOUR RES,Water Resour.

473,A real-time probabilistic channel flood-forecasting model based on the Bayesian particle filter approach,"Reliable real-time probabilistic flood forecasting is critical for effective water management and flood protection all over the world. In this study, we develop a real-time probabilistic channel flood-forecasting model by combining a channel hydraulic model with the Bayesian particle filter approach. The new model is tested in the upstream river reach of Three Gorges Dam (TGD) on the Yangtze River, China. Stage observations at seven hydrological stations are used simultaneously to adjust the Manning's roughness coefficients and to update discharges and stages along the river reach to attain reliable probabilistic flood forecasting. The synthetic experiments are applied to demonstrate the new model's correction and forecasting performances. The real-world experiments show that the new model can make accurate flood forecasting as well as derive reliable intervals for different confidence levels. The new probabilistic flood forecasting model not only outperforms the existing deterministic channel flood-forecasting models in accuracy, but also provides a more robust tool with which to incorporate uncertainty into flood-control efforts.

474,The challenge of forecasting impacts of flash floods: test of a simplified hydraulic approach and validation based on insurance claim data,"Up to now, flash flood monitoring and forecasting systems, based on rainfall radar measurements and distributed rainfall-runoff models, generally aimed at estimating flood magnitudes - typically discharges or return periods - at selected river cross sections. The approach presented here goes one step further by proposing an integrated forecasting chain for the direct assessment of flash flood possible impacts on inhabited areas (number of buildings at risk in the presented case studies). The proposed approach includes, in addition to a distributed rainfall-runoff model, an automatic hydraulic method suited for the computation of flood extent maps on a dense river network and over large territories. The resulting catalogue of flood extent maps is then combined with land use data to build a flood impact curve for each considered river reach, i.e. the number of inundated buildings versus discharge. These curves are finally used to compute estimated impacts based on forecasted discharges. The approach has been extensively tested in the regions of Ales and Draguignan, located in the south of France, where well-documented major flash floods recently occurred. The article presents two types of validation results. First, the automatically computed flood extent maps and corresponding water levels are tested against rating curves at available river gauging stations as well as against local reference or observed flood extent maps. Second, a rich and comprehensive insurance claim database is used to evaluate the relevance of the estimated impacts for some recent major floods.",https://doi.org/10.5194/hess-21-5911-2017,10.5194/hess-21-5911-2017,"Le Bihan, Guillaume; Payrastre, Olivier; Gaume, Eric; Moncoulon, David; Pons, Frederic",HYDROLOGY AND EARTH SYSTEM SCIENCES,,DISTRIBUTED HYDROLOGICAL MODEL; REAL-TIME SATELLITE; WARNING SYSTEM; GARD REGION; PRONE AREAS; HAZARD MAPS; FRANCE; PREDICTION; BASINS; RIVER,,COPERNICUS GESELLSCHAFT MBH,GOTTINGEN,"BAHNHOFSALLEE 1E, GOTTINGEN, 37081, GERMANY",1027-5606,1607-7938,,HYDROL EARTH SYST SC,Hydrol.

475,Effect of Different Areal Precipitation Estimation Methods on the Accuracy of a Reservoir Runoff Inflow Forecast Model,"Areal precipitation estimation directly affects the accuracy of reservoir runoff inflow forecasts and flood dispatching decision-making. Because of the heterogeneous spatial and temporal precipitation distributions in large basins, inadequate precipitation stations normally have a negative impact on forecast accuracy. Using the Panjia-kou reservoir runoff inflow forecast as the research subject, this paper adopts the Thiessen polygon block, square grid computing, and DEM (digital elevation model) methods to estimate average regional areal precipitation. Based on the estimation, a model for the Panjia-kou reservoir runoff forecast is developed. The results indicate that different areal precipitation estimation methods have significantly different effects on the accuracy of the reservoir runoff inflow forecast. When the average regional precipitation estimation from the DEM method is used as an input to the model, the simulation results are accurate and are much better than those from the other two average regional precipitation estimation methods.",https://doi.org/10.1088/1755-1315/208/1/012043,10.1088/1755-1315/208/1/012043,"Zhong, Wei; Li, Ruirui; Liu, Yan Quan; Xu, Jin",2018 INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE ON AIR POLLUTION AND ENVIRONMENTAL ENGINEERING (APEE 2018),,,,IOP PUBLISHING LTD,BRISTOL,"DIRAC HOUSE, TEMPLE BACK, BRISTOL BS1 6BE, ENGLAND",1755-1307,,,IOP C SER EARTH ENV,IOP Conf.

476,Predictors of visitors' climate-related coping behaviors in a nature-based tourism destination,"Climate change affects the supply of nature-based tourism opportunities as well as the demand visitors place on those opportunities. Climate-induced changes in visitor demand, specifically climate-related coping behaviors (e.g., seeking safer recreation sites, changing trip timing, using weather forecasts to plan trips), are influenced by multiple factors such as season of visit, specific visitor attributes, and general climate change beliefs and concern. Understanding the relationships between visitor characteristics and coping behaviors within the context of a changing climate will help recreation managers and tourism providers anticipate shifts in demand and adapt strategically. In this study, we present results from a series of binary logistic regression models of summer and winter visitor survey data to examine climate-related coping behaviors within a regional nature-based tourism area (the North Shore region of Lake Superior in Minnesota). Findings reveal that winter recreationists, younger visitors, and visitors who are concerned about climate change, are most inclined to use behavioral coping in response to changing climate and environmental conditions. Specifically, we found that winter season recreationists are much more likely to report having experienced a past climate-related impact, and that weather information, alternative gear, and flexibility in timing their trips are important in overcoming these constraints. Further, younger visitors were more likely to use informational (weather forecast) coping, site substitution, and activity substitution to respond to climate-related impacts. This study expands upon climate-related recreation and tourism research by documenting how recreationists' informational, spatial, and temporal coping behaviors vary across visitor characteristics. Further research is needed to determine if the behavioral coping preferences and patterns found in this study emerge across diverse contexts. However, our findings here can help managers begin to strategically plan and collaborate to maintain destination-level attractiveness to visitors despite changing environmental conditions. Management implications: Understanding how visitors respond to environmental changes is important in sustaining 'weather-resistant' visitor flows. In anticipation of on-site disruptions and future demand shifts, regional partnerships within nature-based destinations may mitigate reductions in visitor demand and accommodate shifting patterns in visitor flows. For example, recreation managers and tourism providers could identify and jointly market alternative recreation opportunities when conditions are not conducive to participating in desired activities, as well as develop a networked approach for communicating weather and site safety information.",https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jort.2019.03.005,10.1016/j.jort.2019.03.005,"McCreary, Allie; Seekamp, Erin; Larson, Lincoln L.; Smith, Jordan W.; Davenport, Mae A.",JOURNAL OF OUTDOOR RECREATION AND TOURISM-RESEARCH PLANNING AND MANAGEMENT,Climate change; Worry; Concern; Climate change beliefs; Outdoor recreation; Season,OUTDOOR RECREATION; WEATHER CONDITIONS; ADAPTATION; SUBSTITUTION; INFORMATION; LEADERSHIP; RESOURCE; ANGLERS; IMPACT; SKIERS,,ELSEVIER,AMSTERDAM,"RADARWEG 29, 1043 NX AMSTERDAM, NETHERLANDS",2213-0780,2213-0799,,J OUTDOOR REC TOUR,J.

However, this kind of system has never been implemented in Russia. OpenForecast v2-the first national-scale operational runoff forecasting system in Russia-has been developed and deployed to fill this gap. OpenForecast v2 delivers 7 day-ahead streamflow forecasts for 843 gauges across Russia. The verification study has been carried out using 244 gauges for which operational streamflow data were openly available and quality-controlled for the entire verification period (14 March-6 July 2020). The results showed that the developed system provides reliable and skillful runoff forecasts for up to one week. The benchmark testing against climatology and persistence forecasts showed that the system provides skillful predictions for most analyzed basins.

478,Predictability of Seasonal Streamfiow and Soil Moisture in National Water Model and a Humid Alabama-Coosa-Tallapoosa River Basin,"This study investigates the potential predictability of streamflow and soil moisture in the Alabama-Coosa-Tallapoosa (ACT) river basin in the southeastern United States. The study employs the state-of-the-art National Water Model (NWM) and compares the effects of initial soil moisture condition with those of seasonal climate anomalies on streamflow and soil moisture forecast skills. We have designed and implemented seasonal streamflow forecast ensemble experiments following the methodology suggested by Dirmeyer et al. The study also compares the soil moisture variability in the NWM with in situ measurements and remote sensing data from the Soil Moisture Active and Passive (SMAP) satellite. The NWM skillfully simulates the observed streamflow in the ACT basin. The soil moisture variability is 46% smaller in the NWM compared with the SMAP data, mainly due to a weaker amplitude of the seasonal cycle. This study finds that initial soil moisture condition is a major source of predictability for the seasonal streamflow forecast. The contribution of the initial soil moisture condition is comparable or even higher than that of seasonal climate anomaly effects in dry seasons. In the boreal summer season, the initial soil moisture condition contributes to 65% and 48% improvements in the seasonal streamflow and soil moisture forecast skills, respectively. This study attributes a greater improvement in the streamflow forecast skill to the lag effects between the soil moisture and streamflow anomalies. The results of this study can inform the development and improvement of the operational streamflow forecasting system.",https://doi.org/10.1175/JHM-D-19-0206.1,10.1175/JHM-D-19-0206.1,"Duan, Yanan; Kumar, Sanjiv",JOURNAL OF HYDROMETEOROLOGY,,UNITED-STATES; MISSISSIPPI RIVER; CLIMATE MODELS; WARMING HOLE; VARIABILITY; SURFACE; PREDICTION; FORECASTS; RESOURCES; SKILL,,AMER METEOROLOGICAL SOC,BOSTON,"45 BEACON ST, BOSTON, MA 02108-3693 USA",1525-755X,1525-7541,,J HYDROMETEOROL,J.

479,Appraising trends and forecasting of hydroclimatic variables in the north and northeast regions of Bangladesh,"Appraising trend and forecasting of seasonal and annual rainfall, temperature, river water discharge, and groundwater level are crucial for local water resource practices and designing agricultural crop production. However, the spatiotemporal trends of these hydroclimatic variables remain uncertain under the changing climate at the regional scale. Therefore, we analyzed hydroclimatic variable trends in the north and northeast regions of Bangladesh for 38 years (1980-2017) using a set of parametric and non-parametric techniques and forecasted by the Autoregressive Integrated Moving Average (ARIMA) model. Based on detrended fluctuation analysis, long-range associations of the hydroclimatic variables suggested that these variables will retain their current trend line in the forthcoming period. Annual temperature and river water discharge exhibited an increasing linear trend of 0.014 degrees C and 0.61 m(3) s(-1) per year, while annual rainfall demonstrated a declining linear trend of - 0.87 mm and resultant in an annual water level decrease of - 0.03 m per year. Seasonal maximum trends were observed for rainfall in the winter (- 2.25 mm), the temperature in monsoon (0.03 degrees C) and water discharge in post-monsoon (10.7 m(3) s(-1)), and water level in post-monsoon (- 0.54 m) per year. The ARIMA model forecasted that the temperature would be increased by 0.14 degrees C/decade and water discharge will be 8.75 m(3) s(-1)/decade, while rainfall and water level will be decreased by 90 mm/decade and 1.24 m/decade respectively for the period 2018-2027.

480,"Potential skill of continental-scale, medium-range ensemble streamflow forecasts for flood prediction in South America","Recent scientific and computational developments have pushed hydrological forecasting systems up to continental and global scales. In this study, we evaluate the potential skill of ensemble streamflow forecasts for flood prediction in South America (SA), with a closer look on some of the large basins of the continent. Medium-range precipitation forecasts from the ECMWF Ensemble Prediction System were used to force a continental-scale, fully coupled hydrologic-hydrodynamic model to produce streamflow forecasts up to 15 days in advance. Forecasts were evaluated over a 4-year period against a reference simulation, derived from the hydrological model forced with a gridded precipitation dataset that merges data from multiple sources (MSWEP). To provide a benchmark for assessing the potential skill, forecasts based on the Ensemble Streamflow Prediction (ESP) technique were produced by running the hydrological model with precipitation data resampled from past MSWEP observations. Overall, ECMWF-based forecasts were skillful mainly at the eastern and southeastern regions of the continent (e.g., Sao Francisco, Parnaiba, Upper Parana, Tocantins-Araguaia and Uruguay basins), showing little or no added skill in large rivers draining the Andes such as the Magdalena, Orinoco, Madeira (Amazon) and right-bank tributaries of the Paraguay. In the latter basins, ECMWF-based forecasts largely overestimated the exceedance probabilities of critical thresholds due to a positive bias in the predicted precipitation (in relation to MSWEP), visible mostly during the wet season. In addition, forecasts were found to perform better than ESP in terms of both overall quality and discrimination skill at regions characterized by a warm temperate, fully-humid climate. A direct relation between forecast skill and basin size was not always valid, since the former can vary geographically along tributaries. Limitations and future developments needed for continental-scale hydrological forecasting in SA are also discussed.",https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jhydrol.2020.125430,10.1016/j.jhydrol.2020.125430,"Siqueira, Vinicius Alencar; Fan, Fernando Mainardi; Dias de Paiva, Rodrigo Cauduro; Ramos, Maria-Helena; Collischonn, Walter",JOURNAL OF HYDROLOGY,Ensemble forecasting; Southern hemisphere; Hydrologic modeling; Skill; CRPSS; AROC,HYDROLOGICAL ENSEMBLE; METEOROLOGICAL FORECASTS; ALERT SYSTEM; PRECIPITATION; MODEL; RIVER; SATELLITE; BASIN; CLIMATE; IMPACT,,ELSEVIER,AMSTERDAM,"RADARWEG 29, 1043 NX AMSTERDAM, NETHERLANDS",0022-1694,1879-2707,,J HYDROL,J.

481,Bayesian flood forecasting methods: A review,"Over the past few decades, floods have been seen as one of the most common and largely distributed natural disasters in the world. If floods could be accurately forecasted in advance, then their negative impacts could be greatly minimized. It is widely recognized that quantification and reduction of uncertainty associated with the hydrologic forecast is of great importance for flood estimation and rational decision making. Bayesian forecasting system (BFS) offers an ideal theoretic framework for uncertainty quantification that can be developed for probabilistic flood forecasting via any deterministic hydrologic model. It provides suitable theoretical structure, empirically validated models and reasonable analytic numerical computation method, and can be developed into various Bayesian forecasting approaches. This paper presents a comprehensive review on Bayesian forecasting approaches applied in flood forecasting from 1999 till now. The review starts with an overview of fundamentals of BFS and recent advances in BFS, followed with BFS application in river stage forecasting and real-time flood forecasting, then move to a critical analysis by evaluating advantages and limitations of Bayesian forecasting methods and other predictive uncertainty assessment approaches in flood forecasting, and finally discusses the future research direction in Bayesian flood forecasting. Results show that the Bayesian flood forecasting approach is an effective and advanced way for flood estimation, it considers all sources of uncertainties and produces a predictive distribution of the river stage, river discharge or runoff, thus gives more accurate and reliable flood forecasts. Some emerging Bayesian forecasting methods (e.g. ensemble Bayesian forecasting system, Bayesian multi-model combination) were shown to overcome limitations of single model or fixed model weight and effectively reduce predictive uncertainty. In recent years, various Bayesian flood forecasting approaches have been developed and widely applied, but there is still room for improvements. Future research in the context of Bayesian flood forecasting should be on assimilation of various sources of newly available information and improvement of predictive performance assessment methods.

482,Novel Ensemble Forecasting of Streamflow Using Locally Weighted Learning Algorithm,"The development of advanced computational models for improving the accuracy of streamflow forecasting could save time and cost for sustainable water resource management. In this study, a locally weighted learning (LWL) algorithm is combined with the Additive Regression (AR), Bagging (BG), Dagging (DG), Random Subspace (RS), and Rotation Forest (RF) ensemble techniques for the streamflow forecasting in the Jhelum Catchment, Pakistan. To build the models, we grouped the initial parameters into four different scenarios (M1-M4) of input data with a five-fold cross-validation (I-V) approach. To evaluate the accuracy of the developed ensemble models, previous lagged values of streamflow were used as inputs whereas the cross-validation technique and periodicity input were used to examine prediction accuracy on the basis of root correlation coefficient (R), root mean squared error (RMSE), mean absolute error (MAE), relative absolute error (RAE), and root relative squared error (RRSE). The results showed that the incorporation of periodicity (i.e., MN) as an additional input variable considerably improved both the training performance and predictive performance of the models. A comparison between the results obtained from the input combinations III and IV revealed a significant performance improvement. The cross-validation revealed that the dataset M3 provided more accurate results compared to the other datasets. While all the ensemble models successfully outperformed the standalone LWL model, the ensemble LWL-AR model was identified as the best model. Our study demonstrated that the ensemble modeling approach is a robust and promising alternative to the single forecasting of streamflow that should be further investigated with different datasets from other regions around the world.",https://doi.org/10.3390/su13115877,10.3390/su13115877,"Adnan, Rana Muhammad; Jaafari, Abolfazl; Mohanavelu, Aadhityaa; Kisi, Ozgur; Elbeltagi, Ahmed",SUSTAINABILITY,ensemble modeling; additive regression; bagging; dagging; random subspace; rotation forest,NEURO-FUZZY; CLIMATE-CHANGE; MODELS; WAVELET; RIVER; PERFORMANCE; PREDICTION; REGRESSION; NETWORKS,,MDPI,BASEL,"ST ALBAN-ANLAGE 66, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND",,2071-1050,,SUSTAINABILITY-BASEL,Sustainability,JUN,2021,13,11,,,5877,
483,Developing reservoir monthly inflow forecasts using artificial intelligence and climate phenomenon information,"Reservoirs are fundamental human-built infrastructures that collect, store, and deliver fresh surface water in a timely manner for many purposes. Efficient reservoir operation requires policy makers and operators to understand how reservoir inflows are changing under different hydrological and climatic conditions to enable forecast-informed operations. Over the last decade, the uses of Artificial Intelligence and Data Mining [AI & DM] techniques in assisting reservoir streamflow subseasonal to seasonal forecasts have been increasing. In this study, Random Forest [RF), Artificial Neural Network (ANN), and Support Vector Regression (SVR) are employed and compared with respect to their capabilities for predicting 1 month-ahead reservoir inflows for two headwater reservoirs in USA and China. Both current and lagged hydrological information and 17 known climate phenomenon indices, i.e., PDO and ENSO, etc., are selected as predictors for simulating reservoir inflows. Results show (1) three methods are capable of providing monthly reservoir inflows with satisfactory statistics; (2) the results obtained by Random Forest have the best statistical performances compared with the other two methods; (3) another advantage of Random Forest algorithm is its capability of interpreting raw model inputs; (4) climate phenomenon indices are useful in assisting monthly or seasonal forecasts of reservoir inflow; and (5) different climate conditions are autocorrelated with up to several months, and the climatic information and their lags are cross correlated with local hydrological conditions in our case studies.",https://doi.org/10.1002/2017WR020482,10.1002/2017WR020482,"Yang, Tiantian; Asanjan, Ata Akbari; Welles, Edwin; Gao, Xiaogang; Sorooshian, Soroosh; Liu, Xiaomang",WATER RESOURCES RESEARCH,,NINO-SOUTHERN OSCILLATION; SUPPORT VECTOR MACHINES; WATER-RESOURCES; ATMOSPHERIC RIVERS; NEURAL-NETWORKS; VARIABLE SELECTION; RELEASE RULES; STREAMFLOW; PREDICTION; MODELS,,AMER GEOPHYSICAL UNION,WASHINGTON,"2000 FLORIDA AVE NW, WASHINGTON, DC 20009 USA",0043-1397,1944-7973,,WATER RESOUR RES,Water Resour.

484,Incorporating Antecedent Soil Moisture into Streamflow Forecasting,"This study incorporates antecedent (preceding) soil moisture into forecasting streamflow volumes within the North Platte River Basin, Colorado/Wyoming (USA). The incorporation of antecedent soil moisture accounts for infiltration and can improve streamflow predictions. Current Natural Resource Conservation Service (NRCS) forecasting methods are replicated, and a comparison is drawn between current NRCS forecasts and proposed forecasting methods using antecedent soil moisture. Current predictors used by the NRCS in regression-based streamflow forecasting include precipitation, streamflow persistence (previous season streamflow volume) and snow water equivalent (SWE) from SNOTEL (snow telemetry) sites. Proposed methods utilize antecedent soil moisture as a predictor variable in addition to the predictors noted above. A decision system was used to segregate data based on antecedent soil moisture conditions (e.g., dry, wet or normal). Principal Components Analysis and Stepwise Linear Regression were applied to generate streamflow forecasts, and numerous statistics were determined to measure forecast skill. The results show that when incorporating antecedent soil moisture, the poor forecasts (i.e., years in which the NRCS forecast differed greatly from the observed value) were improved, while the overall forecast skill remains unchanged. The research presented shows the need to increase the monitoring and collection of soil moisture data in mountainous western U.S. watersheds, as this parameter results in improved forecast skill.",https://doi.org/10.3390/hydrology6020050,10.3390/hydrology6020050,"Oubeidillah, Abdoul; Tootle, Glenn; Piechota, Thomas",HYDROLOGY,streamflow; antecedent soil moisture; snowpack,RAINFALL,,MDPI,BASEL,"ST ALBAN-ANLAGE 66, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND",2306-5338,,,HYDROLOGY-BASEL,Hydrology,JUN,2019,6,2,,,50,
485,Approximating Input Data to a Snowmelt Model Using Weather Research and Forecasting Model Outputs in Lieu of Meteorological Measurements,"Forecasting the timing and magnitude of snowmelt and runoff is critical to managing mountain water resources. Warming temperatures are increasing the rain-snow transition elevation and are limiting the forecasting skill of statistical models relating historical snow water equivalent to streamflow. While physically based methods are available, they require accurate estimations of the spatial and temporal distribution of meteorological variables in complex terrain. Across many mountainous areas, measurements of precipitation and other meteorological variables are limited to a few reference stations and are not adequate to resolve the complex interactions between topography and atmospheric flow. In this paper, we evaluate the ability of the Weather Research and Forecasting (WRF) Model to approximate the inputs required for a physics-based snow model, iSnobal, instead of using meteorological measurements, for the Boise River Basin (BRB) in Idaho, United States. An iSnobal simulation using station data from 40 locations in and around the BRB resulted in an average root-mean-square error (RMSE) of 4.5 mm compared with 12 SNOTEL measurements. Applying WRF forcings alone was associated with an RMSE of 10.5 mm, while including a simple bias correction to the WRF outputs of temperature and precipitation reduced the RMSE to 6.5 mm. The results highlight the utility of using WRF outputs as input to snowmelt models, as all required input variables are spatiotemporally complete. This will have important benefits in areas with sparse measurement networks and will aid snowmelt and runoff forecasting in mountainous basins.",https://doi.org/10.1175/JHM-D-18-0146.1,10.1175/JHM-D-18-0146.1,"Havens, Scott; Marks, Danny; FitzGerald, Katelyn; Masarik, Matt; Flores, Alejandro N.; Kormos, Patrick; Hedrick, Andrew",JOURNAL OF HYDROMETEOROLOGY,Watersheds; Snowpack; Forcing; Hydrometeorology; Snow cover; Coupled models,RAIN-ON-SNOW; CONTIGUOUS UNITED-STATES; PART II; SPATIAL INTERPOLATION; MOUNTAIN SNOWPACK; CLIMATE-CHANGE; WATER-BALANCE; FORCING DATA; TIME-SERIES; RIVER-BASIN,,AMER METEOROLOGICAL SOC,BOSTON,"45 BEACON ST, BOSTON, MA 02108-3693 USA",1525-755X,1525-7541,,J HYDROMETEOROL,J.

486,A Grand Prediction: Communicating and Evaluating 2018 Summertime Upper Blue Nile Rainfall and Streamflow Forecasts in Preparation for Ethiopia's New Dam,"When complete, the Grand Ethiopian Renaissance Dam (GERD) will be the largest hydropower dam in Africa. The GERD has become a focal point of geopolitical tensions because it will allow Ethiopia greater control over the Blue Nile River, Egypt's main source of freshwater. To inform discussions of filling plans and responses, we created a probabilistic seasonal forecast for Upper Blue Nile rainfall and streamflow in the GERD basin. Eight statistical models and eight dynamical models were used to forecast the rainy season (June-September), which were then converted into river flow for June-December 2018. Both statistical and dynamical models predicted a high probability of average to above average rainfall as well as Upper Blue Nile flow in the GERD basin. Actual summer precipitation in 2018 was slightly below the long-term mean but well within the range considered to be near normal. Leveraging the increasingly online media landscape for science communication, we made the forecast publicly available through a blog and shared with regional decision-makers in advance of the 2018 rainy season. The blog attracted news coverage in the region focusing primarily on the relatively low likelihood of below-average Nile flow across the forecast ensemble. When asked for feedback on the blog, Ethiopian decision-makers and forecasters reported that flow predictions included in our blog were useful and not part of existing products. Access and comprehension were noted barriers to the use of these types of forecasts, consistent with prior research in forecast communication and dissemination. Forecasts available on such blogs can inform a shared understanding among decision-makers in the management of transboundary waters, yet effective communication and dissemination remain a challenge.",https://doi.org/10.3389/frwa.2019.00003,10.3389/frwa.2019.00003,"Blum, Annalise G.; Zaitchik, Ben; Alexander, Sarah; Wu, Shu; Zhang, Ying; Shukla, Shraddhanand; Alemneh, Temesgen; Block, Paul",FRONTIERS IN WATER,seasonal forecasting; blog; Grand Ethiopian Renaissance Dam; science communication; hydropower; Horn of Africa; East Africa; probabilistic forecast,SEASONAL CLIMATE FORECASTS; SCIENCE; PREDICTABILITY; VARIABILITY; INFORMATION; FARMERS; BLOGS,,FRONTIERS MEDIA SA,LAUSANNE,"AVENUE DU TRIBUNAL FEDERAL 34, LAUSANNE, CH-1015, SWITZERLAND",,2624-9375,,FRONT WATER,Front.

487,A comparative study of models for short-term streamflow forecasting with emphasis on wavelet-based approach,"Skilful short-term streamflow forecasting is a challenging task, but useful for addressing a variety of issues associated with water resources planning and management. This study investigates the performance of four popular models for short-term streamflow forecasting, with particular emphasis on the combination of each model with wavelet transform (WT). The autoregressive (AR) model, autoregressive moving average (ARMA) model, artificial neural network (ANN) model, and linear regression (LR) model are used as the base models, and WT-AR, WT-ARMA, WT-ANN, and WT-LR models are used as the composite or hybrid models. These eight models are applied for short-term forecasting of daily streamflow time series in two different river basins in China. Streamflow data from two stations (Yingluoxia and Zhamashike) in the Heihe River basin of North China and two stations (Wuzhou and Longchuan) in the Pearl River basin of South China are considered, and forecasts are made 1-day, 2-day, and 3-day ahead. The accuracy of the models is evaluated using three widely used performance measures: root mean square error, mean absolute error, and correlation coefficient (R). The performances of the eight models are compared, and the influencing role of the wavelet transform in the hybrid models is discussed. The results suggest that the WT-ANN and ANN models are more suitable for the northern basin but perform poorly for the southern basin, while the WT-ARMA model is more suitable for the southern basin. The results also suggest that the wavelet-based hybrid models are better than the single models particularly for longer lead times, offering gradual improvement with increasing lead time. Therefore, the wavelet-based models are especially useful for areas that suffer from frequent natural disasters, fragile ecological environment, and poor self-regulations.",https://doi.org/10.1007/s00477-019-01734-7,10.1007/s00477-019-01734-7,"Sun, Yuqing; Niu, Jun; Sivakumar, Bellie",STOCHASTIC ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH AND RISK ASSESSMENT,Streamflow forecasting; Wavelets; Discrete wavelet transform; Hybrid models; Heihe river basin; Pearl river basin,ARTIFICIAL NEURAL-NETWORKS; STOCHASTIC-MODELS; RAINFALL; RUNOFF; ARMA; PRECIPITATION; REGRESSION; DECOMPOSITION; PREDICTION; ENSEMBLE,,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"233 SPRING ST, NEW YORK, NY 10013 USA",1436-3240,1436-3259,,STOCH ENV RES RISK A,Stoch.

488,Hydrological time series forecasting using simple combinations: Big data testing and investigations on one-year ahead river flow predictability,"Delivering useful hydrological forecasts is critical for urban and agricultural water management, hydropower generation, flood protection and management, drought mitigation and alleviation, and river basin planning and management, among others. In this work, we present and appraise a new simple and flexible methodology for hydrological time series forecasting. This methodology relies on (a) at least two individual forecasting methods and (b) the median combiner of forecasts. The appraisal is made by using a big dataset consisted of 90-year-long mean annual river flow time series from approximately 600 stations. Covering large parts of North America and Europe, these stations represent various climate and catchment characteristics, and thus can collectively support benchmarking. Five individual forecasting methods and 26 variants of the introduced methodology are applied to each time series. The application is made in one-step ahead forecasting mode. The individual methods are the last-observation benchmark, simple exponential smoothing, complex exponential smoothing, automatic autoregressive fractionally integrated moving average (ARFIMA) and Facebook's Prophet, while the 26 variants are defined by all the possible combinations (per two, three, four or five) of the five afore-mentioned methods. The new methodology is identified as well-performing in the long run, especially when more than two individual forecasting methods are combined within its framework. Moreover, the possibility of case-informed integrations of diverse hydrological forecasting methods within systematic frameworks is algorithmically investigated and discussed. The related investigations encompass linear regression analyses, which aim at finding interpretable relationships between the values of a representative forecasting performance metric and the values of selected river flow statistics. We find only loose (but not negligible) relationships between the formed variable sets. These relationships could be exploited for improving (to some extent) future forecasting applications. The results of our big data forecasting experiment are lastly exploited for characterizing -in relative terms- one-year ahead river flow predictability. We believe that our findings have both practical and theoretical implications.",https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jhydrol.2020.125205,10.1016/j.jhydrol.2020.125205,"Papacharalampous, Georgia; Tyralis, Hristos",JOURNAL OF HYDROLOGY,ARFIMA; Combining forecasts; Exponential smoothing; Prophet; Streamflow forecasting; Stochastic hydrology,LONG-RANGE DEPENDENCE; WATER-RESOURCES; FOOD NEXUS; COMBINING FORECASTS; NEURAL-NETWORKS; CLIMATE; MODELS; MANAGEMENT; STREAMFLOW; ENERGY,,ELSEVIER,AMSTERDAM,"RADARWEG 29, 1043 NX AMSTERDAM, NETHERLANDS",0022-1694,1879-2707,,J HYDROL,J.

489,Predicting temperature and precipitation during the flood season based on teleconnection,"In recent years, the damages resulting from abnormal hydrometeorological climate have substantially increased over the world due to the climate variability and change. Especially, the flood damage has been severely occurred during the flood season almost every year in Korea. For an example, we had the localized heavy rainfalls for 54 days in flood season of 2020 and had huge property damage and loss of life. Therefore, the study needs to be conducted to improve the predictive power of seasonal time-scale forecasts spanning one to several months for the damage reduction and prevention. In this regard, this study aims to provide a priori predictions (several months ahead) of the climate variable at target sites with a statistical method based on teleconnection with global climatic conditions. Herein, the paradigm of the temperature and precipitation prediction in the Geum river basin in Korea is presented. The purposes of the study are also (1) to analyse the characteristics of summer temperatures and precipitation according to the occurrence of El Nino/La Nina and (2) to suggest a seasonal prediction model that can consider the effects of the occurrence of El Nino and La Nina during the flood season. The model is constructed by classifying the data period into El Nino, La Nina, and neutral status. Then we have shown that the prediction model improves the predictive power for the predictions of climate variables such as temperature and precipitation at mid-latitude stations which Korea is located. Therefore, this study demonstrates the possibility of improving the predictive power for forecasting temperature and precipitation by the prediction model considering climate variability.",https://doi.org/10.1186/s40562-022-00212-3,10.1186/s40562-022-00212-3,"Jung, Jaewon; Kim, Hung Soo",GEOSCIENCE LETTERS,Climate variability; El Nino; La Nina; Seasonal prediction; Teleconnection,ARCTIC OSCILLATION; CLIMATE; RAINFALL; FORECAST; VARIABILITY; IMPACT; ENSO; PATTERNS; DROUGHT; CHINA,,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"ONE NEW YORK PLAZA, SUITE 4600, NEW YORK, NY, UNITED STATES",2196-4092,,,GEOSCI LETT,Geosci.

490,Performance forecasting for polymer flooding in heavy oil reservoirs,"As a supply for future fuel and energy demand, 95% of the bitumen deposits in North America are expected to become a major source. The Steam Assisted Gravity Drainage (SAGD) provides more efficient recovery of unconventional oil resources, such as heavy oil and bitumen, as compared to the other thermal recovery methods. The drawback associated with SAGD or other thermal methods is that they are economically non-profitable when applied to the deep and thin reservoirs. Environmental concerns related to land, water, and air also hinder the application of the aforementioned methods. These issues have provoked reservoir engineers to employ a remarkable alternate such as polymer flooding recovery technique in heavy oil reservoirs. Quick and practical decision-making process in presence of uncertainty-based reservoir development scenarios is a notable stimuli for reservoir management teams to find substitute modeling techniques for future performance forecasting of heavy oil reservoirs. Cognitive data-driven analytics, including artificial and computational intelligence techniques, statistical analyses, and data-mining practices, offers an attractive alternate especially in presence of high-dimensional data space and predictive modeling of an extremely nonlinear system. This study utilizes an extensive data set from the half-century review of laboratory to field scales polymer flooding in heavy oil reservoirs provided by Saboorian-Jooybari et al. (2015) and (2016). The exploratory data analysis is implemented to construct a comprehensive training data set from polymer flooding experimental and field data, which involves various attributes describing characteristics associated with reservoir heterogeneities and pertinent operating parameters. Demonstrated results imply that this advanced data-driven modeling technique has a great potential to be integrated into all reservoir development tools for future performance predictions of the underlying processes.",https://doi.org/10.1016/j.fuel.2017.11.110,10.1016/j.fuel.2017.11.110,"Amirian, Ehsan; Dejam, Morteza; Chen, Zhangxin",FUEL,Polymer flooding; Heavy oil reservoir; Performance forecasting; Data-driven modeling; Artificial and computational intelligence,ARTIFICIAL NEURAL-NETWORKS; SIMULATION; PREDICTION; RECOVERY; FIELD,,ELSEVIER SCI LTD,OXFORD,"THE BOULEVARD, LANGFORD LANE, KIDLINGTON, OXFORD OX5 1GB, OXON, ENGLAND",0016-2361,1873-7153,,FUEL,Fuel,MAR 15,2018,216,,83,100,,
491,Spatial-temporal evaluation of different reference evapotranspiration methods based on the climate forecast system reanalysis data,"Evapotranspiration is a major component of the interaction between land-surface processes and the atmosphere. Climate Forecast System Reanalysis (CFSR) data offer a promising database for overcoming the limitations in availability and reliability of climatological data and, hence, for understanding the evapotranspiration process. Using these data on grid-by-grid daily, seasonal and yearly scales, the present study attempts to advance the spatio-temporal evaluation of two radiation-based and three temperature-based methods for estimating potential evapotranspiration (PET) against estimates of grass reference evapotranspiration (ETo) by FAO Penman-Monteith method (FAO-PM). The analysis was performed for the period 1979-2013, considering the second largest (79 000 km(2)) river system in Ethiopia, that is, Omo-Gibe basin, which accommodates national parks and vast hydropower, cultivation and afforestation developments and discharges its flow to Lake Turkana in Kenya. Despite the large regional variations in climate and elevation, the results in overall emphasize the outperformance of the simple temperature method, viz. Hargreaves-Samani method, in capturing both the annual and seasonal FAO-PM estimates. Calibration of the Hargreaves-Samani equation is, however, a requisite for spectacular improvement of its performance. Accordingly, new coefficients of the equation are proposed. The annual trends in the basin's ETo increased with rising temperature and decreasing relative humidity, wind speed, and solar radiation, but with decreasing (increasing) rainfall in the upper region (the middle and lower regions). It is deduced that trends in simple methods do not necessarily reflect the true trends in ETo. Annual ETo decreases with increasing elevation and annual rainfall. The present findings are discussed in the context of a worldwide literature, thereby improving the understanding of the best performing PET methods in similar data-scarce national or transboundary rivers basin in Ethiopia, the region or worldwide. The wider implications regarding water loss from reservoirs and the rain-fed food and sugar production in the basin under study are also highlighted.",https://doi.org/10.1002/hyp.14239,10.1002/hyp.14239,"Woldesenbet, Tekalegn Ayele; Elagib, Nadir Ahmed",HYDROLOGICAL PROCESSES,Ethiopia; FAO Penman-Monteith; NCEP CFSR data; Omo-Gibe river basin; radiation-based evapotranspiration methods; temperature-based evapotranspiration methods,HARGREAVES-SAMANI EQUATION; PENMAN-MONTEITH METHOD; REFERENCE CROP EVAPOTRANSPIRATION; POTENTIAL EVAPOTRANSPIRATION; EVAPORATION TRENDS; PAN EVAPORATION; RIVER-BASIN; CALIBRATION; SENSITIVITY; MODELS,,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0885-6087,1099-1085,,HYDROL PROCESS,Hydrol.

492,Comparison of Precipitation and Streamflow Correcting for Ensemble Streamflow Forecasts,"Meteorological centers constantly make efforts to provide more skillful seasonal climate forecast, which has the potential to improve streamflow forecasts. A common approach is to bias-correct the general circulation model (GCM) forecasts prior to generating the streamflow forecasts. Less attention has been paid to the issue of bias-corrected streamflow forecasts that were generated by GCM forecasts. This study compares the effect of bias-corrected GCM forecasts and bias-corrected streamflow outputs on the improvement of streamflow forecast efficiency. Based on the Upper Hanjiang River Basin (UHRB), the authors compare three forecasting scenarios: original forecasts, bias-corrected precipitation forecasts and bias-corrected streamflow forecasts. We apply the quantile mapping method to bias-correct precipitation forecasts and the linear scaling method to bias-correct the original streamflow forecasts. A semi-distributed hydrological model, namely the Tsinghua Representative Elementary Watershed (THREW) model, is employed to transform precipitation into streamflow. The effects of bias-corrected precipitation and bias-corrected streamflow are assessed in terms of accuracy, reliability, sharpness and overall performance. The results show that both bias-corrected precipitation and bias-corrected streamflow can considerably increase the overall forecast skill in comparison to the original streamflow forecasts. Bias-corrected precipitation contributes mainly to improving the forecast reliability and sharpness, while bias-corrected streamflow is successful in increasing the forecast accuracy and overall performance of the ensemble forecasts.",https://doi.org/10.3390/w10020177,10.3390/w10020177,"Li, Yilu; Jiang, Yunzhong; Lei, Xiaohui; Tian, Fuqiang; Duan, Hao; Lu, Hui",WATER,bias-correcting; ECMWF System 4; quantile mapping; linear scaling; Upper Hanjiang River Basin,PROBABILISTIC FORECASTS; BIAS-CORRECTION; MODEL; CALIBRATION; ECMWF; LONG; SKILL; VARIABILITY; PREDICTIONS; REFORECASTS,,MDPI,BASEL,"ST ALBAN-ANLAGE 66, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND",,2073-4441,,WATER-SUI,Water,FEB,2018,10,2,,,177,
493,"Forecasting Urban Expansion in the Seven Lakes Area in San Pablo City, Laguna, the Philippines Using the Land Transformation Model","Managing urban growth is essential to the conservation of the Seven Lakes ecosystem in San Pablo City, Laguna province in the Philippines. This study simulates potential conversion of agricultural lands to built-up areas using the land transformation model (LTM), which integrates geographical information systems (GIS) and an artificial neural network (ANN). Historical drivers of the expansion of built-up areas are identified and validated through the application of LTM to land cover maps from 1988 to 2015. Identified drivers include distance to roads, distance to trails, distance to the Seven Lakes, distance to existing built-up areas, slopes and population density per barangay. Results from the percent correct matrix (PCM) were 79.88 per cent for the 1988-2003 runs and 66.42 per cent for the 2003-2015 runs, while the Kappa statistic for both time periods was higher than 0.60, which indicates high levels of agreement. Forecasted scenarios were business-as-usual (BAU) growth, doubled growth and strict law implementation protecting the vicinity around the Seven Lakes and other natural areas. In the BAU scenario, urban expansion spread out along the road networks. The doubled growth scenario showed that further expansion will likely extend around the proximity of the lakes, which may adversely affect the livelihoods of the local fishing communities. As such, it was recommended that preventive measures, such as strict implementation of buffer zones coupled with regular monitoring, be taken to manage land use in the surrounding lake areas.",https://doi.org/10.1177/0975425317748531,10.1177/0975425317748531,"Laura Quintal, Anna; Kendra Gotangco, Charlotte; Leah Guzman, Maria Aileen",ENVIRONMENT AND URBANIZATION ASIA,Land transformation model; land use and land cover change (LULCC); urbanization; GIS; neural network; San Pablo City,ECOSYSTEM SERVICES,,SAGE PUBLICATIONS LTD,LONDON,"1 OLIVERS YARD, 55 CITY ROAD, LONDON EC1Y 1SP, ENGLAND",0975-4253,0976-3546,,ENVIRON URBAN ASIA,Environ.

494,Forecast-informed hydropower optimization at long and short-time scales for a multiple dam network,"This study presents a scheme for co-optimizing the long-term (seasonal) reservoir operating objectives with the short-term (daily) objectives for multi-dam networks to maximize hydropower generation. Long-term optimal reservoir storage provides temporal space to optimize operation of the dams at short-term based on forecasted reservoir inflow. This study asks if there is an added benefit of co-optimization of operations at long- and short-term scales for hydropower generation. The multi-objective optimization problem at both the temporal scales was simultaneously solved considering Pareto optimality between conflicting objectives. Constraints pertaining to flood control, dam safety, and environmental flow were imposed. The proposed scheme was implemented over a network of Blue Mesa, Morrow Point, and Crystal dams in the Upper Colorado Basin. Ensemble forecast forcings from publicly available numerical weather prediction and climate models were used as inputs for the daily and monthly scale inflow forecasts. The results show improvements of 41%, 27%, and 15% in hydropower generation using the co-optimization during wet, moderate, and dry years, respectively, against a benchmark that neglects inflow forecasts. This study demonstrates added benefit of co-optimizing the operations for hydropower generation based on short- and long-term forecasted reservoir inflow. Given that most dams today operate as a network in a river basin, we recommend moving away from single dam and single time scale optimization to a multiple-dam with long- and short-term scale co-optimization-based operations to make renewable energy generation more efficient.",https://doi.org/10.1063/1.5124097,10.1063/1.5124097,"Ahmad, Shahryar Khalique; Hossain, Faisal",JOURNAL OF RENEWABLE AND SUSTAINABLE ENERGY,,TERM RESERVOIR OPERATION; STREAMFLOW FORECASTS; ECONOMIC VALUE; MODEL; WATER; SYSTEM; IMPACT; RULES,,AMER INST PHYSICS,MELVILLE,"1305 WALT WHITMAN RD, STE 300, MELVILLE, NY 11747-4501 USA",1941-7012,,,J RENEW SUSTAIN ENER,J.

Out of various approaches, soft computing data-driven models are very helpful for the purpose of forecasting. Soft computing models are usefully applicable when the relationship between the parameters is very complex to understand. India is a disaster-prone country which requires such major soft computing-based data-driven models to handle disasters like flood, drought and landslide. Flood has a major impact in many regions of India out of which Cauvery, Godavari and Ganges river basins are the most affected regions. The paper attempts to forecast floods by modeling river flow into the area of Godavari river basin of India which has a complicated topography.

Predicting the amount of dissolved oxygen (DO) of a water environment is vital and can improve the aquaculture production efficiency. Using water quality and meteorological data for the Changdang Lake (Jiangsu, China) from 2014 to 2016, this study proposes a new strategy for predicting short-term DO based on K-means clustering and extreme learning machine (ELM) neural networks. First, the weights of the environmental factors on the DO are obtained using Pearson correlation analysis, and similar days are defined. Subsequently, according to the defined similarity, the K-means clustering algorithm divides the historical data into several clusters and identifies similar sample sets that have characteristics that are similar to the forecast day. Finally, after the ELM neural network model establishes the training and testing data, the DO is predicted using the similar sample set and the real-time environmental factors of the forecast days as input data. The prediction efficiency of our model was compared to that of others in terms of the mean absolute percentage error and the mean square error. The experimental results showed that our approach had higher forecasting accuracy and faster computation speed, which is beneficial for water management.",https://doi.org/10.13031/aea.11786,10.13031/aea.11786,"Huan, J.; Cao, W.

The SPPs are bias-corrected before being used as inputs to the hydrologic models, and model calibration is carried out independently for each of the model-product combinations (MPCs). Forecasts generated from the calibrated models are further bias-corrected to compensate for the deficiencies within the models, and then probabilistically merged using a variety of model averaging techniques. Use of bias-corrected SPPs in streamflow forecasting applications can overcome several issues associated with sparsely gauged basins and enable robust forecasting capabilities. Bias correction of streamflow significantly improves the forecasts in terms of accuracy and precision for all different cases considered. Results show that the merging of individual forecasts from different MPCs provides additional improvements. All the merging techniques applied in this study produce similar results, however, the Inverse Weighted Averaging (IVA) proves to be slightly superior in most cases. We demonstrate the implementation of the MMSF platform for real-time streamflow monitoring and forecasting in the Mara River basin of Africa (Kenya & Tanzania) in order to provide improved monitoring and forecasting tools to inform water management decisions.",https://doi.org/10.1002/2016WR019752,10.1002/2016WR019752,"Roy, Tirthankar; Serrat-Capdevila, Aleix; Gupta, Hoshin; Valdes, Juan",WATER RESOURCES RESEARCH,streamflow forecasting; satellite precipitation products; bias correction; model averaging; uncertainty analysis; real-time monitoring; MMSF,SATELLITE PRECIPITATION DATA; HYDROLOGIC MODEL; BIAS-CORRECTION; MAXIMUM-LIKELIHOOD; ROUTING MODEL; ANALYSIS TMPA; MARA RIVER; RAINFALL; PRODUCTS; ERROR,,AMER GEOPHYSICAL UNION,WASHINGTON,"2000 FLORIDA AVE NW, WASHINGTON, DC 20009 USA",0043-1397,1944-7973,,WATER RESOUR RES,Water Resour.

499,REAL-TIME PREDICTION OF SALINITY IN THE MEKONG RIVER DELTA,"A one dimensional numerical model is developed for real-time prediction of salinity, flow and water level for the Mekong River Delta (MRD) based on extensions of an existing MIKE 11 model for the region. The model extensions are based on the analysis of the system dynamics and available data for model boundary forcing including upstream river flow and seaward forcing of tides and salinity. The model is validated with measured water level and salinity for a dry season from January to June 2009. The real-time simulation system is fully automated via a Window service which runs daily to pre- and post-process data automatically including downloading online forecasts, generating model input, launching the real-time simulation and extracting model results. Model results of 7-day forecasts for salinity, flow and water level can be accessed online through a WebGIS interface which allows users to visualize the outputs as an overlay map layer at a certain snapshot or a time series plot at a computational node. The system can be used for monitoring flow and salinity intrusion in the rivers and it can also be used as a decision support system to mitigate negative effects of freshwater shortage and salinity intrusion in MRD",https://doi.org/10.1007/978-981-15-0291-0_197,10.1007/978-981-15-0291-0_197,Nghiem Tien Lam,"PROCEEDINGS OF THE 10TH INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE ON ASIAN AND PACIFIC COASTS, APAC 2019",salinity intrusion; salinity prediction; real-time simulation; Mekong Delta,,,SPRINGER-VERLAG SINGAPORE PTE LTD,SINGAPORE,"152 BEACH ROAD, #21-01/04 GATEWAY EAST, SINGAPORE, 189721, SINGAPORE",,,978-981-15-0291-0; 978-981-15-0290-3,,,,2020,,,1461,1468,,
500,Projection of temperature change and extreme temperature events in the Lancang-Mekong River basin,"The Lancang-Mekong River basin (LMRB) is under increasing threat from global warming. In this paper, the projection of future climate in the LMRB is explored by focusing on the temperature change and extreme temperature events. First, the authors evaluate the bias of temperature simulated by the Weather Research and Forecasting model. Then, correction is made for the simulation by comparing with observation based on the non-parametric quantile mapping using robust empirical quantiles (RQUANT) method. Furthermore, using the corrected model results, the future climate projections of temperature and extreme temperature events in this basin during 2016-35, 2046-65, and 2080-99 are analyzed. The study shows that RQUANT can effectively reduce the bias of simulation results. After correction, the simulation can capture the spatial features and trends of mean temperature over the LMRB, as well as the extreme temperature events. Besides, it can reproduce the spatial and temporal distributions of the major modes. In the future, the temperature will keep increasing, and the warming in the southern basin will be more intense in the wet season than the dry season. The number of extreme high-temperature days exhibits an increasing trend, while the number of extreme low-temperature days shows a decreasing trend. Based on empirical orthogonal function analysis, the dominant feature of temperature over this basin shows a consistent change. The second mode shows a seesaw pattern.",https://doi.org/10.1080/16742834.2020.1696143,10.1080/16742834.2020.1696143,Sun Chang; Xiao Ziniu; Sun Jianqi; Yu Entao,ATMOSPHERIC AND OCEANIC SCIENCE LETTERS,Climate projection; Lancang-Mekong River basin; model evaluation; bias correction; extreme temperature events,CLIMATE-CHANGE; SIMULATION,,KEAI PUBLISHING LTD,BEIJING,"16 DONGHUANGCHENGGEN NORTH ST, BEIJING, DONGHENG DISTRICT 100717, PEOPLES R CHINA",1674-2834,2376-6123,,ATMOS OCEAN SCI LETT,Atmos.

501,How does the calibration method impact the performance of the air2water model for the forecasting of lake surface water temperatures?,"The air2water model is a widely used tool for the forecasting of lake water temperatures and projection of climate change. It has been applied in thousands of lakes worldwide. However, it employed the Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) as the calibration method, which was proposed more than 20 years ago. In this study, 12 advanced optimization algorithms proposed during the recent few years were implemented to calibrate and validate the air2water model. Daily observed water temperature in temperate lakes (22 lowland lakes in Poland) were used to evaluate the model performance. Each optimizer was run 30 times with 3 different settings of the maximum number of function calls, 5000, 20,000, and 100,000. We have found that the PSO method used in the original air2water model performs relatively poor compared with most of the recent algorithms, and the majority of recently proposed algorithms reach the similar best solutions on many lakes when the highest number of function calls is allowed. However, only the HARD-DE (hierarchical archive-based mutation strategy with depth information of differential evolution) algorithm is never outperformed by any competitor, irrespective which lake and maximum number of function calls is considered. As a result, we highly recommend using HARD-DE as the calibration method for the air2water model in the future studies.",https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jhydrol.2021.126219,10.1016/j.jhydrol.2021.126219,"Zhu, Senlin; Piotrowski, Adam P.; Ptak, Mariusz; Napiorkowski, Jaroslaw J.; Dai, Jiangyu; Ji, Qingfeng",JOURNAL OF HYDROLOGY,Water temperature; Lake; air2water; Calibration algorithm; PSO; HARD-DE,PARTICLE SWARM OPTIMIZATION; DIFFERENTIAL EVOLUTION; CLIMATE-CHANGE; STRUCTURAL BIAS; AIR-TEMPERATURE; METAHEURISTICS; ALGORITHMS; DEPENDENCE; RESPONSES; ENSEMBLE,,ELSEVIER,AMSTERDAM,"RADARWEG 29, 1043 NX AMSTERDAM, NETHERLANDS",0022-1694,1879-2707,,J HYDROL,J.

502,Probabilistic landslide ensemble prediction systems: lessons to be learned from hydrology,"Landslide forecasting and early warning has a long tradition in landslide research and is primarily carried out based on empirical and statistical approaches, e.g., landslide-triggering rainfall thresholds. In the last decade, flood forecasting started the operational mode of so-called ensemble prediction systems following the success of the use of ensembles for weather forecasting. These probabilistic approaches acknowledge the presence of unavoidable variability and uncertainty when larger areas are considered and explicitly introduce them into the model results. Now that highly detailed numerical weather predictions and high-performance computing are becoming more common, physically based landslide forecasting for larger areas is becoming feasible, and the landslide research community could benefit from the experiences that have been reported from flood forecasting using ensemble predictions. This paper reviews and summarizes concepts of ensemble prediction in hydrology and discusses how these could facilitate improved landslide forecasting. In addition, a prototype landslide forecasting system utilizing the physically based TRIGRS (Transient Rainfall Infiltration and Grid-Based Regional Slope-Stability) model is presented to highlight how such forecasting systems could be implemented. The paper concludes with a discussion of challenges related to parameter variability and uncertainty, calibration and validation, and computational concerns.",https://doi.org/10.5194/nhess-18-2183-2018,10.5194/nhess-18-2183-2018,"Canli, Ekrem; Mergili, Martin; Thiebes, Benni; Glade, Thomas",NATURAL HAZARDS AND EARTH SYSTEM SCIENCES,,RAINFALL-INDUCED LANDSLIDES; NUMERICAL WEATHER PREDICTION; EARLY WARNING SYSTEMS; INDUCED SHALLOW LANDSLIDES; SLOPE STABILITY; SPATIAL VARIABILITY; DATA ASSIMILATION; REGIONAL-SCALE; LOGISTIC-REGRESSION; FLOOD FORECAST,,COPERNICUS GESELLSCHAFT MBH,GOTTINGEN,"BAHNHOFSALLEE 1E, GOTTINGEN, 37081, GERMANY",1561-8633,,,NAT HAZARD EARTH SYS,Nat.

504,"Stream Flow Forecasting of Poorly Gauged Mountainous Watershed by Least Square Support Vector Machine, Fuzzy Genetic Algorithm and M5 Model Tree Using Climatic Data from Nearby Station","Forecasting stream flow is a very importance issue in water resources planning and management. The ability of three soft computing methods, least square support vector machine (LSSVM), fuzzy genetic algorithm (FGA) and M5 model tree (M5T), in forecasting daily and monthly stream flows of poorly gauged mountainous watershed using nearby hydro-meteorological data is investigated in the current study. In the first application, monthly stream flows of Hunza river are forecasted using local stream flow data of Hunza and precipitation and temperature data of nearby station. LSSVM provides slightly better forecasts than the FGA and M5T models. Stream flow and temperature inputs generally give better forecasts compared to other inputs. In the second application, daily stream flows of Hunza river are forecasted using local stream flow data of Hunza and precipitation and temperature data of nearby station. Better results are obtained from the models comprising only stream flow inputs. In general, a better accuracy is obtained from LSSVM models in relative to the FGA and M5T. The results indicate that the monthly and daily stream flows of Hunza can be accurately forecasted by using only nearby climatic data. In the third application, daily stream flows of Hunza river are forecasted using local stream flow and climatic data and the models' accuracy is slightly increased in relative to the previous applications. LSSVM generally performs superior to the FGA and M5T in forecasting daily stream flow of Hunza river using local stream flow and climatic inputs.",https://doi.org/10.1007/s11269-018-2033-2,10.1007/s11269-018-2033-2,"Adnan, Rana Muhammad; Yuan, Xiaohui; Kisi, Ozgur; Adnan, Muhammad; Mehmood, Asif",WATER RESOURCES MANAGEMENT,Fuzzy logic approach; Genetic algorithm; Least square support vector machine; M5 model tree; Streamflow forecasting,REFERENCE EVAPOTRANSPIRATION; NEURAL-NETWORKS; PREDICTION,,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0920-4741,1573-1650,,WATER RESOUR MANAG,Water Resour.

505,EEMD and VMD based hybrid GPR models for river streamflow point and interval predictions,"Reliable river streamflow (RSF) forecasting is an important issue due to its impact on planning and operation of the water resources system. In this study, based on Lower Upper Bound Estimation (LUBE), hybrid artificial intelligence methods were used for point and interval prediction of monthly RSF. Two states based on stations own data and upstream stations data were considered for RSF modeling of Housatonic River during the period of 1941-2018. Ensemble Empirical Mode Decomposition (EEMD) and Variational Mode Decomposition (VMD) methods were used for enhancing the streamflow point forecasting accuracy. Interval Prediction (PI) was applied for tolerating increased uncertainty. Results showed that in the state 1, the error criterion value for the superior model decreased from 0.155 to 0.082 and 0.09 for the EEMD- and VMD-based models, respectively. Generally, hybrid models increased the modeling accuracy between 20 and 40%. Via the integrated approaches, the upstream stations data was successfully used for streamflow prediction of stations without data. In this state, the PI coverage probability values for the VMD-based model were approximately 12% higher than the single model. Generally, the VMD-based model led to more desirable results due to having higher PI coverage probability and lower mean PI width values. HIGHLIGHTS AI methods were applied to model the RSF in successive hydrometric stations. To obtain a model with higher efficiency EEMD and VMD techniques were applied. Interval prediction was applied for providing more details for practical operation decisions.",https://doi.org/10.2166/ws.2021.151,10.2166/ws.2021.151,"Ghasempour, Roghayeh; Azamathulla, Hazi Mohammad; Roushangar, Kiyoumars",WATER SUPPLY,interval prediction; lower upper bound estimation; streamflow; successive points; variational mode decomposition,EXTREME LEARNING-MACHINE; SUPPORT VECTOR MACHINE; GAUSSIAN-PROCESSES; DECOMPOSITION; AREA,,IWA PUBLISHING,LONDON,"REPUBLIC-EXPORT BLDG, UNITS 1 04 & 1 05, 1 CLOVE CRESCENT, LONDON, ENGLAND",1606-9749,1607-0798,,WATER SUPPLY,Water Supply,NOV,2021,21,7,3960,3975,,
506,"One Health concepts and challenges for surveillance, forecasting, and mitigation of plant disease beyond the traditional scope of crop production","The One Health approach to understanding disease epidemiology and achieving surveillance and prevention is holistic, while focusing on zoonotic diseases. Many of its principles are similar to those espoused in agroecology, begetting the question of what One Health can contribute-in practice-to preventing plant disease. Here we describe four knowledge challenges for plant health management that have arisen from the One Health experience for zoonotic diseases that could boost prospects for novel approaches to plant disease surveillance, prediction, and prevention. The challenges are to (a) uncover reservoirs and revise pathogen life histories, (b) elucidate drivers of virulence beyond the context of direct host-pathogen interactions, (c) account for the natural highways of long-distance dissemination (i.e., surface water and air mass movement), and (d) update disease forecasts in the face of changing land use, cultivation practices, and climate. Furthermore, we note that implementation of a One Health approach to disease surveillance and prevention will require mobilization of tools to deal with the representation and accessibility of massive and heterogeneous data and knowledge; with knowledge inference, data science, modelling, and pattern recognition; and multi-actor approaches that unite different sectors of society as well as different scientific disciplines.

507,Maximum Entropy Modeling to Predict the Impact of Climate Change on Pine Wilt Disease in China,"Pine wilt disease is a devastating forest disease caused by the pinewood nematode Bursaphelenchus xylophilus, which has been listed as the object of quarantine in China. Climate change influences species and may exacerbate the risk of forest diseases, such as the pine wilt disease. The maximum entropy (MaxEnt) model was used in this study to identify the current and potential distribution and habitat suitability of three pine species and B. xylophilus in China. Further, the potential distribution was modeled using the current (1970-2000) and the projected (2050 and 2070) climate data based on two representative concentration pathways (RCP 2.6 and RCP 8.5), and fairly robust prediction results were obtained. Our model identified that the area south of the Yangtze River in China was the most severely affected place by pine wilt disease, and the eastern foothills of the Tibetan Plateau acted as a geographical barrier to pest distribution. Bioclimatic variables related to temperature influenced pine trees' distribution, while those related to precipitation affected B. xylophilus's distribution. In the future, the suitable area of B. xylophilus will continue to increase; the shifts in the center of gravity of the suitable habitats of the three pine species and B. xylophilus will be different under climate change. The area ideal for pine trees will migrate slightly northward under RCP 8.5. The pine species will continue to face B. xylophilus threat in 2050 and 2070 under the two distinct climate change scenarios. Therefore, we should plan appropriate measures to prevent its expansion. Predicting the distribution of pine species and the impact of climate change on forest diseases is critical for controlling the pests according to local conditions. Thus, the MaxEnt model proposed in this study can be potentially used to forecast the species distribution and disease risks and provide guidance for the timely prevention and management of B. xylophilus.",https://doi.org/10.3389/fpls.2021.652500,10.3389/fpls.2021.652500,"Tang, Xinggang; Yuan, Yingdan; Li, Xiangming; Zhang, Jinchi",FRONTIERS IN PLANT SCIENCE,climate change; pine wilt disease; species distribution model; risk prediction; pine species,,,FRONTIERS MEDIA SA,LAUSANNE,"AVENUE DU TRIBUNAL FEDERAL 34, LAUSANNE, CH-1015, SWITZERLAND",1664-462X,,,FRONT PLANT SCI,Front.

508,Forecast of streamflows to the Arctic Ocean by a Bayesian neural network model with snowcover and climate inputs,"Increasing water flowing into the Arctic Ocean affects oceanic freshwater balance, which may lead to the thermohaline circulation collapse and unpredictable climatic conditions if freshwater inputs continue to increase. Despite the crucial role of ocean inflow in the climate system, less is known about its predictability, variability, and connectivity to cryospheric and climatic patterns on different time scales. In this study, multi-scale variation modes were decomposed from observed daily and monthly snowcover and river flows to improve the predictability of Arctic Ocean inflows from the Mackenzie River Basin in Canada. Two multi-linear regression and Bayesian neural network models were used with different combinations of remotely sensed snowcover, in-situ inflow observations, and climatic teleconnection patterns as predictors. The results showed that daily and monthly ocean inflows are associated positively with decadal snowcover fluctuations and negatively with interannual snowcover fluctuations. Interannual snowcover and antecedent flow oscillations have a more important role in describing the variability of ocean inflows than seasonal snowmelt and large-scale climatic teleconnection. Both models forecasted inflows seven months in advance with a Nash-Sutcliffe efficiency score of approximate to 0.8. The proposed methodology can be used to assess the variability of the freshwater input to northern oceans, affecting thermohaline and atmospheric circulations.",https://doi.org/10.2166/nh.2020.164,10.2166/nh.2020.164,"Rasouli, Kabir; Nasri, Bouchra R.; Soleymani, Armina; Mahmood, Taufique H.; Hori, Masahiro; Haghighi, Ali Torabi",HYDROLOGY RESEARCH,Arctic ocean; Bayesian neural network; climate teleconnections; Mackenzie River Basin; snowcover extent; streamflow forecast,MACKENZIE RIVER-BASIN; SENSED SNOW-COVER; INTERANNUAL VARIABILITY; LAKE ATHABASCA; TRENDS; CANADA; SENSITIVITY; INTERRELATIONSHIPS; TEMPERATURES; FREQUENCY,,IWA PUBLISHING,LONDON,"ALLIANCE HOUSE, 12 CAXTON ST, LONDON SW1H0QS, ENGLAND",1998-9563,2224-7955,,HYDROL RES,Hydrol.

509,Ensemble flash flood predictions using a high-resolution nationwide distributed rainfall-runoff model: case study of the heavy rain event of July 2018 and Typhoon Hagibis in 2019,"The heavy rain event of July 2018 and Typhoon Hagibis in October 2019 caused severe flash flood disasters in numerous parts of western and eastern Japan. Flash floods need to be predicted over a wide range with long forecasting lead time for effective evacuation. The predictability of flash floods caused by the two extreme events is investigated by using a high-resolution (similar to 150 m) nationwide distributed rainfall-runoff model forced by ensemble precipitation forecasts with 39 h lead time. Results of the deterministic simulation at nowcasting mode with radar and gauge composite rainfall could reasonably simulate the storm runoff hydrographs at many dam reservoirs over western Japan for the case of heavy rainfall in 2018 (F18) with the default parameter setting. For the case of Typhoon Hagibis in 2019 (T19), a similar performance was obtained by incorporating unsaturated flow effect in the model applied to Kanto Region. The performance of the ensemble forecast was evaluated based on the bias ratios and the relative operating characteristic curves, which suggested the higher predictability in peak runoff for T19. For the F18, the uncertainty arises due to the difficulty in accurately forecasting the storm positions by the frontal zone; as a result, the actual distribution of the peak runoff could not be well forecasted. Overall, this study showed that the predictability of flash floods was different between the two extreme events. The ensemble spreads contain quantitative information of predictive uncertainty, which can be utilized for the decision making of emergency responses against flash floods.",https://doi.org/10.1186/s40645-020-00391-7,10.1186/s40645-020-00391-7,"Sayama, Takahiro; Yamada, Masafumi; Sugawara, Yoshito; Yamazaki, Dai",PROGRESS IN EARTH AND PLANETARY SCIENCE,Ensemble forecasting; Flash floods; Rainfall-runoff-inundation model; Typhoon Hagibis; Uncertainty; Flood forecasting; Quantitative precipitation forecasting; Saturated subsurface flow; Distributed hydrological model; Meso-scale Ensemble Prediction System (MEPS),STREAMFLOW FORECASTS; PAKISTAN FLOOD; ALERT SYSTEM; PART; JAPAN; PRECIPITATION; VERIFICATION; TEMPERATURE; SIMULATION; DESIGN,,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"ONE NEW YORK PLAZA, SUITE 4600, NEW YORK, NY, UNITED STATES",2197-4284,,,PROG EARTH PLANET SC,Prog.

We tested our approach on 102 groundwater wells in different climatic regions and aquifers of the United States that are part of the U.S. Geological Survey Groundwater Climate Response Network. We evaluated the importance of current groundwater levels, precipitation, streamflow, seasonal variability, Palmer Drought Severity Index, and atmosphere/ocean indices for developing the logistic regression equations. Several diagnostics of model fit were used to evaluate the regression equations, including testing of autocorrelation of residuals, goodness-of-fit metrics, and bootstrap validation testing. The probabilistic predictions were most successful at wells with high persistence (low month-to-month variability) in their groundwater records and at wells where the groundwater level remained below the defined low threshold for sustained periods (generally three months or longer). The model fit was weakest at wells with strong seasonal variability in levels and with shorter duration low-threshold events. We identified challenges in deriving probabilistic-forecasting models and possible approaches for addressing those challenges.",https://doi.org/10.1111/1752-1688.12582,10.1111/1752-1688.12582,"Dudley, Robert W.; Hodgkins, Glenn A.; Dickinson, Jesse E.",JOURNAL OF THE AMERICAN WATER RESOURCES ASSOCIATION,groundwater hydrology; groundwater management; statistics; time series analysis; wells,DROUGHT SEVERITY INDEX; HYDROLOGIC TIME-SERIES; CLIMATIC VARIABILITY; PRECIPITATION; RIVER; OSCILLATION; STREAMFLOW; AQUIFER; SURFACE; ENSO,,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",1093-474X,1752-1688,,J AM WATER RESOUR AS,J.

511,Ranking stressor impacts on periphyton structure and function with mesocosm experiments and environmental-change forecasts,"Streams are being subjected to physical, chemical, and biological stresses stemming from both natural and anthropogenic changes to the planet. In the face of limited time and resources, scientists, resource managers, and policy makers need ways to rank stressors and their impacts so that we can prioritize them from the most to least important (i.e., perform 'ecological triage'). We report results from an experiment in which we established a periphyton community from the Huron River (Michigan, USA) in 84 experimental 'flumes' (stream mesocosms). We then dosed the flumes with gradients of six common stressors (increased temperature, taxa extinctions, sedimentation, nitrogen, phosphorus, and road salt) and monitored periphyton structure and function. A set of a priori deterministic functions were fit to each stressor-endpoint response and model averaging based on AICc weights was used to develop concentration-response best-fit predictions. Model predictions from different stressors were then compared to forecasts of future environmental change to rank stressors according to the potential magnitude of impacts. All of the stressors studied altered at least one characteristic of the periphyton; however, the extent (i.e., structural and functional changes) and magnitude of effects expected under future forecasts differed significantly among stressors. Elevated nitrogen concentrations are projected to have the greatest combined effect on stream periphyton structure and function. Extinction, sediment, and phosphorus all had similar but less substantial impact on the periphyton (e.g., affected only structure not function, smaller magnitude change). Elevated temperature and salt both had measurable effects on periphyton, but their overall impacts were much lower than any of the other stressors. For periphyton in the Huron River, our results suggest that, among the stressors examined, increased N pollution may have the greatest potential to alter the structure and function of the periphyton community, and managers should prioritize reducing anthropogenic sources of nitrogen. Our study demonstrates an experimental approach to ecological triage that can be used as an additional line of evidence to prioritize management decisions for specific ecosystems in the face of ecological change.",https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0204510,10.1371/journal.pone.0204510,"Costello, David M.; Kulacki, Konrad J.; McCarthy, Mary E.; Tiegs, Scott D.; Cardinale, Bradley J.",PLOS ONE,,MULTIPLE STRESSORS; RISK-ASSESSMENT; AUTOTROPHIC BIOMASS; AQUATIC ECOSYSTEMS; STREAM ECOSYSTEMS; CLIMATE-CHANGE; UNITED-STATES; FRESH-WATER; BIODIVERSITY; RESPONSES,,PUBLIC LIBRARY SCIENCE,SAN FRANCISCO,"1160 BATTERY STREET, STE 100, SAN FRANCISCO, CA 94111 USA",1932-6203,,,PLOS ONE,PLoS One,SEP 24,2018,13,9,,,e0204510,
512,Predicting the economic impacts of the 2017 West Coast salmon troll ocean fishery closure,"The ocean salmon fishery on the US West Coast has faced periodic closures of varying extents in order to protect vulnerable runs. These closures can have serious consequences for fishers and fishing communities, and have necessitated the release of millions of dollars of federal disaster aid. The 2017 ocean Chinook troll fishery (the major salmon ocean fishery) is closed between southern Oregon and northern California to protect the Klamath River fall Chinook, which is forecast to return in low numbers. A model of vessel fishing choices was used in combination with an established input-output model to estimate the potential economic impact of this closure on fishers and fishing communities. The analysis predicts that this closure of the ocean fishery will result in a loss of $5.8-$8.9 million in income, $12.8-$19.6 million in sales, and 200-330 jobs. These estimates are only a partial estimate of the economic impacts of the 2017 salmon regulations, as they do not fully account for the effects of the limited season outside of the closed ocean area or the effects on other salmon fisheries (e.g. the gillnet and recreational fisheries). The impacts are not distributed evenly in space, with the largest relative losses occurring in the Coos Bay, Brookings, and Eureka regions. This information may be useful as policymakers consider mitigating economic losses in the fishery and associated communities. Early estimates of economic impacts of fishery closures may also enable quicker determination of the need and extent of disaster assistance and a more timely response.",https://doi.org/10.1016/j.marpol.2018.03.005,10.1016/j.marpol.2018.03.005,"Richerson, Kate; Leonard, Jerry; Holland, Daniel S.",MARINE POLICY,Salmon fishery; California Current; Fishery disaster; Fishery closure; Economic impacts; Fishing behavior; Input-output model,BEHAVIOR,,ELSEVIER SCI LTD,OXFORD,"THE BOULEVARD, LANGFORD LANE, KIDLINGTON, OXFORD OX5 1GB, OXON, ENGLAND",0308-597X,1872-9460,,MAR POLICY,Mar.

513,Comparison of hybrid models for daily streamflow prediction in a forested basin,"Accurate forecasting of daily streamflow is essential for water resource planning and management. As a typical non-stationary time series, it is difficult to avoid the effects of noise in the hydrological data. In this study, the wavelet threshold de-noising method was applied to pre-process daily flow data from a small forested basin. The key factors influencing the de-noising results, such as the mother wavelet type, decomposition level, and threshold functions, were examined and determined according to the signal to noise ratio and mean square error. Then, three mathematical techniques, including an optimized back-propagation neural network (BPNN), optimized support vector regression (SVR), and adaptive neuro-fuzzy inference system (ANFIS), were used to predict the daily streamflow based on raw data and wavelet de-noising data. The performance of the three models indicated that a wavelet de-noised time series could improve the forecasting accuracy. The SVR showed a better overall performance than BPNN and ANFIS during both the training and validating periods. However, the estimation of low flow and peak flow indicated that ANFIS performed best in the prediction of low flow and that SVR was slightly superior to the others for forecasting peak flow.",https://doi.org/10.2166/hydro.2017.189,10.2166/hydro.2017.189,"Li, Xue; Sha, Jian; Li, You-meng; Wang, Zhong-Liang",JOURNAL OF HYDROINFORMATICS,adaptive neuro fuzzy inference system; artificial neural network; daily flow forecasting discrete wavelet transform; support vector regression,ARTIFICIAL NEURAL-NETWORK; SUPPORT VECTOR MACHINE; FUZZY INFERENCE SYSTEM; TIME-SERIES; LYAPUNOV EXPONENTS; REGRESSION-MODEL; OPTIMIZATION; HYDROLOGY; DIMENSION; LEVEL,,IWA PUBLISHING,LONDON,"ALLIANCE HOUSE, 12 CAXTON ST, LONDON SW1H0QS, ENGLAND",1464-7141,1465-1734,,J HYDROINFORM,J.

514,Seasonal streamflow forecasts for Europe - Part 2: Sources of skill,"This paper uses hindcasts (1981-2010) to investigate the sources of skill in seasonal hydrological forecasts for Europe. The hindcasts were produced with WUSHP (Wageningen University Seamless Hydrological Prediction system). Skill was identified in a companion paper. In WUSHP, hydrological processes are simulated by running the Variable Infiltration Capacity (VIC) hydrological model forced with an ensemble of bias-corrected output from the seasonal forecast system 4 (S4) of the European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts (ECMWF). We first analysed the meteorological forcing. The precipitation forecasts contain considerable skill for the first lead month but hardly any significant skill at longer lead times. Seasonal forecasts of temperature have more skill. Skill in summer temperature is related to climate change and is more or less independent of lead time. Skill in February and March is unrelated to climate change. Different sources of skill in hydro-meteorological variables were isolated with a suite of specific hydrological hindcasts akin to ensemble streamflow prediction (ESP). These hindcasts show that in Europe, initial conditions of soil moisture (SM) form the dominant source of skill in run-off. From April to July, initial conditions of snow contribute significantly to the skill. Some remarkable skill features are due to indirect effects, i.e. skill due to forcing or initial conditions of snow and soil moisture at an earlier stage is stored in the hydrological state (snow and/or soil moisture) of a later stage, which then contributes to persistence of skill. Skill in evapotranspiration (ET) originates mostly in the meteorological forcing. For run-off we also compared the full hindcasts (with S4 forcing) with two types of ESP (or ESP-like) hindcasts (with identical forcing for all years). Beyond the second lead month, the full hindcasts are less skilful than the ESP (or ESP-like) hindcasts, because inter-annual variations in the S4 forcing consist mainly of noise which enhances degradation of the skill.",https://doi.org/10.5194/hess-23-371-2019,10.5194/hess-23-371-2019,"Greuell, Wouter; Franssen, Wietse H.

515,Forecasting distributions of an aquatic invasive species (Nitellopsis obtusa) under future climate scenarios,"Starry stonewort (Nitellopsis obtusa) is an alga that has emerged as an aquatic invasive species of concern in the United States. Where established, starry stonewort can interfere with recreational uses of water bodies and potentially have ecological impacts. Incipient invasion of starry stonewort in Minnesota provides an opportunity to predict future expansion in order to target early detection and strategic management. We used ecological niche models to identify suitable areas for starry stonewort in Minnesota based on global occurrence records and present-day and future climate conditions. We assessed sensitivity of forecasts to different parameters, using four emission scenarios (i.e., RCP 2.6, RCP 4.5, RCP 6, and RCP 8.5) from five future climate models (i.e., CCSM, GISS, IPSL, MIROC, and MRI). From our niche model analyses, we found that (i) occurrences from the entire range, instead of occurrences restricted to the invaded range, provide more informed models; (ii) default settings in Maxent did not provide the best model; (iii) the model calibration area and its background samples impact model performance; (iv) model projections to future climate conditions should be restricted to analogous environments; and (v) forecasts in future climate conditions should include different future climate models and model calibration areas to better capture uncertainty in forecasts. Under present climate, the most suitable areas for starry stonewort are predicted to be found in central and southeastern Minnesota. In the future, suitable areas for starry stonewort are predicted to shift in geographic range under some future climate models and to shrink under others, with most permutations indicating a net decrease of the species' suitable range. Our suitability maps can serve to design shortterm plans for surveillance and education, while future climate models suggest a plausible reduction of starry stonewort spread in the long-term if the trends in climate warming remain.",https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0180930,10.1371/journal.pone.0180930,"Romero-Alvarez, Daniel; Escobar, Luis E.; Varela, Sara; Larkin, Daniel J.; Phelps, Nicholas B.

516,Improved Drought Prediction Using Near Real-Time Climate Forecasts and Simulated Hydrologic Conditions,"Short-term drought forecasting is helpful for establishing drought mitigation plans and for managing risks that often ensue in water resource systems. Additionally, hydrologic modeling using high-resolution spatial and temporal data is used to simulate the land surface water and energy fluxes, including runoff, baseflow, and soil moisture, which are useful for drought forecasting. In this study, the Soil and Water Assessment Tool (SWAT) and Variable Infiltration Capacity (VIC) models are used for short-term drought forecasting in the contiguous United States (CONUS), as many areas in this region are frequently affected by varying drought intensities. Weekly-to-seasonal meteorological inputs are provided by the Climate Prediction Center (CPC) for the retrospective period (January 2012 to July 2017) and Climate Forecasting System version 2 (CFS v2) for the forecasting period (August 2017 to April 2018), and these inputs are used to estimate agricultural and groundwater drought conditions. For drought assessment, three drought indices, namely, the Standardized Soil Moisture index (SSI), the Multivariate Standardized Drought Index (MSDI), and the Standardized Baseflow index (SBI), were analyzed. The accuracy of the forecasting results was verified using several a performance measure (Drought area agreement (%); DA). Generally, eight weeks of lead time forecasting showed good drought predictability from both the SWAT and VIC models for the MSDI simulations (62% for SWAT and 64% for VIC for all drought categories). However, the DA values for eight weeks lead time forecasting for SSI were 23% (SWAT) and 10% (VIC) and 7% (SWAT) and 7% (VIC) for the SBI, respectively. In addition, the accuracies of drought predictions remarkably decreased after eight weeks, and the average DA values were 36% for SWAT and 38% for VIC due to an increase in the uncertainties associated with meteorological variables in CFS v2 products. For example, there are increases in the total number of grids where the absolute values of monthly differences between CFSv2 and CPC observations exceed 20 mm and 1 degrees C during the forecasting period. Additionally, drought forecasting using only one variable (i.e., SSI and SBI) showed low prediction performances even for the first eight weeks. The results of this study provide insights into drought forecasting methods and provide a better understanding to plan for timely water resource management decisions.",https://doi.org/10.3390/su10061799,10.3390/su10061799,"Kang, Hyunwoo; Sridhar, Venkataramana",SUSTAINABILITY,drought forecasting; hydrologic models (SWAT and VIC); CFSv2; SSI; MSDI,SOIL-MOISTURE INDEX; RIVER-BASIN; AGRICULTURAL DROUGHT; PROBABILISTIC DROUGHT; CALIFORNIA DROUGHT; WATER-RESOURCES; PRECIPITATION; MODEL; FRAMEWORK; PREDICTABILITY,,MDPI,BASEL,"ST ALBAN-ANLAGE 66, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND",,2071-1050,,SUSTAINABILITY-BASEL,Sustainability,JUN,2018,10,6,,,1799,
517,Scenario approach for the seasonal forecast of Kharif flows from the Upper Indus Basin,"Snow and glacial melt runoff are the major sources of water contribution from the high mountainous terrain of the Indus River upstream of the Tarbela reservoir. A reliable forecast of seasonal water availability for the Kharif cropping season (April-September) can pave the way towards better water management and a subsequent boost in the agro-economy of Pakistan. The use of degree-day models in conjunction with satellite-based remote-sensing data for the forecasting of seasonal snow and ice melt runoff has proved to be a suitable approach for data-scarce regions. In the present research, the Snowmelt Runoff Model (SRM) has not only been enhanced by incorporating the glacier (G) component but also applied for the forecast of seasonal water availability from the Upper Indus Basin (UIB). Excelbased SRM + G takes account of separate degree-day factors for snow and glacier melt processes. All-year simulation runs with SRM + G for the period 2003-2014 result in an average flow component distribution of 53, 21, and 26% for snow, glacier, and rain, respectively. The UIB has been divided into Upper and Lower parts because of the different climatic conditions in the Tibetan Plateau. The scenario approach for seasonal forecasting, which like the Ensemble Streamflow Prediction method uses historic meteorology as model forcings, has proven to be adequate for long-term water availability forecasts. The accuracy of the forecast with a mean absolute percentage error (MAPE) of 9.5% could be slightly improved compared to two existing operational forecasts for the UIB, and the bias could be reduced to 2.0 %. However, the association between forecasts and observations as well as the skill in predicting extreme conditions is rather weak for all three models, which motivates further research on the selection of a subset of ensemble members according to forecasted seasonal anomalies.",https://doi.org/10.5194/hess-22-1391-2018,10.5194/hess-22-1391-2018,"Ismail, Muhammad Fraz; Bogacki, Wolfgang",HYDROLOGY AND EARTH SYSTEM SCIENCES,,SNOW COVER; RIVER-BASIN; PRECIPITATION; VERIFICATION; CLIMATE; MODEL; PREDICTION; HIMALAYA,,COPERNICUS GESELLSCHAFT MBH,GOTTINGEN,"BAHNHOFSALLEE 1E, GOTTINGEN, 37081, GERMANY",1027-5606,1607-7938,,HYDROL EARTH SYST SC,Hydrol.

However, the level of forecast accuracy is limited, since its performance depends on rainfall forecasting and hydrological model. In order to increase the efficiency of forecasting, this study introduces the inflow forecasting method that integrates the real-time updating techniques with continuous optimization method of MIKE NAM model to specify the appropriate parameter set for forecasting time. The proposed forecasting method was tested for the Ho Ho reservoir, the area facing the scarcity of historical data for model calibration and verification. The analysis of the forecasting results for Ho Ho reservoir using transferred parameters from the stable calibrated parameter values at Hoa Duyet station (downstream of Ho Ho reservoir) and the results obtained using the adapted parameters by the proposed method shows that the adapted parameter values provides a more reliable forecast, which will better serve the decision making.",https://doi.org/10.12911/22998993/85759,10.12911/22998993/85759,"Dang Dinh Kha; Nhu, Nguyen Y.; Tran Ngoc Anh",JOURNAL OF ECOLOGICAL ENGINEERING,real time updating; flood; forecasting; ungauged catchment,,,POLISH SOC ECOLOGICAL ENGINEERING,LUBLIN,"LUBLIN UNIV TECHNOLOGY, ENVIRONMENTAL ENGINEERING FAC, LUBLIN, 20618, POLAND",2299-8993,,,J ECOL ENG,J.

From these, the ones of greatest importance are those which endanger human settlements as well as socioeconomic activities. This is the case of Tamuin city, settled in the shore of Tampaon River, in Mexico. In this work, we performed a detailed numerical modelling of the hydrodynamics of the zone, considering in situ topographic and bathymetric data as well as hydrodynamic parameters. Severe rainfall scenarios were simulated in order to determine the zones which are prone to flooding, as well as the potential periods of time between the beginning of the rainfall up to the flooding, considering the potential effects of climate change in the precipitation rate. The outcome of this research will help local governments undertake preventive actions to reinforce the identified risky zones, thus providing an adequate protection of rural and urban zones, as well as their inhabitants and their economical activities from current and future floods, considering potential climate change effects.",https://doi.org/10.3390/w11091867,10.3390/w11091867,"Rodriguez-Cuevas, Clemente; Rocha-Escalante, Hermann; Couder-Castaneda, Carlos; Medina, Isaac; Hernandez-Gomez, Jorge J.",WATER,hydrodynamics; river; floods; flooding; inundation; climate change; global warming; numerical modelling; model,LOWER PANUCO BASIN; HUASTECA POTOSINA; ATLANTIC-OCEAN; CHANGE IMPACTS; WATER-QUALITY; VULNERABILITY; MANAGEMENT; STREAMFLOW; SEDIMENT; SYSTEM,,MDPI,BASEL,"ST ALBAN-ANLAGE 66, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND",,2073-4441,,WATER-SUI,Water,SEP,2019,11,9,,,1867,
520,Seasonal Forecasts of the Summer 2016 Yangtze River Basin Rainfall,"The Yangtze River has been subject to heavy flooding throughout history, and in recent times severe floods such as those in 1998 have resulted in heavy loss of life and livelihoods. Dams along the river help to manage flood waters, and are important sources of electricity for the region. Being able to forecast high-impact events at long lead times therefore has enormous potential benefit. Recent improvements in seasonal forecasting mean that dynamical climate models can start to be used directly for operational services. The teleconnection from El Nio to Yangtze River basin rainfall meant that the strong El Nio in winter 2015/16 provided a valuable opportunity to test the application of a dynamical forecast system. This paper therefore presents a case study of a real-time seasonal forecast for the Yangtze River basin, building on previous work demonstrating the retrospective skill of such a forecast. A simple forecasting methodology is presented, in which the forecast probabilities are derived from the historical relationship between hindcast and observations. Its performance for 2016 is discussed. The heavy rainfall in the May-June-July period was correctly forecast well in advance. August saw anomalously low rainfall, and the forecasts for the June-July-August period correctly showed closer to average levels. The forecasts contributed to the confidence of decision-makers across the Yangtze River basin. Trials of climate services such as this help to promote appropriate use of seasonal forecasts, and highlight areas for future improvements.",https://doi.org/10.1007/s00376-018-7210-y,10.1007/s00376-018-7210-y,"Bett, Philip E.; Scaife, Adam A.; Li, Chaofan; Hewitt, Chris; Golding, Nicola; Zhang, Peiqun; Dunstone, Nick; Smith, Doug M.; Thornton, Hazel E.; Lu, Riyu; Ren, Hong-Li",ADVANCES IN ATMOSPHERIC SCIENCES,seasonal forecasting; flood forecasting; Yangtze basin rainfall; ENSO; hydroelectricity,GLOBAL COUPLED MODEL; CHINA; PREDICTION; PRECIPITATION; CLIMATE; MONSOON; ENERGY; PREDICTABILITY; CONFIGURATION; JULES,,SCIENCE PRESS,BEIJING,"16 DONGHUANGCHENGGEN NORTH ST, BEIJING 100717, PEOPLES R CHINA",0256-1530,1861-9533,,ADV ATMOS SCI,Adv.

521,Annual Streamflow Time Series Prediction Using Extreme Learning Machine Based on Gravitational Search Algorithm and Variational Mode Decomposition,"Accurate annual runoff prediction plays an important role in modern water resources planning and management. Here, a hybrid model using evolutionary extreme learning machine and variational mode decomposition (VMD) is developed to forecast annual runoff time series. In the proposed method, the VMD method is first used to decompose the original streamflow into a series of disjoint subcomponents; second, each subcomponent is forecasted by constructing an appropriate extreme learning machine model while the gravitational search algorithm is adopted to tune the model parameters; finally, the aggregated output generated by the forecasting results of all the models is treated as the final simulated output. The annual runoff data series of three huge hydropower reservoirs in China are chosen to testify the performance of the proposed forecasting model. The results show that the developed model can outperform several traditional methods with respect to the employed statistical indexes. Thus, the decomposition-ensemble idea is helpful to yield accurate and stable forecasting results, while the proposed forecasting method can provide strong technical support for operators in water resources and power systems.",https://doi.org/10.1061/(ASCE)HE.1943-5584.0001902,10.1061/(ASCE)HE.1943-5584.0001902,"Niu, Wen-jing; Feng, Zhong-kai; Chen, Yu-bin; Zhang, Hai-rong; Cheng, Chun-tian",JOURNAL OF HYDROLOGIC ENGINEERING,Hydrological time series forecasting; Variational mode decomposition; Evolutionary extreme learning machine; Gravitational search algorithm; Decomposition and ensemble,ARTIFICIAL NEURAL-NETWORK; PARTICLE SWARM OPTIMIZATION; IMPROVING FORECASTING ACCURACY; RESERVOIR OPERATION; HYDROPOWER RESERVOIR; GLOBAL OPTIMIZATION; REGRESSION; UNCERTAINTY; MEMRISTOR,,ASCE-AMER SOC CIVIL ENGINEERS,RESTON,"1801 ALEXANDER BELL DR, RESTON, VA 20191-4400 USA",1084-0699,1943-5584,,J HYDROL ENG,J.

522,Hydrological modelling in the anthroposphere: predicting local runoff in a heavily modified high-alpine catchment,"Hydrological models within inflow forecasting systems for high-alpine hydropower reservoirs can provide valuable information as part of a decision support system for the improvement of hydropower production or flood retention. The information, especially concerning runoff, is however rarely available for the calibration of the hydrological models used. Therefore, a method is presented to derive local runoff from secondary information for the calibration of the model parameters of the rainfallrunoff model COSERO. Changes in water levels in reservoirs, reservoir outflows, discharge measurements at water intakes and in transport lines are thereby used to derive the local, natural flow for a given sub-catchment. The proposed method is applied within a research study for the A-BB Infrastructure Railsystem division in the Stubache catchment in the central Austrian Alps. Here, the A-BB operates the hydropower scheme Kraftwerksgruppe Stubachtal, which consists of 7 reservoirs and 4 hydropower stations. The hydrological model has been set up considering this human influences and the high natural heterogeneity in topography and land cover, including glaciers. Overall, the hydrological model performs mostly well for the catchment with highest NSE values of 0.78 for the calibration and 0.79 for the validation period, also considering the use of homogeneous parameter fields and the uncertainty of the derived local discharge values. The derived runoff data proved to be useful information for the model calibration. Further analysis, examining the water balance and its components as well as snow cover, showed satisfactory simulation results. In conclusion, a unique runoff dataset for a small scale high-alpine catchment has been created to establish a hydrological flow prediction model which in a further step can be used for improved and sustainable hydropower management.",https://doi.org/10.1007/s11629-017-4587-5,10.1007/s11629-017-4587-5,"Wesemann, Johannes; Herrnegger, Mathew; Schulz, Karsten",JOURNAL OF MOUNTAIN SCIENCE,High alpine catchments; Rainfall-runoff modelling; Hydropower; Ungauged basins,SNOW; PERFORMANCE; VALIDATION; STORAGE; CALIBRATION; INTEGRATION; DISCHARGE; DYNAMICS; BALANCE; SYSTEM,,SCIENCE PRESS,BEIJING,"16 DONGHUANGCHENGGEN NORTH ST, BEIJING 100717, PEOPLES R CHINA",1672-6316,1993-0321,,J MT SCI-ENGL,J Mt.

523,A deep learning approach for hydrological time-series prediction: A case study of Gilgit river basin,"Streamflow prediction is a significant undertaking for water resources planning and management. Accurate forecasting of streamflow always being a challenging task for the hydrologist due to its high stochasticity and dynamic patterns. Several traditional and the deep learning models have been applied to simulate the complex nature of the hydrological system. However, to develop and explore a better expert system for prediction is a continuous exertion for hydrological studies. In this study, a deep neural network, namely a one-dimensional convolutional neural network (1D-CNN) and extreme learning machine (ELM) are explored for one-step-ahead streamflow forecasting for three-time horizons (daily, weekly and monthly) in Gilgit River, Pakistan. The 1D-CNN model gained incredible popularity due to its state-of-the-art performance and nominal computational complexity; while ELM model performed superfast as compared to traditional/deep learning architecture, gives comparable performance with fast execution rate. A comparative analysis is presented to assess the performance of the 1D-CNN related to the ELM model. The performance measurement matrices defined as the correlation coefficient (R-2), mean absolute error (MAE) and root mean square error (RMSE) computed between the observed and predicted streamflow to evaluate the 1D-CNN and ELM model efficacy. The results indicated that the ELM model performed relatively better than the 1D-CNN model based on predefined statistical measures in three-time scale. In numerical terms, the superiority of ELM over 1D-CNN model was demonstrated by R-2 = 0.99, MAE = 18.8, RMSE = 50.14, and R-2 = 0.97, MAE = 136.59, RMSE = 230.9, for daily streamflow (testing phase) respectively. Based on our findings, it can be concluded that the ELM model would be an alternative to the 1D-CNN model for highly accurate streamflow forecasting in mountainous regions of the world.",https://doi.org/10.1007/s12145-020-00477-2,10.1007/s12145-020-00477-2,"Hussain, Dostdar; Hussain, Tahir; Khan, Aftab Ahmed; Naqvi, Syed Ali Asad; Jamil, Akhtar",EARTH SCIENCE INFORMATICS,Artificial Neural Network; 1D-Convolutional Neural Network; Extreme Learning Machine; Streamflow prediction; Gilgit River,SUPPORT VECTOR MACHINE; MODELS; STREAMFLOW; ALGORITHMS,,SPRINGER HEIDELBERG,HEIDELBERG,"TIERGARTENSTRASSE 17, D-69121 HEIDELBERG, GERMANY",1865-0473,1865-0481,,EARTH SCI INFORM,Earth Sci.

524,A Stepwise and Dynamic C-Vine Copula-Based Approach for Nonstationary Monthly Streamflow Forecasts,"In recent years, the stationary assumption of hydroclimatic variables as well as their temporal and spatial dependence structure have been challenged due to anthropogenic and climate changes. This study developed a stepwise and dynamic C-vine copula-based conditional model (SDCVC) to incorporate the nonstationarity into a monthly streamflow prediction, which depicted the predictor-predictand association on the basis of monthly streamflow and rainfall series of upstream and downstream stations in the Yangtze River basin of China. The model consists of (1) nonstationary modeling of the margins and nonstationary temporal and spatial dependence structure by the generalized additive models with location, scale, and shape (GAMLSS) and C-vine copula incorporating climate-related indexes as covariates during training time frames; and (2) a four-dimensional C-vine copula-based conditional quantile function to generate the simulated series during validation time frames. Three kinds of nonstationary models corresponding to different degrees were investigated to show the impact of nonstationarity on the streamflow forecasting. The proposed SDCVC model considering highest degree of nonstationarity outperformed the other two nonstationary models in terms of the performance metrics, because the SDCVC model not only described the dynamic change of time-varying connections between parameter and the large-scale climate forcings, but the stepwise strategy, by selecting the optimum time horizon, helped increase forecasting accuracy. Furthermore, the SDCVC model is superior, to some extent, to classical data-driven approaches [support vector regression (SVR) and adaptive-network-based fuzzy inference system (ANFIS)] in terms of the performance metrics.",https://doi.org/10.1061/(ASCE)HE.1943-5584.0002145,10.1061/(ASCE)HE.1943-5584.0002145,"Xu, Pengcheng; Wang, Dong; Wang, Yuankun; Singh, Vijay P.",JOURNAL OF HYDROLOGIC ENGINEERING,Monthly streamflow prediction; Dynamic C-vine copula; Nonstationarity; Generalized additive models with location; scale; and shape (GAMLSS); Climate change,SUPPORT VECTOR REGRESSION; RIVER FLOOD HAZARD; FREQUENCY-ANALYSIS; CLIMATE-CHANGE; YANGTZE-RIVER; MODELS; RAINFALL; PRECIPITATION; PREDICTION; DEPENDENCE,,ASCE-AMER SOC CIVIL ENGINEERS,RESTON,"1801 ALEXANDER BELL DR, RESTON, VA 20191-4400 USA",1084-0699,1943-5584,,J HYDROL ENG,J.

525,Conditioning ensemble streamflow prediction with the North Atlantic Oscillation improves skill at longer lead times,"Skilful hydrological forecasts can benefit decision-making in water resources management and other water-related sectors that require long-term planning. In Ireland, no such service exists to deliver forecasts at the catchment scale. In order to understand the potential for hydrological forecasting in Ireland, we benchmark the skill of ensemble streamflow prediction (ESP) for a diverse sample of 46 catchments using the GR4J (Genie Rural a 4 parametres Journalier) hydrological model. Skill is evaluated within a 52-year hindcast study design over lead times of 1 d to 12 months for each of the 12 initialisation months, January to December. Our results show that ESP is skilful against a probabilistic climatology benchmark in the majority of catchments up to several months ahead. However, the level of skill was strongly dependent on lead time, initialisation month, and individual catchment location and storage properties. Mean ESP skill was found to decay rapidly as a function of lead time, with a continuous ranked probability skill score (CRPSS) of 0.8 (1 d), 0.32 (2-week), 0.18 (1-month), 0.05 (3-month), and 0.01 (12-month). Forecasts were generally more skilful when initialised in summer than other seasons. A strong correlation (rho = 0.94) was observed between forecast skill and catchment storage capacity (baseflow index), with the most skilful regions, the Midlands and the East, being those where slowly responding, high-storage catchments are located. Forecast reliability and discrimination were also assessed with respect to low- and high-flow events. In addition to our benchmarking experiment, we conditioned ESP with the winter North Atlantic Oscillation (NAO) using adjusted hindcasts from the Met Office's Global Seasonal Forecasting System version 5. We found gains in winter forecast skill (CRPSS) of 7 %-18% were possible over lead times of 1 to 3 months and that improved reliability and discrimination make NAO-conditioned ESP particularly effective at forecasting dry winters, a critical season for water resources management.

526,Spatial-temporal distribution and forecasting model of precipitation using dynamic-statistical information fusion,"In order to explore the evolvement mechanism of hydrometeorological elements, spatial-temporal distribution of precipitation in the Huai river basin is studied by statistical drawing and empirical orthogonal function decomposition. How to make an objective combination for the predictive results of precipitation? Information fusion in data assimilation is introduced to merge the improved National Centers for Environmental Prediction coupled forecast system model version 2 (CFSv2) with the multilinear regression model. Firstly, in terms of time, the annual precipitation is apt to decline at most stations within 30 years, and precipitation mainly concentrates in the flood season. The characteristics of spatial distribution are similar to topographic features. It can also be found that precipitation gradually decreases from south to north. Secondly, from statistical forecasting, the relationship between precipitation and global sea surface temperature (SST) is explored. Prediction equation is established with SST and the average precipitation. Thirdly, from dynamic model forecasting, the CFSv2 original model and the CFSv2 statistical downscaling model are used to analyze the influence of model deviation on fusion prediction. The optimum interpolation assimilation method is applied for realizing the optimal integration of statistical and dynamic model prediction. Finally, the standardized precipitation index (SPI) is calculated by the combined forecasting of annual precipitation to evaluate drought conditions. The results show that SST is an important factor affecting precipitation, which may be applied as a forecasting direction with other factors. The merged prediction by the CFSv2 original model and the statistical model does not have the great promotion, which is still low than the prediction by the statistical model. The merged prediction by the CFSv2 statistical downscaling model and the statistical model is better than the predictions by the two models, respectively. These indicate that when the prediction difference between the models is large, the merged prediction error cannot be minimized. When the prediction skill levels are equal, there is an improvement in the merged result. So, it is necessary to revise the climate dynamic model by downscaling. What is more, the obtained drought levels match the actual disaster conditions, providing theoretical support of hydrology and meteorology for the prevention of natural disasters.",https://doi.org/10.2166/wcc.2022.375,10.2166/wcc.2022.375,"Zhao, Jun; Xu, Jinchao; Wang, Guoqing; Jin, Juliang; Hu, Xiaojie; Guo, Yan; Li, Xuechun",JOURNAL OF WATER AND CLIMATE CHANGE,dynamic-statistical information fusion; forecasting model; precipitation; sea surface temperature (SST); spatio-temporal distribution; standardized precipitation index (SPI),SEASONAL CLIMATE; PREDICTION; EVENTS; WEATHER; RUNOFF,,IWA PUBLISHING,LONDON,"REPUBLIC-EXPORT BLDG, UNITS 1 04 & 1 05, 1 CLOVE CRESCENT, LONDON, ENGLAND",2040-2244,2408-9354,,J WATER CLIM CHANGE,J.

As a result, it leads to overestimation of prognostic levels with actual state. This problem is most acute within the Almaty urban agglomeration. The choice of this region as a pioneer is obvious for hydrogeologists. Within the limits of the allocated territory as of 2008, the state balance accounts for about 15% of the total value of the drinking water quality of groundwater resources in the Republic of Kazakhstan. The volume of groundwater production within the region is about 45%. This burden on the subsoil is not presented in any other region of the Republic of Kazakhstan. On the basis of available developments in this issue, given appropriate solutions and ways of changing existing approaches to hydrogeological forecasts in estimating groundwater reserves are proposed to eliminate emerging inconsistencies, i.e. the implementation of forecasting taking into account the real, rather than overestimated in the calculation of the dynamics of water withdrawal.",https://doi.org/,,"Sotnikov, Y.

In this study, new generation deep learning models, recurrent neural network (RNN) and long short-term memory (LSTM), were applied for forecasting monthly rainfall, using long sequential raw data for time series analysis. All-India monthly average precipitation data for the period 1871-2016 were taken to build the models and they were tested on different homogeneous regions of India to check their robustness. From the results, it is evident that both the trained models (RNN and LSTM) performed well for different homogeneous regions of India based on the raw data. The study shows that a deep learning network can be applied successfully for time series analysis in the field of hydrology and allied fields to mitigate the risks of climatic extremes.",https://doi.org/10.1080/02626667.2019.1595624,10.1080/02626667.2019.1595624,"Kumar, Deepak; Singh, Anshuman; Samui, Pijush; Jha, Rishi Kumar",HYDROLOGICAL SCIENCES JOURNAL-JOURNAL DES SCIENCES HYDROLOGIQUES,precipitation; deep learning; rainfall prediction; sequential modelling,ARTIFICIAL NEURAL-NETWORK; MONTHLY RAINFALL; PREDICTION; WAVELET; SERIES; INDIA; OPTIMIZATION; REGIONS,,TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD,ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OR14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0262-6667,2150-3435,,HYDROLOG SCI J,Hydrol.

530,Development of a monthly to seasonal forecast framework tailored to inland waterway transport in central Europe,"Traditionally, navigation-related forecasts in central Europe cover short-to medium-range lead times linked to the travel times of vessels to pass the main waterway bottlenecks leaving the loading ports. Without doubt, this aspect is still essential for navigational users, but in light of the growing political intention to use the free capacity of the inland waterway transport in Europe, additional lead time supporting strategic decisions is more and more in demand. However, no such predictions offering extended lead times of several weeks up to several months currently exist for considerable parts of the European waterway network. This paper describes the set-up of a monthly to seasonal forecasting system for the German stretches of the international waterways of the Rhine, Danube and Elbe rivers. Two competitive forecast approaches have been implemented: the dynamical set-up forces a hydrological model with post-processed outputs from ECMWF general circulation model System 4, whereas the statistical approach is based on the empirical relationship (teleconnection) of global oceanic, climate and regional hydro-meteorological data with river flows. The performance of both forecast methods is evaluated in relation to the climatological forecast (ensemble of historical streamflow) and the well-known ensemble streamflow prediction approach (ESP, ensemble based on historical meteorology) using common performance indicators (correlation coefficient; mean absolute error, skill score; mean squared error, skill score; and continuous ranked probability, skill score) and an impact-based evaluation quantifying the potential economic gain. The following four key findings result from this study: (1) as former studies for other regions of central Europe indicate, the accuracy and/or skill of the meteorological forcing used has a larger effect than the quality of initial hydrological conditions for relevant stations along the German waterways. (2) Despite the predictive limitations on longer lead times in central Europe, this study reveals the existence of a valuable predictability of streamflow on monthly up to seasonal timescales along the Rhine, upper Danube and Elbe waterways, and the Elbe achieves the highest skill and economic value. (3) The more physically based and the statistical approach are able to improve the predictive skills and economic value compared to climatology and the ESP approach. The specific forecast skill highly depends on the forecast location, the lead time and the season. (4) Currently, the statistical approach seems to be most skilful for the three waterways investigated. The lagged relationship between the monthly and/or seasonal streamflow and the climatic and/or oceanic variables vary between 1 month (e.g. local precipitation, temperature and soil moisture) up to 6 months (e.g. sea surface temperature). Besides focusing on improving the forecast methodology, especially by combining the individual approaches, the focus is on developing useful forecast products on monthly to seasonal timescales for waterway transport and to operationalize the related forecasting service.",https://doi.org/10.5194/hess-21-6401-2017,10.5194/hess-21-6401-2017,"Meissner, Dennis; Klein, Bastian; Ionita, Monica",HYDROLOGY AND EARTH SYSTEM SCIENCES,,NORTH-ATLANTIC OSCILLATION; SEA-SURFACE TEMPERATURE; RELATIVE ECONOMIC VALUE; LOW-FLOW FORECASTS; ENSEMBLE PREDICTION; RIVER FLOW; UNITED-STATES; 2015 DROUGHT; EL-NINO; SKILL,,COPERNICUS GESELLSCHAFT MBH,GOTTINGEN,"BAHNHOFSALLEE 1E, GOTTINGEN, 37081, GERMANY",1027-5606,1607-7938,,HYDROL EARTH SYST SC,Hydrol.

531,"Flood forecasting using an improved NARX network based on wavelet analysis coupled with uncertainty analysis by Monte Carlo simulations: a case study of Taihu Basin, China","Reliable flood forecasting can provide scientific basis for flood risk assessment and water resources management, and the Taihu water level forecasting with high precision is essential for flood control in the Taihu Basin. To increase the prediction accuracy, a coupling model (DWT-iNARX) is established by combining the discrete wavelet transformation (DWT) with improved nonlinear autoregressive with exogenous inputs network (iNARX), for predicting the daily Taihu water level during the flood season under different forecast periods. And the DWT-iNARX model is compared with the back-propagation neural network (BP) and iNARX models to assess its capability in prediction. Meanwhile, we propose an uncertainty analysis method based on Monte Carlo simulations (MCS) for quantifying model uncertainty and performing probabilistic water level forecast. The results show that three models achieve good simulation results with higher accuracy when the forecast period is short, such as 1-3 days. In overall performance, iNARX and DWT-iNARX models show superiority in comparison with the BP model, while the DWT-iNARX model yields the best performance among all the other models.

532,"Major Risks, Uncertain Outcomes: Making Ensemble Forecasts Work for Multiple Audiences","When extreme river levels are possible in a community, effective communication of weather and hydrologic forecasts is critical to protecting life and property. Residents, emergency personnel, and water resource managers need to make timely decisions about how and when to prepare. Uncertainty in forecasting is a critical component of this decision-making, but often poses a confounding factor for public and professional understanding of forecast products. A new suite of products from the National Weather Service's Hydrologic Ensemble Forecast System (HEFS) provides short- and long-range forecasts, ranging from 6 h to 1 yr, and shows uncertainty in hydrologic forecasts. To understand how various audiences use and interpret ensemble forecasts showing a range of hydrologic forecast possibilities, a research project was conducted using scenario-based focus groups and surveys with community residents, emergency managers, and water resource managers in West Virginia and Maryland. The research assessed the utility of the HEFS products, identified barriers to proper understanding of the products, and suggested modifications to product design that could improve the understandability and accessibility for a range of users. There was a difference between the residential users' reactions to the HEFS compared to the emergency managers and water resource managers, with the public reacting less favorably to all versions. The emergency managers preferred the revised HEFS products but had suggestions for additional changes, which were incorporated. Features such as interactive text boxes and forecaster's notes further enhanced the utility and understandability of the products.",https://doi.org/10.1175/WAF-D-18-0018.1,10.1175/WAF-D-18-0018.1,"Carr, Rachel Hogan; Montz, Burrell; Semmens, Kathryn; Maxfield, Keri; Connolly, Samantha; Ahnert, Peter; Shedd, Rob; Elliott, Jason",WEATHER AND FORECASTING,Social Science; Ensembles; Probability forecasts; models; distribution; Communications; decision making; Flood events; Societal impacts,COMMUNICATING PROBABILISTIC INFORMATION; WEATHER FORECASTS; ADAPTATION; LESSONS; SCIENCE,,AMER METEOROLOGICAL SOC,BOSTON,"45 BEACON ST, BOSTON, MA 02108-3693 USA",0882-8156,1520-0434,,WEATHER FORECAST,Weather Forecast.,OCT,2018,33,5,1359,1373,,
533,K-Medoids Clustering Based Approach to Predict the Future Water Height of a Reservoir,"Water is a scarce resource, which needs to be managed optimally. A reservoir is a key water storage source in water management, where they are utilized by various sectors for different purposes. Therefore, there is an essential need in taking the best decision in releasing water from reservoirs not only to manage water as a resource, but also to mitigate floods, which has been one of the most expensive natural disasters causing an increased impact on human causalities and property damage. Research on predicting the future water height of reservoirs, when the reservoir receives a significant amount of rainfall and the water inflow is uncertain due to human intervention, are very limited. Hence, this research proposes a prediction model to forecast the future water height of a reservoir, when the reservoir receives a significant amount of rainfall and the water inflow is uncertain. It presents the effectiveness of applying K-Medoids clustering on top of regression model in predicting the future water height on next three days, while identifying the most effective set of features of the model.",https://doi.org/,,"Rushdi, M.

Shannon's entropy model is a new model in evaluating dangers and it has not yet been used to evaluate flood potential. Therefore, being a new model in determining flood potential, it requires evaluation and investigation in different regions and this study is going to deal with this issue. For to this purpose, 70 flooding areas were recognized and their distribution map was provided by ArcGIS10.2 software in the study area. Information layers of altitude, slope angle, slope aspect, plan curvature, drainage density, distance from the river, topographic wetness index (TWI), lithology, soil type, and land use were recognized as factors affecting flooding and the mentioned maps were provided and digitized by GIS environment. Then, flood susceptibility forecasting map was provided and model accuracy evaluation was conducted using ROC curve and 30% flooding areas express good precision of the model (73.5%) for the study area.",https://doi.org/10.1007/s12040-017-0819-x,10.1007/s12040-017-0819-x,"Haghizadeh, Ali; Siahkamari, Safoura; Haghiabi, Amir Hamzeh; Rahmati, Omid",JOURNAL OF EARTH SYSTEM SCIENCE,Flood susceptibility; Shannon's entropy; Madarsoo; GIS,SUPPORT VECTOR MACHINE; LOGISTIC-REGRESSION; STATISTICAL-MODELS; RIVER-BASIN; SUSCEPTIBILITY; GIS; BIVARIATE; WEIGHTS; INDEX,,INDIAN ACAD SCIENCES,BANGALORE,"C V RAMAN AVENUE, SADASHIVANAGAR, P B #8005, BANGALORE 560 080, INDIA",2347-4327,0973-774X,,J EARTH SYST SCI,J.

535,"Linear Regression Analysis and Statistical Models Using Oceanic and Atmospheric Variables for Streamflow Forecasting in Chixoy River, Guatemala","The objective of this study is to forecast streamflows in the Chixoy River Basin, Guatemala. The basin covers an area of about 5,000 km(2), it is located upstream of the Usumacinta River which drains into the Mexican Gulf, and it was selected as case study because it supplies the main hydropower plant of the country. Based on teleconnection principles and linear multiple regression analysis, statistical models were performed. The independent variables were oceanic and atmospheric indices used for monitoring El Nino South Oscillation (ENSO) by the National Weather Service/Climate Prediction Center of the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA). These variables include sea level pressures (SLP), southern oscillation index (SOI), sea surface temperatures (SST), and trade winds (TW) in different regions of the Tropical Pacific Ocean, as well as autocorrelation of the river flows. The dependent variable was the seasonal (three-monthly average) river flow into the hydropower reservoir Chixoy for the period 1980-2009, which was operated by the Guatemalan National Electrification Institute (INDE in Spanish). The models were assessed through multiple step-wise regression analysis and cross correlations lagged from 1 to 12 months. To appraise the forecast potential of the model, cross validation was performed where the correlation coefficient, the difference between the forecast and the observed river flow, and the standard error were evaluated. In addition, the Durbin-Watson test was applied to verify that there was no autocorrelation on residuals. Six models were developed for the trimesters September-October-November (r(2)=0.803); OctoberNovember-December (r(2)= 0.748); November-December-January (r(2)=0.818); December-JanuaryFebruary (r(2)=0.800); January-February-March (r(2)=0.820); and February-March-April (r(2) =0.855).",https://doi.org/,,"Dobias, Jonas; Salvinelli, Carlo","WORLD ENVIRONMENTAL AND WATER RESOURCES CONGRESS 2018: GROUNDWATER, SUSTAINABILITY, AND HYDRO-CLIMATE/CLIMATE CHANGE",El Nino South Oscillation; multiple regression analysis; statistical models; hydrological forecasting,NORTHERN SOUTH-AMERICA,,AMER SOC CIVIL ENGINEERS,NEW YORK,"UNITED ENGINEERING CENTER, 345 E 47TH ST, NEW YORK, NY 10017-2398 USA",,,978-0-7844-8141-7,,,,2018,,,280,286,,
536,Watershed-scale-based forecast method for leaf area index data based on the integration of time series MODIS products and meteorological data,"The leaf area index (LAI) is an important parameter used to characterize land vegetation growth patterns, and LAI forecasts are highly beneficial to natural resource management decisions. However, the LAI can be affected by biophysical, climate, and anthropogenic factors, thus, its future watershed-scale patterns remain difficult to assess. Herein, an object-oriented watershed-scale LAI forecasting (OWLF) method is proposed to solve the forecasting difficulties encountered when using only past meteorological data. The model was constructed with filtered multi-year MODIS LAI time series and climate index variables. Then, the dependence of the LAI on four mean monthly climate index variables was evaluated, namely, latent evapotranspiration, rainfall capacity, average air temperature, and sunlight hours, in the Poyang Lake basin. By combining the climate indexes derived from the past 1-3months, the model forecasts the subsequent months LAI for different land cover types. The LAI forecasting results derived with a 13-year time series (2000-2012) suggest that the OWLF method can effectively recognize the expected spatial patterns, and the data agreed reasonably well with LAI dynamics and phenological periods. This work offers a promising way to exploit combined satellite and climate index data in novel and more accurate watershed-scale forecasting studies.",https://doi.org/10.1007/s12665-019-8477-8,10.1007/s12665-019-8477-8,"Jiang, Hui; Gong, Jianya; Chen, Xiaoling; Liu, Yao",ENVIRONMENTAL EARTH SCIENCES,Leaf area index; Poyang Lake basin; Forecast; MODIS; Meteorological data,GLOBAL PRODUCTS; LAI; VEGETATION; CLIMATE; CANOPY; FOREST; VALIDATION; RETRIEVAL; DYNAMICS; STRESS,,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"233 SPRING ST, NEW YORK, NY 10013 USA",1866-6280,1866-6299,,ENVIRON EARTH SCI,Environ.

537,Forecasting water quality parameters using artificial neural network for irrigation purposes,"This study was aimed at analyzing the water quality of Ele River Nnewi, Anambra State for irrigation purposes with a view to predicting a one-year water quality index using Artificial Neural Network (ANN). Water pollution has posed a major problem and identifying the points of pollution in the River system is a very difficult task. To overcome this task, the need to determine the pollution level arose by modeling and predicting four water quality parameters at four (4) different locations using the Artificial Neural Network. These parameters include the pH, Total Dissolved Solids (TDS), Electrical Conductivity (EC), and Sodium (Na), respectively. The water quality results showed that the pH values which ranges from 6.01 to 6.87 were within the FAO standard in all the points for both rainy and dry seasons, whereas the TDS (mg/l), EC (dS/m) and Na (mg/l) parametric values range from 2001 to 2506, 3.01 to 5.76, and 40.42 to 73.45 respectively, were above the FAO standard from point 1 to point 3 and falls within the FAO standard at point 4 with values ranging from 1003 to 1994, 2.01 to 2.78 and 31.24 to 39.44, respectively. However, during the dry season, the TDS, EC, and Na values range from 2002 to 2742, 3.04 to 5.82 and 40.14 to 88.45 respectively, were all above the FAO standard. Generally, the artificial neural network modeled the actual water quality data set very well with good prediction. The training model performance evaluation shows that the R-2 values ranges from 0.981 to 0.990, 0.981 to 0.988, 0.981 to 0.989 and 0981 to 0.989, for pH, TDS, EC, and Na. The testing model performance shows that the R-2 value ranges from 0.952 to 0.967, 0.953 to 0.970, 0.951 to 0.967and 0.953 to 0.968, for pH, TDS, EC and Na while the forecast performance evaluation shows that the R-2 values ranges from 0.945 to 0.968, 0.946 to 0.968, 0.944 to 0.967 and 0.949 to 0.965 for pH, TDS, EC and Na respectively. It was also observed that the Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE) ranges from 0.022 to 0.088, 0.012 to 0.087, 0.015 to 0.085 and 0.014 to 0.084 for pH, TDS, EC and Na, respectively.

538,Daily flow forecasting of perennial rivers in an arid watershed: a hybrid ensemble decomposition approach integrated with computational intelligence techniques,"Accurate estimating of daily streamflow forecasting is one of the prominent topics in water resources activities. In this paper, an integrated method including decomposition technique based on the ensemble empirical mode decomposition (EEMD) combined with multivariate adaptive regression spline (MARS) was carried out to predict daily streamflow values. Daily streamflow value datasets collected from two stations in Iran (Gachsar and Kordkheyl) were selected. After dividing into calibration and validation datasets, each of them was decomposed by EEMD. Crow search algorithm (CSA) was used to optimize the MARS parameters (MARS-CSA). The performance of the integrated model (EEMD-MARS-CSA) was investigated by error indices (correlation coefficient (R), root mean squared error (RMSE), mean absolute error (MAE), Nash-Sutcliffe efficiency (NSE), as well as RMSE to standard deviation ratio (RSR)). From the results, EEMD was an important tool for increasing model accuracy and EEMD-MARS-CSA outperformed other alternative methods for daily streamflow estimation. According to one-day-ahead flow forecasting, EEMD-MARS-CSA (R = 0.94, RMSE = 5.94 m(3)/s (Kordkheyl) and R = 0.98, RMSE = 0.71 m(3)/s (Gachsar)) outperformed EEMD-MT/MARS, MT, and MARS models. Furthermore, RSR criterion of EEMD-MARS-CSA was reduced by 18%, 16%, and 17% for 3-days, 1-week, and 2-weeks-ahead streamflow forecasting compared to MARS-CSA model, respectively, for Gachsar station.",https://doi.org/10.2166/aqua.2020.138,10.2166/aqua.2020.138,"Torabi, Seyed Alireza; Mastouri, Reza; Najarchi, Mohsen",JOURNAL OF WATER SUPPLY RESEARCH AND TECHNOLOGY-AQUA,crow search algorithm; daily streamflow forecasting; ensemble empirical mode decomposition; multivariate adaptive regression spline; uncertainty analysis,EMPIRICAL MODE DECOMPOSITION; ARTIFICIAL NEURAL-NETWORK; SUPPORT VECTOR REGRESSION; STREAMFLOW; PREDICTION; SERIES; WAVELET; PREDICTABILITY; ANN,,IWA PUBLISHING,LONDON,"ALLIANCE HOUSE, 12 CAXTON ST, LONDON SW1H0QS, ENGLAND",0003-7214,1365-2087,,J WATER SUPPLY RES T,J.

539,A Rapid Forecasting and Mapping System of Storm Surge and Coastal Flooding,"A prototype of an efficient and accurate rapid forecasting and mapping system (RFMS) of storm surge is presented. Given a storm advisory from the National Hurricane Center, the RFMS can generate a coastal inundation map on a high-resolution grid in 1 min (reference system Intel Core i7-3770K). The foundation of the RFMS is a storm surge database consisting of high-resolution simulations of 490 optimal storms generated by a robust storm surge modeling system, Curvilinear-Grid Hydrodynamics in 3D (CH3D-SSMS). The RFMS uses an efficient quick kriging interpolation scheme to interpolate the surge response from the storm surge database, which considers tens of thousands of combinations of five landfall parameters of storms: central pressure deficit, radius to maximum wind, forward speed, heading direction, and landfall location. The RFMS is applied to southwest Florida using data from Hurricane Charley in 2004 and Hurricane Irma in 2017, and to the Florida Panhandle using data from Hurricane Michael in 2018 and validated with observed high water mark data. The RFMS results agree well with observation and direct simulation of the high-resolution CH3D-SSMS. The RFMS can be used for real-time forecasting during a hurricane or what-if'' scenarios for mitigation planning and preparedness training, or to produce a probabilistic flood map.

540,A Model to Forecast Methane Emissions from Topical and Subtropical Reservoirs on the Basis of Artificial Neural Networks,"In view of the great paucity of information on the exact contributions of different causes which lead to different extents of emission of the greenhouse gas methane (CH4) form reservoirs, it is tremendously challenging to develop statistical or analytical models for forecasting such emissions. Artificial neural networks (ANNs) have the ability to discern linear or non-linear relationships despite very limited data inputs and can recognize even complex patterns in a data set without a priori understating of the underlying mechanism. Hence, we have used ANNs to develop a model linking CH4 emissions to five of the reservoir parameters about which data is most commonly available in the prior art. Using a compendium of all available data on these parameters, of which a small part was kept aside for use in model validation, it has been possible to develop a model which is able to forecast CH4 emissions with a root mean square error of 37. It indicates a precision significantly better than the ones achieved in previous reports. The model provides a means to estimate CH4 emissions from reservoirs of which age, mean depth, surface area, latitude and longitude are known.",https://doi.org/10.3390/w12010145,10.3390/w12010145,"Tabassum-Abbasi; Abbasi, Tasneem; Luithui, Chirchom; Abbasi, S.

541,"Seasonal prediction of Indian summer monsoon in India: The past, the present and the future","Seasonal prediction of summer monsoon in India has had a long history and India has made significant strides in making reliable seasonal predictions. This article provides a detailed review of the progress made in the field of seasonal prediction by India starting from the first attempt of seasonal prediction by India Meteorology Department (IMD) in 1886 based on empirical methods to the present day state-of-the-art coupled dynamical modelling framework developed under Monsoon Mission. The success and failures of seasonal prediction were amply documented in several articles particularly with more emphasis on its failures. Starting in the early 1900s, the empirical models performed very well for a few decades after which they started failing. As the relationship with predictors underwent significant changes, empirical models were also updated/revamped on several occasions. Prior to Monsoon Mission (before 2010) attempts were made to use dynamical models for seasonal prediction of Indian monsoon, particularly in the tier-II modelling framework, which was based upon the standalone Atmospheric General Circulation Models (AGCMs), albeit with limited success. The immediate need for coupled modelling framework in India was felt in 2008-09 for making seasonal forecasts, primarily to model the dynamical nature of Indian Monsoon and hence, a coupled dynamical modelling framework at a very high atmospheric horizontal resolution of similar to 38 km was implemented to make operational/experimental seasonal forecasts, so far unparalleled. The dynamical modelling framework will be upgraded in the future to contain an earth system framework with aerosols/greenhouse gases, ocean bio-geo chemistry and closed model hydrology.",https://doi.org/,,"Rao, Suryachandra A.; Pillai, Prasanth A.; Pradhan, Maheshwar; Srivastava, Ankur",MAUSAM,Seasonal prediction; Monsoon; Monsoon mission,SYSTEM VERSION 2; LONG-RANGE FORECASTS; SOUTHERN-OSCILLATION; EL-NINO; RAINFALL; CLIMATE; IMPACT; VARIABILITY; SIMULATION; CIRCULATION,,INDIA METEOROLOGICAL DEPT,NEW DELHI,"MAUSAM BHAWAN, LODI RD, NEW DELHI, 110 003, INDIA",0252-9416,,,MAUSAM,Mausam,APR,2019,70,2,265,276,,
542,Adaptive Fast Orthogonal Search (FOS) algorithm for forecasting streamflow,"Data-driven models for streamflow forecasting have attracted considerable attention, as they are independent of physical system features. The physical features of the river basin are extremely hard to collect, especially for large rivers. Empirical data-driven models, such as stochastic and regression models, have been widely used in the field of streamflow forecasting. However, they suffered limited accuracy in predicting extreme streamflow. They also required raw data pre-processing prior to the modeling process, especially for lengthy data records and for large time-scale increments (e.g. monthly resolution). To overcome these challenges, data-driven forecasting models based on Artificial Intelligence (AI) have been widely used and resulted in enhancing the forecasting accuracy. Nevertheless, AI-based models required augmentation with proper optimization schemes to adjust the model parameters for optimal accuracy. Furthermore, in some cases, due to unsuitability of the optimization model, there is high possibility for overfitting of the AI model, which might cause poor prediction of input patterns that were not adequately mimicked. This study introduces a new approach to streamflow forecasting based on nonlinear system identification. The proposed technique employs Fast Orthogonal Search (FOS) to develop a nonlinear model of stream flow. The main advantage of using FOS is eliminating the requirement of raw data pre-processing and the need for an optimization scheme for model parameter adjustment since the FOS algorithm takes this into account while building the model. In addition, the FOS algorithm includes a pole-zero cancellation procedure that can detect and avoid the over-fitted models. The FOS-based nonlinear modeling approach was adopted in this research for the development of a streamflow forecasting model at Aswan High Dam using monthly basis natural streamflow records for 130 years. The results indicated that the proposed FOS algorithm outperformed the previously developed AI models of streamflow forecasting for large data records and for large time-scale increment (monthly resolution).",https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jhydrol.2020.124896,10.1016/j.jhydrol.2020.124896,"Osman, Abdalla; Afan, Haitham Abdulmohsin; Allawi, Mohammed Falah; Jaafar, Othman; Noureldin, Aboelmagd; Hamzah, Firdaus Mohamad; Ahmed, Ali Najah; El-shafie, Ahmed",JOURNAL OF HYDROLOGY,Nonlinear system identification; Streamflow forecasting; Aswan High Dam; River Nile; Multi-lead forecasting,NEURAL-NETWORK MODEL; MULTI-LEAD; SHORT-TERM; WAVELET; RIVER; PREDICTION; HYDROLOGY,,ELSEVIER,AMSTERDAM,"RADARWEG 29, 1043 NX AMSTERDAM, NETHERLANDS",0022-1694,1879-2707,,J HYDROL,J.

543,"A regional hindcast model simulating ecosystem dynamics, inorganic carbon chemistry, and ocean acidification in the Gulf of Alaska","The coastal ecosystem of the Gulf of Alaska (GOA) is especially vulnerable to the effects of ocean acidification and climate change. Detection of these long-term trends requires a good understanding of the system's natural state. The GOA is a highly dynamic system that exhibits large inorganic carbon variability on subseasonal to interannual timescales. This variability is poorly understood due to the lack of observations in this expansive and remote region. We developed a new model setup for the GOA that couples the three-dimensional Regional Oceanic Model System (ROMS) and the Carbon, Ocean Biogeochemistry and Lower Trophic (COBALT) ecosystem model. To improve our conceptual understanding of the system, we conducted a hindcast simulation from 1980 to 2013. The model was explicitly forced with temporally and spatially varying coastal freshwater discharges from a high-resolution terrestrial hydrological model, thereby affecting salinity, alkalinity, dissolved inorganic carbon, and nutrient concentrations. This represents a substantial improvement over previous GOA modeling attempts. Here, we evaluate the model on seasonal to interannual timescales using the best available inorganic carbon observations. The model was particularly successful in reproducing observed aragonite oversaturation and undersaturation of near-bottom water in May and September, respectively. The largest deficiency in the model is its inability to adequately simulate springtime surface inorganic carbon chemistry, as it overestimates surface dissolved inorganic carbon, which translates into an underestimation of the surface aragonite saturation state at this time. We also use the model to describe the seasonal cycle and drivers of inorganic carbon parameters along the Seward Line transect in undersampled months. Model output suggests that the majority of the near-bottom water along the Seward Line is seasonally undersaturated with respect to aragonite between June and January, as a result of upwelling and remineralization. Such an extensive period of reoccurring aragonite undersaturation may be harmful to ocean acidification-sensitive organisms. Furthermore, the influence of freshwater not only decreases the aragonite saturation state in coastal surface waters in summer and fall, but it simultaneously decreases the surface partial pressure of carbon dioxide (pCO(2)), thereby decoupling the aragonite saturation state from pCO(2). The full seasonal cycle and geographic extent of the GOA region is under-sampled, and our model results give new and important insights for months of the year and areas that lack in situ inorganic carbon observations.",https://doi.org/10.5194/bg-17-3837-2020,10.5194/bg-17-3837-2020,"Hauri, Claudine; Schultz, Cristina; Hedstrom, Katherine; Danielson, Seth; Irving, Brita; Doney, Scott C.; Dussin, Raphael; Curchitser, Enrique N.; Hill, David F.; Stock, Charles A.",BIOGEOSCIENCES,,FRESH-WATER DISCHARGE; NORTHERN GULF; ARAGONITE SATURATION; REACTIVE IRON; VARIABILITY; CO2; SURFACE; GLACIER; SYSTEM; CLIMATOLOGY,,COPERNICUS GESELLSCHAFT MBH,GOTTINGEN,"BAHNHOFSALLEE 1E, GOTTINGEN, 37081, GERMANY",1726-4170,1726-4189,,BIOGEOSCIENCES,Biogeosciences,JUL 29,2020,17,14,3837,3857,,
544,Simple and Low-Cost Procedure for Monthly and Yearly Streamflow Forecasts during the Current Hydrological Year,"Accurately forecasting streamflow values is essential to achieve an efficient, integrated water resources management strategy and to provide consistent support to water decision-makers. We present a simple, low-cost, and robust approach for forecasting monthly and yearly streamflows during the current hydrological year, which is applicable to headwater catchments. The procedure innovatively combines the use of well-known regression analysis techniques, the two-parameter Gamma continuous cumulative probability distribution function and the Monte Carlo method. Several model performance statistics metrics (including the Coefficient of Determination R-2; the Root-Mean-Square Error RMSE; the Mean Absolute Error MAE; the Index of Agreement IOA; the Mean Absolute Percent Error MAPE; the Coefficient of Nash-Sutcliffe Efficiency NSE; and the Inclusion Coefficient IC) were used and the results showed good levels of accuracy (improving as the number of observed months increases). The model forecast outputs are the mean monthly and yearly streamflows along with the 10th and 90th percentiles. The methodology has been successfully applied to two headwater reservoirs within the Guadalquivir River Basin in southern Spain, achieving an accuracy of 92% and 80% in March 2017. These risk-based predictions are of great value, especially before the intensive irrigation campaign starts in the middle of the hydrological year, when Water Authorities have to ensure that the right decision is made on how to best allocate the available water volume between the different water users and environmental needs.",https://doi.org/10.3390/w10081038,10.3390/w10081038,"Delgado-Ramos, Fernando; Hervas-Gamez, Carmen",WATER,integrated water resources management; support to decision-making process; streamflow forecast; simple and low-cost forecasting model; Guadalquivir River Basin; Genil River,SUPPORT VECTOR REGRESSION; NEURAL-NETWORKS; RAINFALL; MODEL; RESERVOIR; MANAGEMENT; DROUGHT; VARIABILITY; SPAIN,,MDPI,BASEL,"ST ALBAN-ANLAGE 66, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND",2073-4441,,,WATER-SUI,Water,AUG,2018,10,8,,,1038,

Statistical indicators and the Soil and Water Assessment Tool (SWAT) model are employed to investigate the hydrological performances of the GMPs against the data of 17 rain gauges distributed across the CRB. The results show that there are strong correlations between the temperature reanalysis products in both CMADS and CFSR and those obtained from the ground-based observations (the correlation coefficients range from 0.92 to 0.97). The CFSR data overestimate precipitation (percentage bias approximately 99%) at both daily and monthly scales, whereas the CMADS product performs better, with obvious differences (compared to the ground-based observations) in high-terrain areas. Regarding the simulated river flows, CFSR-SWAT produced unsatisfactory, while CMADS-SWAT (R-2 > 0.76 and NSE > 0.78) performs better than CFSR-SWAT on the monthly scale. This assessment of the applicative potential of GMPs, especially CMADS, may further provide an additional rapid alternative for water resource research and management in basins with similar hydro-meteorological conditions.",https://doi.org/10.3390/w13091314,10.3390/w13091314,"Dao, Duy Minh; Lu, Jianzhong; Chen, Xiaoling; Kantoush, Sameh A.; Binh, Doan Van; Phan, Phamchimai; Tung, Nguyen Xuan",WATER,Cau River basin; CFSR; CMADS; SWAT model; tropical monsoon; reanalysis data; GMP; extreme weather event,ASSIMILATION DRIVING DATASETS; SATELLITE RAINFALL PRODUCTS; FORECAST SYSTEM REANALYSIS; HIGH-RESOLUTION SATELLITE; SWAT MODEL; WEATHER DATA; NCEP-CFSR; PRECIPITATION; UNCERTAINTY; STREAMFLOW,,MDPI,BASEL,"ST ALBAN-ANLAGE 66, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND",,2073-4441,,WATER-SUI,Water,MAY,2021,13,9,,,1314,
546,The Adaptive-Clustering and Error-Correction Method for Forecasting Cyanobacteria Blooms in Lakes and Reservoirs,"Globally, cyanobacteria blooms frequently occur, and effective prediction of cyanobacteria blooms in lakes and reservoirs could constitute an essential proactive strategy for water-resource protection. However, cyanobacteria blooms are very complicated because of the internal stochastic nature of the system evolution and the external uncertainty of the observation data. In this study, an adaptive-clustering algorithm is introduced to obtain some typical operating intervals. In addition, the number of nearest neighbors used for modeling was optimized by particle swarm optimization. Finally, a fuzzy linear regression method based on error-correction was used to revise the model dynamically near the operating point. We found that the combined method can characterize the evolutionary track of cyanobacteria blooms in lakes and reservoirs. The model constructed in this paper is compared to other cyanobacteria-bloom forecasting methods (e.g., phase space reconstruction and traditional-clustering linear regression), and, then, the average relative error and average absolute error are used to compare the accuracies of these models. The results suggest that the proposed model is superior. As such, the newly developed approach achieves more precise predictions, which can be used to prevent the further deterioration of the water environment.",https://doi.org/10.1155/2017/9037358,10.1155/2017/9037358,"Bai, Xiao-zhe; Zhang, Hui-yan; Wang, Xiao-yi; Wang, Li; Xu, Ji-ping; Yu, Jia-bin",ADVANCES IN MATHEMATICAL PHYSICS,,TIME-SERIES PREDICTION,,HINDAWI LTD,LONDON,"ADAM HOUSE, 3RD FLR, 1 FITZROY SQ, LONDON, W1T 5HF, ENGLAND",1687-9120,1687-9139,,ADV MATH PHYS,Adv.

547,Use of MLCM3 Software for Flash Flood Modeling and Forecasting,"Accurate and timely flash floods forecasting, especially, in ungauged and poorly gauged basins, is one of the most important and challenging problems to be solved by the international hydrological community. In changing climate and variable anthropogenic impact on river basins, as well as due to low density of surface hydrometeorological network, flash flood forecasting based on traditional physically based, or conceptual, or statistical hydrological models often becomes inefficient. Unfortunately, most of river basins in Russia are poorly gauged or ungauged; besides, lack of hydrogeological data is quite typical. However, the developing economy and population safety necessitate issuing warnings based on reliable forecasts. For this purpose, a new hydrological model, MLCM3 (Multi-Layer Conceptual Model, 3rd generation) has been developed in the Russian State Hydrometeorological University. The model showed good results in more than 50 tested basins.",https://doi.org/10.12911/22998993/79419,10.12911/22998993/79419,"Sokolova, Daria; Kuzmin, Vadim; Batyrov, Artur; Pivovarova, Inna; Ngoc Anh Tran; DinhKha Dang; Shemanaev, Kirill V.",JOURNAL OF ECOLOGICAL ENGINEERING,hydrological model; floods forecasting; river basins; changing climate,OPTIMIZATION; CALIBRATION; SYSTEMS,,POLISH SOC ECOLOGICAL ENGINEERING,LUBLIN,"LUBLIN UNIV TECHNOLOGY, ENVIRONMENTAL ENGINEERING FAC, LUBLIN, 20618, POLAND",2299-8993,,,J ECOL ENG,J.

548,Kabul River Flow Prediction Using Automated ARIMA Forecasting: A Machine Learning Approach,"The water level in a river defines the nature of flow and is fundamental to flood analysis. Extreme fluctuation in water levels in rivers, such as floods and droughts, are catastrophic in every manner; therefore, forecasting at an early stage would prevent possible disasters and relief efforts could be set up on time. This study aims to digitally model the water level in the Kabul River to prevent and alleviate the effects of any change in water level in this river downstream. This study used a machine learning tool known as the automatic autoregressive integrated moving average for statistical methodological analysis for forecasting the river flow. Based on the hydrological data collected from the water level of Kabul River in Swat, the water levels from 2011-2030 were forecasted, which were based on the lowest value of Akaike Information Criterion as 9.216. It was concluded that the water flow started to increase from the year 2011 till it reached its peak value in the year 2019-2020, and then the water level will maintain its maximum level to 250 cumecs and minimum level to 10 cumecs till 2030.

549,Comparison of generalized non-data-driven lake and reservoir routing models for global-scale hydrologic forecasting of reservoir outflow at diurnal time steps,"Large-scale hydrologic forecasts should account for attenuation through lakes and reservoirs when flow regulation is present. Globally generalized methods for approximating outflow are required but must contend with operational complexity and a dearth of information on dam characteristics at global spatial scales. There is currently no consensus on the best approach for approximating reservoir release rates in large spatial scale hydrologic forecasting, particularly at diurnal time steps. This research compares two parsimonious reservoir routing methods at daily steps: Doll et al. (2003) and Hanasaki et al. (2006). These reservoir routing methods have been previously implemented in large-scale hydrologic modeling applications and have been typically evaluated seasonally. These routing methods are compared across 60 reservoirs operated by the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers. The authors vary empirical coefficients for both reservoir routing methods as part of a sensitivity analysis. The method proposed by Doll et al. (2003) outperformed that presented by Hanasaki et al. (2006) at a daily time step and improved model skill over most run-of-the-river conditions. The temporal resolution of the model influences model performances. The optimal model coefficients varied across the reservoirs in this study and model performance fluctuates between wet years and dry years, and for different configurations such as dams in series. Overall, the method proposed by Doll et al. (2003) could enhance large-scale hydrologic forecasting, but can be subject to instability under certain conditions.",https://doi.org/10.5194/hess-24-2711-2020,10.5194/hess-24-2711-2020,"Gutenson, Joseph L.; Tavakoly, Ahmad A.; Wahl, Mark D.; Follum, Michael L.",HYDROLOGY AND EARTH SYSTEM SCIENCES,,LAND-SURFACE; WATER; SYSTEM; STORAGE; IMPACT; SCHEME,,COPERNICUS GESELLSCHAFT MBH,GOTTINGEN,"BAHNHOFSALLEE 1E, GOTTINGEN, 37081, GERMANY",1027-5606,1607-7938,,HYDROL EARTH SYST SC,Hydrol.

550,Decomposition-ANN Methods for Long-Term Discharge Prediction Based on Fisher's Ordered Clustering with MESA,"Precise and reliable long-term streamflow prediction contributes to water resources planning and management. Artificial neural network (ANN) have shown its remarkable ability in forecasting non-linear hydrological processes without involvement of complex, dynamic, hydrological and hydro-climatologic physical process in the water shed. To improve its non-stationary responses, decomposition methods are adopted as pre-processing methods in this study including Empirical Mode Decomposition (EMD), Ensemble Empirical Mode Decomposition (EEMD) and Seasonal-Trend decomposition using Loess (STL). The original time sequence is decomposed to several components, which are then taken as the inputs of the ANN model. EMD and EEMD are data- adaptable methods, and thus the number of Intrinsic Mode Functions (IMFs) might differ for different sequences, leading to the discrepancy of the input number for ANN model in training and predicting. Fisher's ordered clustering is thus used to classify the IMFs into a determined number of classes based on their frequency spectrum resulting from Maximum Entropy Spectral Analysis (MESA). The proposed methodology is applied on four important hydrological stations on the upper stream of the Yellow River and the Yangtze River in China, respectively, to forecast the streamflow of the next whole year with the historical daily data of the past 6years. The Nash-Sutcliffe efficiencies of the monthly prediction are higher than 0.85 for all of the four cases, and various indicators indicates that the proposed hybrid method of STL-ANN performs better than other compared methods. The highlights of this study lies in that only historical daily streamflow data is used to derive an accurate long-term prediction by data mining based on decomposition technology and mapping relationships between the decomposed components and the original sequence in the future.",https://doi.org/10.1007/s11269-019-02295-8,10.1007/s11269-019-02295-8,"Li, Fang-Fang; Wang, Zhi-Yu; Zhao, Xiao; Xie, En; Qiu, Jun",WATER RESOURCES MANAGEMENT,Long-term prediction; Ensemble empirical mode decomposition (EEMD); Artificial neural network (ANN); Hybrid model; Maximum entropy spectral analysis (MESA),ARTIFICIAL NEURAL-NETWORKS; EMPIRICAL MODE DECOMPOSITION; STREAMFLOW; RUNOFF; RAINFALL; RIVER; ENSEMBLE; SYSTEM,,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0920-4741,1573-1650,,WATER RESOUR MANAG,Water Resour.

551,Multi-temporal Hydrological Residual Error Modeling for Seamless Subseasonal Streamflow Forecasting,"Subseasonal streamflow forecasts, with lead times of 1-30 days, provide valuable information for operational water resource management. This paper introduces the multi-temporal hydrological residual error (MuTHRE) model to address the challenge of obtaining seamless subseasonal forecasts - that is, daily forecasts with consistent high-quality performance over multiple lead times (1-30 days) and aggregation scales (daily to monthly). The key advance of the MuTHRE model is combining the representation of three temporal characteristics of hydrological residual errors: seasonality, dynamic biases, and non-Gaussian errors. The MuTHRE model is applied in 11 Australian catchments using the hydrological model GR4J and post processed rainfall forecasts from the numerical weather prediction model ACCESS-S, and is evaluated against a baseline model that does not model these error characteristics. The MuTHRE model provides high improvements (practically significant in the majority of performance stratifications) in terms of reliability: (i) at short lead times (up to 10 days), due to representing non-Gaussian errors, (ii) stratified by month, due to representing seasonality in hydrological errors, and (iii) in dry years, due to representing dynamic biases in hydrological errors. Forecast performance also improves in terms of sharpness, volumetric bias, and CRPS skill score; these improvements are statistically but not practically significant in the majority of stratifications. Importantly, improvements are consistent across multiple time scales (daily and monthly). This study highlights the benefits of modeling multiple temporal characteristics of hydrological errors and demonstrates the power of the MuTHRE model for producing seamless subseasonal streamflow forecasts that can be utilized for a wide range of applications.",https://doi.org/10.1029/2019WR026979,10.1029/2019WR026979,"McInerney, David; Thyer, Mark; Kavetski, Dmitri; Laugesen, Richard; Tuteja, Narendra; Kuczera, George",WATER RESOURCES RESEARCH,subseasonal streamflow forecasts; seamless forecasts; probabilistic forecasts; residual error model; streamflow postprocessing,PARAMETER-ESTIMATION; SERVICE HEFS; ENSEMBLE; PREDICTION; RUNOFF; RANGE; UNCERTAINTY; CALIBRATION; INFERENCE; SKILL,,AMER GEOPHYSICAL UNION,WASHINGTON,"2000 FLORIDA AVE NW, WASHINGTON, DC 20009 USA",0043-1397,1944-7973,,WATER RESOUR RES,Water Resour.

552,An integrated modelling system for water quality forecasting in an urban eutrophic estuary: The Swan-Canning Estuary virtual observatory,"Effective short- and long-term estuarine water quality management decisions require a holistic view of estuarine response to multiple stressors that may be achieved through the integration of numerical modelling and observed data. Such an approach has been developed for the Swan-Canning Estuary system, a eutrophic urban estuary in Western Australia under threat from nutrient enrichment and a drying climate. Numerical modelling was integrated with long-term monitoring to develop the system Swan-Canning Estuary Virtual Observatory (SCEVO), which has been used to facilitate water quality management and streamline prediction workflows of hindcast, forecast, and environmental response functions. The system is based on a validated 3D water quality model, integrated within a data management system and related environmental models. A machine-learning method to improve the patchy and time-lagged catchment inputs is also highlighted. This work has identified that the key challenge associated with estuarine water quality prediction is the capability to (1) simulate internal physical and biogeochemical processes at suitable spatial resolution to resolve the gradients along the freshwater-ocean continuum; and (2) transition from using routine monitoring data as the basis for management decisions to using a diverse and integrated set of data streams as the basis for real-time operational decisions.

553,Selected model fusion: an approach for improving the accuracy of monthly streamflow forecasting,"Monthly streamflow forecasting plays an important role in water resources management, especially for dam operation. In this paper, an approach of model fusion technique named selected model fusion (SMF) is applied and assessed under two strategies of model selection in order to improve the accuracy of streamflow forecasting. The two strategies of SMF are: fusion of the outputs of best individual forecasting models (IFMs) selected by dendrogram analysis (S1), and fusion of the best outputs of all IFMs resulting from an ordered selection algorithm (S2). In both strategies, five data-driven models including: artificial neural network, generalized regression neural network, least square-support vector regression, K-nearest neighbor regression, and multiple linear regression with optimized structure are performed as IFMs. The SMF strategies are applied for forecasting the monthly inflow to Karkheh reservoir, Iran, owning various patterns between predictor and predicted variables in different months. Results show that applying SMF approach based on both strategies results in more accurate forecasts in comparison with fusion of all IFMs outputs (S3), as the benchmark. However, comparison of the two SMF strategies reveals that the implementation of strategy (S2) considerably improves the accuracy of forecasts than strategy (S1) as well as the best IFM results (S4) in all months.",https://doi.org/10.2166/hydro.2018.098,10.2166/hydro.2018.098,"Modaresi, Fereshteh; Araghinejad, Shahab; Ebrahimi, Kumars",JOURNAL OF HYDROINFORMATICS,Karkheh River; K-nearest neighbor; monthly streamflow forecasting; neural networks; selected model fusion; support vector regression,ARTIFICIAL NEURAL-NETWORK; SUPPORT VECTOR REGRESSION; MULTIMODEL DATA FUSION; PREDICTION; COMBINATION; ENSEMBLES; MACHINES,,IWA PUBLISHING,LONDON,"ALLIANCE HOUSE, 12 CAXTON ST, LONDON SW1H0QS, ENGLAND",1464-7141,1465-1734,,J HYDROINFORM,J.

To develop hybrid IIS-W-ANN model, a global predictor matrix is constructed for three local hydrological sites (Richmond, Gwydir, and Darling River) in Australia's agricultural (Murray-Darling) Basin. Model inputs comprised of statistically significant lagged combination of streamflow water level, are supplemented by meteorological data (i.e., precipitation, maximum and minimum temperature, mean solar radiation, vapor pressure and evaporation) as the potential model inputs. To establish robust forecasting models, iterative input selection (US) algorithm is applied to screen the best data from the predictor matrix and is integrated with the non-decimated maximum overlap discrete wavelet transform (MODWT) applied on the IIS-selected variables. This resolved the frequencies contained in predictor data while constructing a wavelet-hybrid (i.e., IIS-W-ANN and IIS-W-M5 Tree) model. Forecasting ability of US-W-ANN is evaluated via correlation coefficient (r), Willmott's Index (WI), Nash-Sutcliffe Efficiency (E-NS), root-mean-square-error (RMSE), and mean absolute error (MAE), including the percentage RMSE and MAE. While ANN models are seen to outperform M5 Tree executed for all hydrological sites, the IIS variable selector was efficient in determining the appropriate predictors, as stipulated by the better performance of the IIS coupled (ANN and M5 Tree) models relative to the models without IIS. When IIS-coupled models are integrated with MODWT, the wavelet-hybrid IIS-W-ANN and IIS-W-M5 Tree are seen to attain significantly accurate performance relative to their standalone counterparts. Importantly, IIS-W-ANN model accuracy outweighs IIS-ANN, as evidenced by a larger r and WI (by 7.5% and 3.8%, respectively) and a lower RMSE (by 21.3%). In comparison to the IIS-W-M5 Tree model, IIS-W-ANN model yielded larger values of WI = 0.936-0.979 and E-NS = 0.770-0.920. Correspondingly, the errors (RMSE and MAE) ranged from 0.162-0.487 m and 0.139-0.390 m, respectively, with relative errors, RRMSE = (15.65-21.00) % and MAPE = (14.79-20.78) %. Distinct geographic signature is evident where the most and least accurately forecasted streamflow data is attained for the Gwydir and Darling River, respectively. Conclusively, this study advocates the efficacy of iterative input selection, allowing the proper screening of model predictors, and subsequently, its integration with MODWT resulting in enhanced performance of the models applied in streamflow forecasting.",https://doi.org/10.1016/j.atmosres.2017.06.014,10.1016/j.atmosres.2017.06.014,"Prasad, Ramendra; Deo, Ravinesh C.; Li, Yan; Maraseni, Tek",ATMOSPHERIC RESEARCH,"Wavelet-hybrid model; Streamflow forecasting; Drought in Murray-Darling Basin; Iterative input selection algorithm, MODWT",SUPPORT VECTOR MACHINE; ARTIFICIAL NEURAL-NETWORK; DISCRETE WAVELET TRANSFORM; GLOBAL SOLAR-RADIATION; M5 MODEL TREES; VARIABLE SELECTION; PARTICLE SWARM; AUSTRALIAN RAINFALL; UPPER REACH; SHORT-TERM,,ELSEVIER SCIENCE INC,NEW YORK,"STE 800, 230 PARK AVE, NEW YORK, NY 10169 USA",0169-8095,1873-2895,,ATMOS RES,Atmos.

555,Predicting of daily Khazir basin flow using SWAT and hybrid SWAT-ANN models,"Soil and Water Assessment Tool (SWAT) and Artificial Neural Network (ANN) models have been successfully used in streamflow forecasting problems. In this research SWAT model and developed model called (hybrid SWAT-ANN) were applied for forecast daily streamflow for Khazir River at Asmawa and Khanis gauge stations which lies in Kurdistan region in Iraq. In order to calibration and validation of the models, the recorded daily flow which available for twelve years (2004-2015) was divided into two sets. The output of the SWAT model was compared with the recorded data of the streamflow, the residual time series values, which resulted from the comparison, was solved by using the ANN approach. Finally, hydrological model using combined SWAT and ANN tools were obtained, which called hybrid SWAT-ANN model. The root means square error (RMSE) and coefficient of determination (R-2) for Asmawa and Khanis stations using hybrid SWAT-ANN model were found to be more efficient than SWAT model in forecasting the daily streamflow of the basin.

556,Real-time Flood Classification Forecasting Based on k-means plus plus Clustering and Neural Network,"Floods are among the most dangerous disasters that affect human beings. Timely and accurate flood forecasting can effectively reduce losses to human life and property and improve the utilization of flood resources. In this study, a real-time flood classification and prediction method (RFC-P) was constructed based on factor analysis, the k-means++ clustering algorithm, SSE, a backpropagation neural network (BPNN) and the M-EIES model. Model parameters of different flood types were obtained to forecast floods. The RFC-P method was applied to the Jingle sub-basin in Shanxi Province. The results showed that the RFC-P method can be used for the real-time classification and prediction of floods. The parameters of the flood classification and prediction model were consistent with the characteristics of the flood events. Compared with the results of unclassified predictions, the Nash coefficient increased by 5%-11.62%, the relative error of the average flood peak was reduced by 6.08%-12.7%, the relative error of the average flood volume was reduced by 5.74%-8.07%, and the time difference of the average peak was reduced by 43%-66% based on the proposed approach. The methodology proposed in this study can be used to identify extreme flood events and provide scientific support for flood classification and prediction, flood control and disaster reduction in river basins, and the efficient utilization of water resources.",https://doi.org/10.1007/s11269-021-03014-y,10.1007/s11269-021-03014-y,Hu Caihong; Zhang Xueli; Li Changqing; Liu Chengshuai; Wang Jinxing; Jian Shengqi,WATER RESOURCES MANAGEMENT,Flood classification forecasting; Real-time classification; k-means plus plus; BPNN,XINANJIANG MODEL; PREDICTION; OPTIMIZATION; CALIBRATION; UNCERTAINTY; ERROR,,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0920-4741,1573-1650,,WATER RESOUR MANAG,Water Resour.

557,River flow prediction using hybrid PSOGSA algorithm based on feed-forward neural network,"River flow modeling plays an important role in water resources management. This research aims at developing a hybrid model that integrates the feed-forward neural network (FNN) with a hybrid algorithm of the particle swarm optimization and gravitational search algorithms (PSOGSA) to predict river flow. Fundamentally, as the precision of a FNN model is essentially dependent upon the assurance of its model parameters, this review utilizes the PSOGSA for ideal preparing of the FNN model and gives the likelihood of boosting the execution of FNN. For this purpose, monthly river flow time series from 1990 to 2016 for Garber station of the Turkey River located at Clayton County, Iowa, were used. The proposed FNN-PSOGSA was applied in monthly river flow data. The results indicate that the FNN-PSOGSA model improves the forecasting accuracy and is a feasible method in predicting the river flow.",https://doi.org/10.1007/s00500-018-3598-7,10.1007/s00500-018-3598-7,"Meshram, Sarita Gajbhiye; Ghorbani, Mohmmmad Ali; Shamshirband, Shahaboddin; Karimi, Vahid; Meshram, Chandrashekhar",SOFT COMPUTING,Feed-forward neural networks; Gravitational search algorithm; Hybrid model; Particle swarm optimization; River flow forecasting; Turkey River,PARTICLE SWARM OPTIMIZATION; TIME-SERIES; MODEL; ANN; PERFORMANCE,,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"ONE NEW YORK PLAZA, SUITE 4600, NEW YORK, NY, UNITED STATES",1432-7643,1433-7479,,SOFT COMPUT,Soft Comput.,OCT,2019,23,20,10429,10438,,
558,"Regional monthly runoff forecast in southern Canada using ANN, K-means, and L-moments techniques","River runoff forecasting is necessary for numerous applications related to water use, including water supply management, power generation and flooding protection measures. In this study, a regional model using an artificial neural network (ANN) is proposed for monthly runoff forecasting, which considers stations linked to the network that belong to the same homogeneous region, and are delimited using K-means (KM-ANN) and L-moments (LM-ANN) techniques. This methodology was applied to a sample of 90 monthly runoff series in southern Canada. The results were compared to those of a traditional neural network for a given site (ANNs) using statistical indices, such as root-mean-squared error (RMSE), relative square error (RSE), mean absolute error (MAE), relative absolute error (RAE), the concordance index (d) and the coefficient of determination (r(2)). The LM-ANN technique produced better forecasts in 56.7% of the analysed stations, whereas the KM-ANN and ANN techniques produced better forecasts in 27.7% and 15.6% of the stations, respectively. Thus, the results indicate that the regionalisation process improved the forecasts in 84.4% of the studied cases, and the estimation uncertainty was reduced by an average of 31.8%, according to the RMSE, RSE, MAE and RAE values. Therefore, its application is recommended in Canada, where it would be useful for the Integrated Water Resources Management Program.",https://doi.org/10.1080/07011784.2017.1290552,10.1080/07011784.2017.1290552,"Escalante-Sandoval, Carlos; Amores-Rovelo, Leonardo",CANADIAN WATER RESOURCES JOURNAL,runoff forecast; regional ANN; homogeneous region; K-means; L-moments,ARTIFICIAL NEURAL-NETWORKS; STREAMFLOW; RIVER; CLASSIFICATION; FLOWS,,TAYLOR & FRANCIS INC,PHILADELPHIA,"530 WALNUT STREET, STE 850, PHILADELPHIA, PA 19106 USA",0701-1784,1918-1817,,CAN WATER RESOUR J,Can.

559,A dynamic river network method for the prediction of floods using a parsimonious rainfall-runoff model,"Floods are one of the major climate-related hazards and cause casualties and substantial damage. Accurate and timely flood forecasting and design flood estimation are important to protect lives and property. The Distance Distribution Dynamic (DDD) is a parsimonious rainfall-runoff model which is being used for flood forecasting at the Norwegian flood forecasting service. The model, like many other models, underestimates floods in many cases. To improve the flood peak prediction, we propose a dynamic river network method into the model. The method is applied for 15 catchments in Norway and tested on 91 flood peaks. The performance of DDD in terms of KGE and BIAS is identical with and without dynamic river network, but the relative error (RE) and mean absolute relative error (MARE) of the simulated flood peaks are improved significantly with the method. The 0.75 and 0.25 quantiles of the RE are reduced from 41% to 23% and from 22% to 1%, respectively. The MARE is reduced from 32.9% to 15.7%. The study results also show that the critical support area is smaller in steep and bare mountain catchments than flat and forested catchments.",https://doi.org/10.2166/nh.2019.003,10.2166/nh.2019.003,"Tsegaw, Aynalem Tassachew; Skaugen, Thomas; Alfredsen, Knut; Muthanna, Tone M.",HYDROLOGY RESEARCH,critical flux (FC); critical supporting area (AC); dynamic river network; floods,DRAINAGE DENSITY; CONTINUOUS SIMULATION; FREQUENCY ESTIMATION; SPATIAL VARIABILITY; UNCERTAINTY; STREAMFLOW,,IWA PUBLISHING,LONDON,"REPUBLIC-EXPORT BLDG, UNITS 1 04 & 1 05, 1 CLOVE CRESCENT, LONDON, ENGLAND",1998-9563,2224-7955,,HYDROL RES,Hydrol.

560,Hybrid particle swarm optimization with extreme learning machine for daily reference evapotranspiration prediction from limited climatic data,"Accurate prediction of reference evapotranspiration (ETo) is pivotal to the determination of crop water requirement and irrigation scheduling in agriculture as well as water resources management in hydrology. In the present study, the particle swarm optimization (PSO) algorithm was utilized to optimally determine the parameters of the extreme learning machine (ELM) model, and a novel hybrid PSO-ELM model was thus proposed for estimating daily ETo in the arid region of Northwest China with limited input data. The PSO-ELM model was compared with the original ELM, artificial neural networks (ANN) and random forests (RF) models as along with six empirical models (including radiation-, temperature- and mass transfer-based empirical models). Three input combinations were utilized to develop the data-driven models, which corresponded to the radiation-, temperature- and mass transfer-based models, respectively. The results indicated that machine learning models provided more accurate ETo estimates, compared with the corresponding empirical models with the same inputs. The hybrid PSO-ELM model exhibited better performance than the other models for daily ETo estimation as indicated by the statistical results. Although radiation-based machine learning models outperformed temperature- and mass transfer-based machine learning models, the temperature-based PSO-ELM model obtained reasonable results when only air temperature data were available, which was considered as a promising model for forecasting future ETo with temperature data. Overall, the PSO-ELM model was superior to the other machine learning and empirical models, which was thus recommended to predict daily ETo with limited inputs in the arid region of Northwest China.",https://doi.org/10.1016/j.compag.2020.105430,10.1016/j.compag.2020.105430,"Zhu, Bin; Feng, Yu; Gong, Daozhi; Jiang, Shouzheng; Zhao, Lu; Cui, Ningbo",COMPUTERS AND ELECTRONICS IN AGRICULTURE,Particle swarm optimization; Extreme learning machine; Random forests; Reference evapotranspiration; Modeling,MODELING REFERENCE EVAPOTRANSPIRATION; ARTIFICIAL NEURAL-NETWORK; REFERENCE CROP EVAPOTRANSPIRATION; GLOBAL SOLAR-RADIATION; PAN EVAPORATION; METEOROLOGICAL DATA; ARID REGIONS; TEMPERATURE; EQUATIONS; REGRESSION,,ELSEVIER SCI LTD,OXFORD,"THE BOULEVARD, LANGFORD LANE, KIDLINGTON, OXFORD OX5 1GB, OXON, ENGLAND",0168-1699,1872-7107,,COMPUT ELECTRON AGR,Comput.

561,A prediction on structural stress and deformation of fish cage in waves using machine-learning method,"Generally, the hydrodynamics of a fish cage are investigated using numerical simulation, physical model experiments, and field measurements. However, these traditional research methods are time consuming and low in efficiency. In this study, an artificial neural network (ANN) model is built such that the hydrodynamic characteristics of a fish cage in waves can be predicted rapidly. The training data of the ANN model are generated by a well-developed numerical model from our previous studies. The parameters in the hidden layer of the ANN model are determined considering the prediction accuracy of the hydrodynamic results of the fish cage. The ANN model is validated against a well-developed numerical model with satisfactory accuracy. Using the proposed ANN model, the hydrodynamic results of the fish cage including the maximum tension in mooring lines, minimum effective-volume ratio, and maximum stress of the floating collar are predicted for various waves. Overall, the predicted results indicate a trend consistent with that of the previous studies. The present model can potentially forecast disasters for an oncoming typhoon, which is important for the hazard prevention of a fish farm.",https://doi.org/10.1016/j.aquaeng.2019.01.003,10.1016/j.aquaeng.2019.01.003,"Zhao, Yun-Peng; Bi, Chun-Wei; Sun, Xiong-Xiong; Dong, Guo-Hai",AQUACULTURAL ENGINEERING,Fish cage; Hydrodynamics; Prediction; Artificial neural network (ANN),HYDRODYNAMIC BEHAVIOR; NUMERICAL-SIMULATION; GRAVITY CAGE; NET; DRAG; FORCES; SYSTEM; COLLAR; MODEL,,ELSEVIER SCI LTD,OXFORD,"THE BOULEVARD, LANGFORD LANE, KIDLINGTON, OXFORD OX5 1GB, OXON, ENGLAND",0144-8609,1873-5614,,AQUACULT ENG,Aquac.

562,Complex Assessment and Forecasting of Chemical Pollution of Small Rivers by Economic and Mathematical Modelling Methods,"The purpose of this work is to determine the hydrochemical parameters of the water of the river Seret and the features of the accumulation of heavy metals by bivalve molluscs Unio pictorum L. to predict the chemical contamination of the reservoir in the near future. Water samples for the study were taken in spring (April) and summer (July) from the Seret River at two points: above and below Ternopil. It is established that the chemical composition of the water of the river Seret is formed under the influence of a number of factors, but seasonal and anthropogenic factors play a dominant role. In the spring season, a number of hydrochemical indicators (pH, water hardness, concentration of NO2-, NH4+, Cl- ions and metals) have lower values than in the summer. In addition, there is an increase in the amount of organic matter, ammonium cations, nitrite ions, chloride ions, phosphate ions and a decrease in oxygen concentration below Ternopil, especially in the summer season. This is evidence that the Seret River is under significant anthropogenic impact. An increase in the concentration of metals (Mn, Cu and Pb) in summer below Ternopil was revealed, which may be due to the discharge of insufficiently treated wastewater. The series of metal concentrations in the water of the Seret River looks as follows Mn -> Zn -> Pb -> Cd -> Cu, and the series of accumulation of metals in the tissues of molluscs Unio pictorum L. has the form Zn. Mn. Cu. Pb. Cd. On the basis of bioaccumulation coefficients of heavy metals by molluscs, a prediction of the situation on their content in water for the short term based on the theory of Markov chains was made. This theory allows us to make forecasts of a factor, taking into account the possibility of accidental influences on the environment, and to investigate the highest probability of finding a factor in a certain numerical parameter. The possibility of using economic and mathematical modelling tools and statistical methods based on correlation-regression analysis using modern Matlab information systems to identify correlations between chemical indicators of water quality and biological molluscs for modelling the environmental situation of the river Seret and assessing the contribution of the studied indicators in pollution of small rivers is shown.",https://doi.org/10.15421/112142,10.15421/112142,"Humeniuk, Halyna B.; Khomenchuk, Volodymyr O.; Harmatiy, Nataliia M.; Chen, Iryna B.",JOURNAL OF GEOLOGY GEOGRAPHY AND GEOECOLOGY,small rivers; heavy metals; bivalve mollusc; prediction of bioaccumulation coefficients of metals; economic and mathematical modelling,ORGANIZATION,,OLES GONCHAR DNIPRO NATL UNIV,DNIPRO,"GEOLOGY & GEOGRAPHY DEPT, DMYTRO YAVOMITSKYI, 36, DNIPRO, 49066, UKRAINE",2617-2909,2617-2119,,J GEOL GEOGR GEOECOL,J.

563,A Flood Prediction Method Based on Streaming Big Data Processing,"The traditional computing methods based SCS (Soil Conservation Service) model is of low efficiency and does not satisfy timeliness of some engineering applications in large and medium scale basin flood forecast. The streaming big data processing has the characteristics of cluster nonlinearity, parallel processing and high-efficient computational capability. In this paper, improved SCS model for flood prediction method is proposed by integrating the streaming big data processing into the conventional SCS model. First, the large and middle scale basins is divided into several interconnected sub-basins. Second, basin runoff forecasting model is given based on iterative computing of sub-basin runoff forecast value. Finally, by adopting the streaming big data processing method, the runoff of the sub-basin is computed in parallel, and section runoff of sub basin is integrated, Flood forecasting in the whole basin is realized. To explain and verify the proposed method, four hydrological monitoring stations (Wuying, Yixin, Xlin and Chenming) are selected in Yichun river system of Tangwang River Basin divide the Yichun river system into 5 sub-basins. The proposed method for the basin flood forecasting are compared to traditional method for calculation by experiments. The experimental results show that the computational into the proposed model with streaming big data processing is nearly 4 times higher than that of the traditional model, and the overall computation time is shortened by about 73%.",https://doi.org/,,"Li, Chenming; Peng, Jianhua; Wang, Huibin; Yang, Simon X.",2017 IEEE INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE ON INFORMATION AND AUTOMATION (IEEE ICIA 2017),Flood prediction; runoff forecast; SCS model; big data; streaming calculation method,,,IEEE,NEW YORK,"345 E 47TH ST, NEW YORK, NY 10017 USA",,,978-1-5386-3154-6,,,,2017,,,898,902,,
564,Detecting the State of the Climate System via Artificial Intelligence to Improve Seasonal Forecasts and Inform Reservoir Operations,"Increasingly variable hydrologic regimes combined with more frequent and intense extreme events are challenging water systems management worldwide. These trends emphasize the need of accurate medium- to long-term predictions to timely prompt anticipatory operations. Despite in some locations global climate oscillations and particularly the El Nino Southern Oscillation (ENSO) may contribute to extending forecast lead times, in other regions there is no consensus on how ENSO can be detected, and used as local conditions are also influenced by other concurrent climate signals. In this work, we introduce the Climate State Intelligence framework to capture the state of multiple global climate signals via artificial intelligence and improve seasonal forecasts. These forecasts are used as additional inputs for informing water system operations and their value is quantified as the corresponding gain in system performance. We apply the framework to the Lake Como basin, a regulated lake in northern Italy mainly operated for flood control and irrigation supply. Numerical results show the existence of notable teleconnection patterns dependent on both ENSO and the North Atlantic Oscillation over the Alpine region, which contribute in generating skilful seasonal precipitation and hydrologic forecasts. The use of this information for conditioning the lake operations produces an average 44% improvement in system performance with respect to a baseline solution not informed by any forecast, with this gain that further increases during extreme drought episodes. Our results also suggest that observed preseason sea surface temperature anomalies appear more valuable than hydrologic-based seasonal forecasts, producing an average 59% improvement in system performance.",https://doi.org/10.1029/2019WR025035,10.1029/2019WR025035,"Giuliani, Matteo; Zaniolo, Marta; Castelletti, Andrea; Davoli, Guido; Block, Paul",WATER RESOURCES RESEARCH,optimal reservoir operations; seasonal forecast; climate teleconnections; artificial intelligence,NORTH-ATLANTIC OSCILLATION; RAINFALL PROBABILISTIC FORECASTS; WATER-SUPPLY MANAGEMENT; INTERANNUAL VARIABILITY; STREAMFLOW FORECASTS; ENSO; PRECIPITATION; RESOURCES; SCALE; NAO,,AMER GEOPHYSICAL UNION,WASHINGTON,"2000 FLORIDA AVE NW, WASHINGTON, DC 20009 USA",0043-1397,1944-7973,,WATER RESOUR RES,Water Resour.

565,Forecasting Zoonotic Infectious Disease Response to Climate Change: Mosquito Vectors and a Changing Environment,"Infectious diseases are changing due to the environment and altered interactions among hosts, reservoirs, vectors, and pathogens. This is particularly true for zoonotic diseases that infect humans, agricultural animals, and wildlife. Within the subset of zoonoses, vector-borne pathogens are changing more rapidly with climate change, and have a complex epidemiology, which may allow them to take advantage of a changing environment. Most mosquito-borne infectious diseases are transmitted by mosquitoes in three genera: Aedes, Anopheles, and Culex, and the expansion of these genera is well documented. There is an urgent need to study vector-borne diseases in response to climate change and to produce a generalizable approach capable of generating risk maps and forecasting outbreaks. Here, we provide a strategy for coupling climate and epidemiological models for zoonotic infectious diseases. We discuss the complexity and challenges of data and model fusion, baseline requirements for data, and animal and human population movement. Disease forecasting needs significant investment to build the infrastructure necessary to collect data about the environment, vectors, and hosts at all spatial and temporal resolutions. These investments can contribute to building a modeling community around the globe to support public health officials so as to reduce disease burden through forecasts with quantified uncertainty.",https://doi.org/10.3390/vetsci6020040,10.3390/vetsci6020040,"Bartlow, Andrew W.; Manore, Carrie; Xu, Chonggang; Kaufeld, Kimberly A.; Del Valle, Sara; Ziemann, Amanda; Fairchild, Geoffrey; Fair, Jeanne M.",VETERINARY SCIENCES,infectious disease; zoonotic; mosquito; vector-borne; climate change; range expansion; epidemiology,ANOPHELES-ARABIENSIS; ZIKA VIRUS; DENGUE TRANSMISSION; AEDES-ALBOPICTUS; CULEX-CORONATOR; GLOBAL RISK; MALARIA TRANSMISSION; EQUINE ENCEPHALITIS; DIPTERA-CULICIDAE; DRY SEASON,,MDPI,BASEL,"ST ALBAN-ANLAGE 66, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND",,2306-7381,,VET SCI,Vet.

566,"Hybrid forecasting model for non-stationary daily runoff series: A case study in the Han River Basin, China","Accurate and reliable short-term runoff prediction is of great significance to the management of water resources optimization and reservoir flood operation. In order to improve the accuracy of short-term runoff forecasting, a hybrid model-based feature decomposition-learning reconstruction named VMD-DBN-IPSO was proposed. In this paper, variational mode decomposition (VMD) is first used to decompose the original daily runoff series into a set of sub-sequence for improving the frequency resolution. Partial autocorrelation function (PACF) is then applied to determine the input variables of each sub-sequence. The improved particle swarm optimization (IPSO) algorithm is combined with the deep belief network (DBN) model to predict each sub-sequences and finally reconstruct the ensemble forecasting result. Three quantitative evaluation indicators, mean absolute error (MAE), root mean square error (RMSE) and Nash-Sutcliffe efficiency coefficient (NSE), were used to evaluate and compare the established models using the historical daily runoff data (1/1/1988-31/12/2017) at Yangxian and Ankang hydrological station in the Han River Basin of China. Meanwhile, a comparative analysis of the performance of VMD-DBN-IPSO model under different forecast periods (1-, 3-, 5- and 7-day lead time) was performed. In addition, the prediction ability of peak runoff of the VMD-DBN-IPSO model is further verified by analyzing the 10 peak flows during the testing data-series. The results indicate that the VMD-DBN-IPSO model can always achieve the best performance in the training and testing stage, and has good stability and representativeness, the NSE coefficient remains above 0.8, and the prediction error of peak flow is within 20%. It is a preferred data-driven tool for forecasting daily runoff.",https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jhydrol.2019.123915,10.1016/j.jhydrol.2019.123915,"Xie, Tuo; Zhang, Gang; Hou, Jinwang; Xie, Jiancang; Lv, Meng; Liu, Fuchao",JOURNAL OF HYDROLOGY,Daily runoff forecasting; Variational mode decomposition; Deep belief network; Improved particle swarm optimization algorithm; The Han River Basin,DEEP NEURAL-NETWORKS; MONTHLY STREAMFLOW; PROBABILISTIC PREDICTION; BELIEF NETWORK; ADAPTIVE NOISE; WIND-SPEED; DECOMPOSITION; PERFORMANCE; ALGORITHM; MACHINES,,ELSEVIER,AMSTERDAM,"RADARWEG 29, 1043 NX AMSTERDAM, NETHERLANDS",0022-1694,1879-2707,,J HYDROL,J.

567,Forecasting monthly fluctuations of lake surface areas using remote sensing techniques and novel machine learning methods,"Drought is one of the most environmentally impactful hydrologic processes with devastating economic consequences for many rural communities in arid and semi-arid countries all over the world. In this research, we have employed satellite data and a stochastic approach for forecasting the changes in lake surface areas and demonstrated for the application of the new technique for the case study of the Lake Gregory in Australia. High-resolution Landsat satellite images are used on a monthly time scale from Landsat 5, 7, and 8, on days that are not cloudy. The software ENVI 5.3, using normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI), and modify normalized difference water index (MNDWI) indices were employed to obtain the lake surface maps, and satellite images have been split into water and non-water using a decision tree. The ArcGIS 10.3 software was used to calculate the area of the Lake monthly. The overall trend data shows that from 2004 to 2019, the LS is steadily declining, reaching its lowest area in 2019.The TRMM satellite monthly precipitation (P) and temperature (T) measurement were obtained to investigate the correlation between these changes and regional precipitation. We developed a novel generalized group method of data handling (GGMDH) to forecast lake surface (LS) fluctuations, in which the LS time-series database is extracted from the satellite imagery. For downscaling, precipitation and three different scenarios are defined based on climate change projections to forecast the LS in the 2020-2060 period. The comparison of the GGMDH with stochastic models integrated with preprocessing scenarios indicates the GGMDH in long-term LS forecasting outperforms the stochastic model. The result showed GGMDH is the best model among other ones to modeling lake surface by R-2 (%) = 94.16, RMSE = 8.77 for the forecasting stage.

The artificial intelligence (AI) algorithm is generally used for stochastic forecasting rainfall which is not capable to simulate unseen extreme rainfall events which become common due to climate change. A new model is developed in this study for prediction of daily rainfall for different lead times based on sea level pressure (SLP) which is physically related to rainfall on land and thus able to predict unseen rainfall events. Daily rainfall of east coast of Peninsular Malaysia (PM) was predicted using SLP data over the climate domain. Five advanced AI algorithms such as extreme learning machine (ELM), Bayesian regularized neural networks (BRNNs), Bayesian additive regression trees (BART), extreme gradient boosting (xgBoost), and hybrid neural fuzzy inference system (HNFIS) were used considering the complex relationship of rainfall with sea level pressure. Principle components of SLP domain correlated with daily rainfall were used as predictors. The results revealed that the efficacy of AI models is predicting daily rainfall one day before. The relative performance of the models revealed the higher performance of BRNN with normalized root mean square error (NRMSE) of 0.678 compared with HNFIS (NRMSE = 0.708), BART (NRMSE = 0.784), xgBoost (NRMSE = 0.803), and ELM (NRMSE = 0.915). Visual inspection of predicted rainfall during model validation using density-scatter plot and other novel ways of visual comparison revealed the ability of BRNN to predict daily rainfall one day before reliably.",https://doi.org/10.1155/2021/6631564,10.1155/2021/6631564,"Ye, Lu; Jabbar, Saadya Fahad; Abdul Zahra, Musaddak M.; Tan, Mou Leong",COMPLEXITY,,,,WILEY-HINDAWI,LONDON,"ADAM HOUSE, 3RD FL, 1 FITZROY SQ, LONDON, WIT 5HE, ENGLAND",1076-2787,1099-0526,,COMPLEXITY,Complexity,APR 1,2021,2021,,,,6631564,
569,Discharge estimation and forecasting by MODIS and altimetry data in Niger-Benue River,"Flooding is one of the most devastating natural hazards in the world and its forecast is essential in flood risk reduction and disaster response decision. The lack of adequate monitoring networks, especially in developing countries prevents near real-time flood prediction that could help to reduce the loss of lives and economic damages. In the last few years, increasing availability of multi-satellite sensors induced to develop new techniques for retrieving river discharge and especially in supporting discharge nowcasting and forecasting activities. Recently, the potential of radar altimetry to estimate water levels and discharge in ungauged river sites with good accuracy has been demonstrated. However, the considerable benefit derived from this technique is attenuated by the low revisit time of the satellite (10 or 35 days, depending on the satellite mission) causing delays on the predicting operations. For this reason, sensors with a higher temporal resolution such as the MODerate resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS), working in visible/Infra-Red bands, can support flood forecasting. In this study, we performed the forecast of river discharge by using MODIS and we compared it with the radar altimetry and in-situ data along the Niger-Benue River in Nigeria to develop an operational flood forecasting scheme that could help in rapid emergency response and decision making processes. In the first step, four MODIS products (daily and, 8-day from the TERRA and AQUA satellites) at two gauged sites were used for discharge estimation. Secondly, the capability of remote sensing sensors to forecast discharge a few days (similar to 4 days) in advance at a downstream section using MODIS is analyzed and also compared with the one obtained by the use of radar altimetry by ENVISAT and Jason-2. The results confirmed the capability of the MODIS data to estimate river discharge with performance indices >0.97 and 0.95 in terms of coefficient of correlation and Nash Sutcliffe efficiency. In particular, RMSE does not exceed 1300 m(3)/s and the fractional RMSE ranges between 0.15 and 0.23. For the forecasting exercise, both altimetry and MODIS provide satisfactory results with positive coefficient of persistence considering 4 days of lead time (>0.34). Although altimetry was found to be more accurate in the forecasting of river discharge (RMSE similar to 350 m(3)/s), the much higher temporal resolution of MODIS guarantees a continuity that is more suitable to address operational activities.

570,Analysis and forecast of Pontic shad (Alosa immaculata) catch in the Danube River,"The relationship between the Lower Danube River level and Romanian annual catches of Pontic shad (Alosa immaculata, Bennett 1835) were analyzed. For analysis of long term data on the Danube River water level and Pontic shad catch, combinations of different methods were applied using statistical programs, SPSS 13.0 and MATLAB 6. Periodograms, containing cyclic patterns, were obtained using Fourier analysis. Significant oscillations were determined with Fisher-Whittle' s tests and residuals were calculated after subtracting these significant oscillations from the original signals. Autoregressive moving average (ARMA) models of residuals were finally applied. Results indicated that river water levels, and especially those in May, greatly explained the fluctuations of Pontic shad catch. Annual landings varied greatly and appeared to be cyclic. Varying river flow was considered to be one of the most important factors that cause fluctuations in the size of populations. Forecast indicates gradual increase of the catch in the next decade, followed by a decrease in other decades. Estimated as a vulnerable species of fish by the IUCN, development of the forecasting model of the future catch oscillations could be very helpful to regulate fishing efforts towards the sustainable use of stocks and species conservation.",https://doi.org/10.22092/IJFS.2018.116611,10.22092/IJFS.2018.116611,"Smederevac-Lalic, M.; Kalauzi, A.; Regner, S.; Navodaru, I.; Visnjic-Jeftic, Z.; Gacic, Z.; Lenhardt, M.",IRANIAN JOURNAL OF FISHERIES SCIENCES,Fish catch; Water level; Oscillations; Model; Prediction,SOLAR-ACTIVITY; CLIMATE-CHANGE; BLACK-SEA; MODEL,,IRANIAN FISHERIES SCIENCE RESEARCH INST-IFSRI,TEHRAN,"IRANIAN FISH SCI RES INST,TEHRAN-KARAJ HWY, EXIT PAYKAN SHAHR, SARVENAZ AVE, SARVE AZAD AVE, W 8 ST, TEHRAN, 00000, IRAN",1562-2916,,,IRAN J FISH SCI,Iran.

571,"A Multiscale, Hydrometeorological Forecast Evaluation of National Water Model Forecasts of the May 2018 Ellicott City, Maryland, Flood","The NOAA National Water Model (NWM) became operational in August 2016, producing the first ever real-time, distributed, continuous set of hydrologic forecasts over the continental United States (CONUS). This project uses integrated hydrometeorological assessment methods to investigate the utility of the NWM to predict catastrophic flooding associated with an extreme rainfall event that occurred in Ellicott City, Maryland, on 27-28 May 2018. Short-range forecasts (0-18-h lead time) from the NWM version 1.2 are explored, focusing on the quantitative precipitation forecast (QPF) forcing from the High-Resolution Rapid Refresh (HRRR) model and the corresponding NWM streamflow forecast. A comprehensive assessment of multiscale hydrometeorological processes are considered using a combination of object-based, grid-based, and hydrologic point-based verification. Results highlight the benefits and risks of using a distributed hydrologic modeling tool such as the NWM to connect operational CONUS-scale atmospheric forcings to local impact predictions. For the Ellicott City event, reasonably skillful QPF in several HRRR model forecast cycles produced NWM streamflow forecasts in the small Ellicott City basin that were suggestive of flash flood potential. In larger surrounding basins, the NWM streamflow response was more complex, and errors were found to be governed by both hydrologic process representation, as well as forcing errors. The integrated, hydrometeorological multiscale analysis method demonstrated here guides both research and ongoing model development efforts, along with providing user education and engagement to ultimately engender improved flash flood prediction.",https://doi.org/10.1175/JHM-D-19-0125.1,10.1175/JHM-D-19-0125.1,"Viterbo, Francesca; Mahoney, Kelly; Read, Laura; Salas, Fernando; Bates, Bradford; Elliott, Jason; Cosgrove, Brian; Dugger, Aubrey; Gochis, David; Cifelli, Robert",JOURNAL OF HYDROMETEOROLOGY,,LAND-COVER DATABASE; UNITED-STATES; PRECIPITATION; PRODUCT; HAND,,AMER METEOROLOGICAL SOC,BOSTON,"45 BEACON ST, BOSTON, MA 02108-3693 USA",1525-755X,1525-7541,,J HYDROMETEOROL,J.

572,Impact of the quality of hydrological forecasts on the management and revenue of hydroelectric reservoirs - a conceptual approach,"The improvement of a forecasting system and the continuous evaluation of its quality are recurrent steps in operational practice. However, the systematic evaluation of forecast value or usefulness for better decision-making is less frequent, even if it is also essential to guide strategic planning and investments. In the hydropower sector, several operational systems use medium-range hydrometeorological forecasts (up to 7-10 d ahead) and energy price predictions as input to models that optimize hydropower production. The operation of hydropower systems, including the management of water stored in reservoirs, is thus partially impacted by weather and hydrological conditions. Forecast value can be quantified by the economic gains obtained with the optimization of operations informed by the forecasts. In order to assess how much improving the quality of hydrometeorological forecasts will improve their economic value, it is essential to understand how the system and its optimization model are sensitive to sequences of input forecasts of different quality. This paper investigates the impact of 7 d streamflow forecasts of different quality on the management of hydroelectric reservoirs and the economic gains generated from a linear programming optimization model. The study is based on a conceptual approach. Flows from 10 catchments in France are synthetically generated over a 4-year period to obtain forecasts of different quality in terms of accuracy and reliability. These forecasts define the inflows to 10 hydroelectric reservoirs, which are conceptually parameterized. Relationships between forecast quality and economic value (hydropower revenue) show that forecasts with a recurrent positive bias (overestimation) and low accuracy generate the highest economic losses when compared to the reference management system where forecasts are equal to observed inflows. The smallest losses are observed for forecast systems with underdispersion reliability bias, while forecast systems with negative bias (underestimation) show intermediate losses. Overall, the losses (which amount to millions of Euros) represent approximately 1% to 3% of the revenue over the study period. Besides revenue, the quality of the forecasts also impacts spillage, stock evolution, production hours and production rates, with systematic over- and underestimations being able to generate some extreme reservoir management situations.",https://doi.org/10.5194/hess-25-1033-2021,10.5194/hess-25-1033-2021,"Cassagnole, Manon; Ramos, Maria-Helena; Zalachori, Ioanna; Thirel, Guillaume; Garcon, Remy; Gailhard, Joel; Ouillon, Thomas",HYDROLOGY AND EARTH SYSTEM SCIENCES,,ENSEMBLE PREDICTION; ECONOMIC VALUE; PROBABILISTIC FORECASTS; HYDROPOWER SYSTEM; DECISION-MAKING; OPTIMIZATION; STREAMFLOW; INFORMATION; MODELS; SKILL,,COPERNICUS GESELLSCHAFT MBH,GOTTINGEN,"BAHNHOFSALLEE 1E, GOTTINGEN, 37081, GERMANY",1027-5606,1607-7938,,HYDROL EARTH SYST SC,Hydrol.

573,Benefits of machine learning and sampling frequency on phytoplankton bloom forecasts in coastal areas,"In aquatic ecosystems, anthropogenic activities disrupt nutrient fluxes, thereby promoting harmful algal blooms that could directly impact economies and human health. Within this framework, the forecasting of the proxy of chlorophyll a in coastal areas is the first step to managing these algal blooms. The primary goal was to analyze how phytoplankton bloom forecasts are impacted by different sampling frequencies, by using a machine learning model. The database used in this study was sourced from an automated system located in the English Channel. This device has a sampling frequency of 20 min. We considered 12 physicochemical parameters over a six-year period. Our forecast methodology is based on the random forest (RF) model and a sliding window strategy. The lag times for these sliding windows ranged from 12 h to 3 months with four different sampling times until 1 day. The results indicate that the optimal forecast was obtained for a 20 min time step, with an average R-2 of 0.62. Moreover, the highest values of fluorescence were predicted when the water temperature was approximately 11.8 degrees C. Consequently, we demonstrated that the sampling frequency directly impacts the forecast performance of an RF model. Furthermore, this kind of model can recreate interactions that closely resemble biological processes. Our study suggests that the RF model can utilize the additional information contained in high-frequency datasets. The methodology presented here lays the foundation for the development of a numerical decision-making tool that could help mitigate the impact of these algal blooms.",https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ecoinf.2020.101174,10.1016/j.ecoinf.2020.101174,"Derot, Jonathan; Yajima, Hiroshi; Schmitt, Francois G.",ECOLOGICAL INFORMATICS,Algal bloom; Autonomous monitoring; English Channel; Random Forest model; Individual conditional expectation plots; Water quality management,HARMFUL ALGAL BLOOMS; TEMPERATURE TIME-SERIES; ENGLISH-CHANNEL; DISSOLVED-OXYGEN; WATER; DYNAMICS; EUTROPHICATION; CYANOBACTERIA; EASTERN; PREDICTION,,ELSEVIER,AMSTERDAM,"RADARWEG 29, 1043 NX AMSTERDAM, NETHERLANDS",1574-9541,1878-0512,,ECOL INFORM,Ecol.

574,Two-stage variational mode decomposition and support vector regression for streamflow forecasting,"Streamflow forecasting is a crucial component in the management and control of water resources. Decomposition-based approaches have particularly demonstrated improved forecasting performance. However, direct decomposition of entire streamflow data with calibration and validation subsets is not practical for signal component prediction. This impracticality is due to the fact that the calibration process uses some validation information that is not available in practical streamflow forecasting. Unfortunately, independent decomposition of calibration and validation sets leads to undesirable boundary effects and less accurate forecasting. To alleviate such boundary effects and improve the forecasting performance in basins lacking meteorological observations, we propose a two-stage decomposition prediction (TSDP) framework. We realize this framework using variational mode decomposition (VMD) and support vector regression (SVR) and refer to this realization as VMD-SVR. We demonstrate experimentally the effectiveness, efficiency and accuracy of the TSDP framework and its VMD-SVR realization in terms of the boundary effect reduction, computational cost, and overfitting, in addition to decomposition and forecasting outcomes for different lead times. Specifically, four comparative experiments were conducted based on the ensemble empirical mode decomposition (EEMD), singular spectrum analysis (SSA), discrete wavelet transform (DWT), boundary-corrected maximal overlap discrete wavelet transform (BCMODWT), autoregressive integrated moving average (ARIMA), SVR, backpropagation neural network (BPNN) and long short-term memory (LSTM). The TSDP framework was also compared with the wavelet data-driven forecasting framework (WDDFF). Results of experiments on monthly runoff data collected from three stations at the Wei River show the superiority of the VMD-SVR model compared to benchmark models.",https://doi.org/10.5194/hess-24-5491-2020,10.5194/hess-24-5491-2020,"Zuo, Ganggang; Luo, Jungang; Wang, Ni; Lian, Yani; He, Xinxin",HYDROLOGY AND EARTH SYSTEM SCIENCES,,ARTIFICIAL NEURAL-NETWORK; WEI RIVER-BASIN; HYBRID MODEL; WAVELET TRANSFORM; INCORRECT USAGE; RUNOFF; FLOW; PREDICTION; HYDROLOGY; MACHINE,,COPERNICUS GESELLSCHAFT MBH,GOTTINGEN,"BAHNHOFSALLEE 1E, GOTTINGEN, 37081, GERMANY",1027-5606,1607-7938,,HYDROL EARTH SYST SC,Hydrol.

575,"Mapping and Forecasting Onsets of Harmful Algal Blooms Using MODIS Data over Coastal Waters Surrounding Charlotte County, Florida","Over the past two decades, persistent occurrences of harmful algal blooms (HAB; Karenia brevis) have been reported in Charlotte County, southwestern Florida. We developed data-driven models that rely on spatiotemporal remote sensing and field data to identify factors controlling HAB propagation, provide a same-day distribution (nowcasting), and forecast their occurrences up to three days in advance. We constructed multivariate regression models using historical HAB occurrences (213 events reported from January 2010 to October 2017) compiled by the Florida Fish and Wildlife Conservation Commission and validated the models against a subset (20%) of the historical events. The models were designed to capture the onset of the HABs instead of those that developed days earlier and continued thereafter. A prototype of an early warning system was developed through a threefold exercise. The first step involved the automatic downloading and processing of daily Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) Aqua products using SeaDAS ocean color processing software to extract temporal and spatial variations of remote sensing-based variables over the study area. The second step involved the development of a multivariate regression model for same-day mapping of HABs and similar subsequent models for forecasting HAB occurrences one, two, and three days in advance. Eleven remote sensing variables and two non-remote sensing variables were used as inputs for the generated models. In the third and final step, model outputs (same-day and forecasted distribution of HABs) were posted automatically on a web map. Our findings include: (1) the variables most indicative of the timing of bloom propagation are bathymetry, euphotic depth, wind direction, sea surface temperature (SST), ocean chlorophyll three-band algorithm for MODIS [chlorophyll-a OC3M] and distance from the river mouth, and (2) the model predictions were 90% successful for same-day mapping and 65%, 72% and 71% for the one-, two- and three-day advance predictions, respectively. The adopted methodologies are reliable at a local scale, dependent on readily available remote sensing data, and cost-effective and thus could potentially be used to map and forecast algal bloom occurrences in data-scarce regions.",https://doi.org/10.3390/rs10101656,10.3390/rs10101656,"Karki, Sita; Sultan, Mohamed; Elkadiri, Racha; Elbayoumi, Tamer",REMOTE SENSING,Karenia brevis; harmful algal bloom (HAB); moderate resolution imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS); prediction; chlorophyll-a; multivariate regression,OCEAN COLOR SENSORS; DINOFLAGELLATE GYMNODINIUM-BREVE; DIFFUSE ATTENUATION COEFFICIENT; KARENIA-MIKIMOTOI BLOOM; SOUTH CHINA SEA; GULF-OF-MEXICO; CHLOROPHYLL FLUORESCENCE; PHYTOPLANKTON BLOOMS; WEST-COAST; RED-TIDE,,MDPI,BASEL,"ST ALBAN-ANLAGE 66, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND",2072-4292,,,REMOTE SENS-BASEL,Remote Sens.,OCT,2018,10,10,,,1656,
576,Groundwater Quality Assessment and Prediction of Spatial Variations in the Area of the Danube River Basin (Serbia),"Monitoring and forecasting of chemical and physicochemical parameters of groundwater is an important factor in quality control and water management. In order to optimize these processes, the initial purpose of this paper was to identify sources of pollution and predict spatial changes in groundwater quality. Patterns of spatial changes in groundwater quality in the Danube river basin (Serbia) have been identified using multivariate statistical techniques. The results of the applied cluster analysis are the indicators of the existance of two spatial clusters. The principal component/factor analysis (PCA/FA) has shown that beside natural, anthropogenic factor has an influence in spatial grouping. Discriminant analysis (DA) was applied in order to identify discriminant groundwater quality parameters. DA reduced the number of data by extracting two parameters (iron and arsenic). The spatial distribution of identified dominant factors and discriminant parameters were graphically represented using GIS. Finally, the artificial neural network technique was used to test the ability to predict spatial changes in the values of discriminant parameters, and the reliability of this technique to predict the spatial variations of the two extracted variables has been proven.",https://doi.org/10.1007/s11270-021-05069-4,10.1007/s11270-021-05069-4,"Ilic, Ivana; Puharic, Mirjana; Ilic, Dejan",WATER AIR AND SOIL POLLUTION,Groundwater quality; Danube river basin; Multivariate statistical techniques; Geographic Information System (GIS); Artificial neural network (ANN),,,SPRINGER INTERNATIONAL PUBLISHING AG,CHAM,"GEWERBESTRASSE 11, CHAM, CH-6330, SWITZERLAND",0049-6979,1573-2932,,WATER AIR SOIL POLL,Water Air Soil Pollut.,MAR 6,2021,232,3,,,117,
577,Large-watershed flood forecasting with high-resolution distributed hydrological model,"A distributed hydrological model has been successfully used in small-watershed flood forecasting, but there are still challenges for the application in a large watershed, one of them being the model's spatial resolution effect. To cope with this challenge, two efforts could be made; one is to improve the model's computation efficiency in a large watershed, the other is implementing the model on a highperformance supercomputer. This study sets up a physically based distributed hydrological model for flood forecasting of the Liujiang River basin in south China. Terrain data digital elevation model (DEM), soil and land use are downloaded from the website freely, and the model structure with a high resolution of 200m x 200m grid cell is set up. The initial model parameters are derived from the terrain property data, and then optimized by using the Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) algorithm; the model is used to simulate 29 observed flood events. It has been found that by dividing the river channels into virtual channel sections and assuming the cross section shapes as trapezoid, the Liuxihe model largely increases computation efficiency while keeping good model performance, thus making it applicable in larger watersheds. This study also finds that parameter uncertainty exists for physically deriving model parameters, and parameter optimization could reduce this uncertainty, and is highly recommended. Computation time needed for running a distributed hydrological model increases exponentially at a power of 2, not linearly with the increasing of model spatial resolution, and the 200m x 200m model resolution is proposed for modeling the Liujiang River basin flood with the Liuxihe model in this study. To keep the model with an acceptable performance, minimum model spatial resolution is needed. The suggested threshold model spatial resolution for modeling the Liujiang River basin flood is a 500m x 500m grid cell, but the model spatial resolution with a 200m x 200m grid cell is recommended in this study to keep the model at a better performance.",https://doi.org/10.5194/hess-21-735-2017,10.5194/hess-21-735-2017,"Chen, Yangbo; Li, Ji; Wang, Huanyu; Qin, Jianming; Dong, Liming",HYDROLOGY AND EARTH SYSTEM SCIENCES,,COVER CHARACTERISTICS DATABASE; ALERT SYSTEM; SURFACE; RIVER; CALIBRATION; RUNOFF; URBANIZATION; EUROPEEN; SHE,,COPERNICUS GESELLSCHAFT MBH,GOTTINGEN,"BAHNHOFSALLEE 1E, GOTTINGEN, 37081, GERMANY",1027-5606,1607-7938,,HYDROL EARTH SYST SC,Hydrol.

Herein, we compare 11 stochastic and 9 ML methods regarding their multi-step ahead forecasting properties by conducting 12 extensive computational experiments based on simulations. Each of these experiments uses 2000 time series generated by linear stationary stochastic processes. We conduct each simulation experiment twice; the first time using time series of 100 values and the second time using time series of 300 values.

579,On the Joint Calibration of Multivariate Seasonal Climate Forecasts from GCMs,"Multivariate seasonal climate forecasts are increasingly required for quantitative modeling in support of natural resources management and agriculture. GCM forecasts typically require postprocessing to reduce biases and improve reliability; however, current seasonal postprocessing methods often ignore multivariate dependence. In low-dimensional settings, fully parametric methods may sufficiently model intervariable covariance. On the other hand, empirical ensemble reordering techniques can inject desired multivariate dependence in ensembles from template data after univariate postprocessing. To investigate the best approach for seasonal forecasting, this study develops and tests several strategies for calibrating seasonal GCM forecasts of rainfall, minimum temperature, and maximum temperature with intervariable dependence: 1) simultaneous calibration of multiple climate variables using the Bayesian joint probability modeling approach; 2) univariate BJP calibration coupled with an ensemble reordering method (the Schaake shuffle); and 3) transformation-based quantile mapping, which borrows intervariable dependence from the raw forecasts. Applied to Australian seasonal forecasts from the ECMWF System4 model, univariate calibration paired with empirical ensemble reordering performs best in terms of univariate and multivariate forecast verification metrics, including the energy and variogram scores. However, the performance of empirical ensemble reordering using the Schaake shuffle is influenced by the selection of historical data in constructing a dependence template. Direct multivariate calibration is the second-best method, with its far superior performance in in-sample testing vanishing in cross validation, likely because of insufficient data relative to the number of parameters. The continued development of multivariate forecast calibration methods will support the uptake of seasonal climate forecasts in complex application domains such as agriculture and hydrology.",https://doi.org/10.1175/MWR-D-19-0046.1,10.1175/MWR-D-19-0046.1,"Schepen, Andrew; Everingham, Yvette; Wang, Quan J.",MONTHLY WEATHER REVIEW,Bayesian methods; Forecast verification; skill; Hindcasts; Seasonal forecasting; General circulation models; Model output statistics,MODEL OUTPUT STATISTICS; PROPER SCORING RULES; SCHAAKE SHUFFLE; PROBABILISTIC FORECASTS; RAINFALL FORECASTS; BIAS CORRECTION; PREDICTION; PRECIPITATION; TEMPERATURE; SIMULATION,,AMER METEOROLOGICAL SOC,BOSTON,"45 BEACON ST, BOSTON, MA 02108-3693 USA",0027-0644,1520-0493,,MON WEATHER REV,Mon.

581,"Deep Learning Forecasts of Soil Moisture: Convolutional Neural Network and Gated Recurrent Unit Models Coupled with Satellite-Derived MODIS, Observations and Synoptic-Scale Climate Index Data","Remotely sensed soil moisture forecasting through satellite-based sensors to estimate the future state of the underlying soils plays a critical role in planning and managing water resources and sustainable agricultural practices. In this paper, Deep Learning (DL) hybrid models (i.e., CEEMDAN-CNN-GRU) are designed for daily time-step surface soil moisture (SSM) forecasts, employing the gated recurrent unit (GRU), complete ensemble empirical mode decomposition with adaptive noise (CEEMDAN), and convolutional neural network (CNN). To establish the objective model's viability for SSM forecasting at multi-step daily horizons, the hybrid CEEMDAN-CNN-GRU model is tested at 1st, 5th, 7th, 14th, 21st, and 30th day ahead period by assimilating a comprehensive pool of 52 predictor dataset obtained from three distinct data sources. Data comprise satellite-derived Global Land Data Assimilation System (GLDAS) repository a global, high-temporal resolution, unique terrestrial modelling system, and ground-based variables from Scientific Information Landowners (SILO) and synoptic-scale climate indices. The results demonstrate the forecasting capability of the hybrid CEEMDAN-CNN-GRU model with respect to the counterpart comparative models. This is supported by a relatively lower value of the mean absolute percentage and root mean square error. In terms of the statistical score metrics and infographics employed to test the final model's utility, the proposed CEEMDAN-CNN-GRU models are considerably superior compared to a standalone and other hybrid method tested on independent SSM data developed through feature selection approaches.

It is impossible to extend the lead time of flood forecasting by solely using rain gauge observations. However, the weather research and forecasting (WRF) model has the potential to produce quantitative precipitation forecasts that can facilitate the flood risk management by increasing the flood forecasting lead time. This study investigates the flood prediction capabilities of the well-tested Grid-Xinanjiang model (GXM) in a flood-prone area, located in the upper region of the Huaihe River Basin, when driven by gauge observations and WRF precipitation forecasts, respectively. The results indicate that GXM is capable of producing improved flood predictions by using the WRF precipitation forecasts. The incoming floods are difficult to be predicted in advance by using the gauge-measured precipitation, especially when the lead time is larger than the flow concentration time. However, with the WRF forecasts, the occurrence of flood events can be predicted for longer lead times. This study also demonstrates that the temporal and spatial patterns of precipitation forecasts have an important impact on the prediction of both timing and magnitude of incoming floods.",https://doi.org/10.1111/jfr3.12544,10.1111/jfr3.12544,"Yao, Cheng; Ye, Jinyin; He, Zhixin; Bastola, Satish; Zhang, Ke; Li, Zhijia",JOURNAL OF FLOOD RISK MANAGEMENT,flood defence measures; forecasting and warning; hydrological modelling; precipitation,DATA ASSIMILATION; EXTREME FLOODS; SYSTEM; WRF; SATELLITE; FRAMEWORK; TIME; QPF,,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",1753-318X,,,J FLOOD RISK MANAG,J.

583,"The value and skill of seasonal forecasts for water resources management in the Upper Santa Cruz River basin, southern Arizona","The potential for adaptive water resources management based on seasonal forecasts in the arid Upper Santa Cruz River, southern Arizona was examined. We demonstrated that seasonal forecasts can be used to optimize water resources management and increase supply. Using El Nino Southern Oscillation (ENSO) to forecast the wet seasons (winter and summer) can provide information during extreme ENSO. We found that ENSO is a better indicator for dryer than normal winters during La Nina and dryer than normal summers during El Nino. As in indicator of wetter than normal seasons (i.e. El Nino and La Nina in the winter and summer, respectively) ENSO is often not a consistent predictor and moreover, on several occasions the wetter than normal rainfall did not yield above normal seasonal flows. We also examined the seasonal precipitation forecasts for the region from the Climate Forecast System (CFS). The CFS showed reasonable predictive skill for the winter that extends up to four months lead-time. The only CFS skill for forecasting summer rainfall was observed for predicting above normal rainfall in July with one month lead-time. Seasonal forecasts can substantially improve water resources management but currently requires considerations of large uncertainties in the operationally available forecasts. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

584,Streamflow and rainfall forecasting by two long short-term memory-based models,"Prediction of streamflow and rainfall is important for water resources planning and management. In this study, we developed two hybrid models, based on long short-term memory network (LSTM), for monthly streamflow and rainfall forecasting. One model, wavelet-LSTM (namely, WLSTM), applied a trous algorithm of wavelet transform to do series decomposition, and the other, convolutional LSTM (namely, CLSTM), coupled convolutional neural network to extract temporal features. Two streamflow datasets and two rainfall datasets are used to evaluate the proposed models. The prediction accuracy of WLSTM and CLSTM was compared with that of multilayer perceptron (MLP) and LSTM. Results indicated that LSTM was applicable for time series prediction, but WLSTM and CLSTM were superior alternatives.",https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jhydrol.2019.124296,10.1016/j.jhydrol.2019.124296,"Ni, Lingling; Wang, Dong; Singh, Vijay P.; Wu, Jianfeng; Wang, Yuankun; Tao, Yuwei; Zhang, Jianyun",JOURNAL OF HYDROLOGY,Long short-term memory; Wavelet transform; Convolutional layers; Hydrometeorological variables prediction,ARTIFICIAL-INTELLIGENCE; WATER-RESOURCES; NEURAL-NETWORKS; WAVELET; PRECIPITATION; DECOMPOSITION; CHINA,,ELSEVIER,AMSTERDAM,"RADARWEG 29, 1043 NX AMSTERDAM, NETHERLANDS",0022-1694,1879-2707,,J HYDROL,J.

585,Data Assimilation for Rainfall-Runoff Prediction Based on Coupled Atmospheric-Hydrologic Systems with Variable Complexity,"The data assimilation technique is an effective method for reducing initial condition errors in numerical weather prediction (NWP) models. This paper evaluated the potential of the weather research and forecasting (WRF) model and its three-dimensional data assimilation (3DVar) module in improving the accuracy of rainfall-runoff prediction through coupled atmospheric-hydrologic systems. The WRF model with the assimilation of radar reflectivity and conventional surface and upper-air observations provided the improved initial and boundary conditions for the hydrological process; subsequently, three atmospheric-hydrological systems with variable complexity were established by coupling WRF with a lumped, a grid-based Hebei model, and the WRF-Hydro modeling system. Four storm events with different spatial and temporal rainfall distribution from mountainous catchments of northern China were chosen as the study objects. The assimilation results showed a general improvement in the accuracy of rainfall accumulation, with low root mean square error and high correlation coefficients compared to the results without assimilation. The coupled atmospheric-hydrologic systems also provide more accurate flood forecasts, which depend upon the complexity of the coupled hydrological models. The grid-based Hebei system provided the most stable forecasts regardless of whether homogeneous or inhomogeneous rainfall was considered. Flood peaks before assimilation were underestimated more in the lumped Hebei model relative to the other coupling systems considered, and the model seems more applicable for homogeneous temporal and spatial events. WRF-Hydro did not exhibit desirable predictions of rapid flood process recession. This may reflect increasing infiltration due to the interaction of atmospheric and land surface hydrology at each integration, resulting in mismatched solutions for local runoff generation and confluence.",https://doi.org/10.3390/rs13040595,10.3390/rs13040595,"Wang, Wei; Liu, Jia; Li, Chuanzhe; Liu, Yuchen; Yu, Fuliang",REMOTE SENSING,WRF-3DVar data assimilation; coupled atmospheric-hydrologic system; rainfall-runoff prediction; lumped Hebei model; grid-based Hebei model; WRF-Hydro modeling system,,,MDPI,BASEL,"ST ALBAN-ANLAGE 66, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND",,2072-4292,,REMOTE SENS-BASEL,Remote Sens.,FEB,2021,13,4,,,595,
586,Towards an efficient storm surge and inundation forecasting system over the Bengal delta: chasing the Supercyclone Amphan,"The Bay of Bengal is a well-known breeding ground to some of the deadliest cyclones in history. Despite recent advancements, the complex morphology and hydrodynamics of this large delta and the associated modelling complexity impede accurate storm surge forecasting in this highly vulnerable region. Here we present a proof of concept of a physically consistent and computationally efficient storm surge forecasting system tractable in real time with limited resources. With a state-of-the-art wave-coupled hydrodynamic numerical modelling system, we forecast the recent Supercyclone Amphan in real time. From the available observations, we assessed the quality of our modelling framework. We affirmed the evidence of the key ingredients needed for an efficient, real-time surge and inundation forecast along this active and complex coastal region. This article shows the proof of the maturity of our framework for operational implementation, which can particularly improve the quality of localized forecast for effective decision-making over the Bengal delta shorelines as well as over other similar cyclone-prone regions.",https://doi.org/10.5194/nhess-21-2523-2021,10.5194/nhess-21-2523-2021,"Khan, Md Jamal Uddin; Durand, Fabien; Bertin, Xavier; Testut, Laurent; Krien, Yann; Islam, A.

587,Statistical forecast of seasonal discharge in Central Asia using observational records: development of a generic linear modelling tool for operational water resource management,"The semi-arid regions of Central Asia crucially depend on the water resources supplied by the mountainous areas of the Tien Shan and Pamir and Altai mountains. During the summer months the snow-melt-and glacier-melt-dominated river discharge originating in the mountains provides the main water resource available for agricultural production, but also for storage in reservoirs for energy generation during the winter months. Thus a reliable seasonal forecast of the water resources is crucial for sustainable management and planning of water resources. In fact, seasonal forecasts are mandatory tasks of all national hydro-meteorological services in the region. In order to support the operational seasonal forecast procedures of hydro-meteorological services, this study aims to develop a generic tool for deriving statistical forecast models of seasonal river discharge based solely on observational records. The generic model structure is kept as simple as possible in order to be driven by meteorological and hydrological data readily available at the hydro-meteorological services, and to be applicable for all catchments in the region. As snow melt dominates summer runoff, the main meteorological predictors for the forecast models are monthly values of winter precipitation and temperature, satellite-based snow cover data, and antecedent discharge. This basic predictor set was further extended by multi-monthly means of the individual predictors, as well as composites of the predictors. Forecast models are derived based on these predictors as linear combinations of up to four predictors. A user-selectable number of the best models is extracted automatically by the developed model fitting algorithm, which includes a test for robustness by a leave-one-out cross-validation. Based on the cross-validation the predictive uncertainty was quantified for every prediction model. Forecasts of the mean seasonal discharge of the period April to September are derived every month from January until June. The application of the model for several catchments in Central Asia - ranging from small to the largest rivers (240 to 290 000 km(2) catchment area) for the period 2000-2015 provided skilful forecasts for most catchments already in January, with adjusted R-2 values of the best model in the range of 0.6-0.8 for most of the catchments. The skill of the prediction increased every following month, i.e. with reduced lead time, with adjusted R-2 values usually in the range 0.8-0.9 for the best and 0.7-0.8 on average for the set of models in April just before the prediction period. The later forecasts in May and June improve further due to the high predictive power of the discharge in the first 2 months of the snow melt period. The improved skill of the set of forecast models with decreasing lead time resulted in narrow predictive uncertainty bands at the beginning of the snow melt period. In summary, the proposed generic automatic forecast model development tool provides robust predictions for seasonal water availability in Central Asia, which will be tested against the official forecasts in the upcoming years, with the vision of operational implementation.",https://doi.org/10.5194/hess-22-2225-2018,10.5194/hess-22-2225-2018,"Apel, Heiko; Abdykerimova, Zharkinay; Agalhanova, Marina; Baimaganbetov, Azamat; Gavrilenko, Nadejda; Gerlitz, Lars; Kalashnikova, Olga; Unger-Shayesteh, Katy; Vorogushyn, Sergiy; Gafurov, Abror",HYDROLOGY AND EARTH SYSTEM SCIENCES,,PRECIPITATION CLIMATE; DOMINATED CATCHMENTS; METEOROLOGICAL DATA; TARIM RIVER; RUNOFF; SNOW; MELT; PREDICTABILITY; GLACIERS; BASIN,,COPERNICUS GESELLSCHAFT MBH,GOTTINGEN,"BAHNHOFSALLEE 1E, GOTTINGEN, 37081, GERMANY",1027-5606,1607-7938,,HYDROL EARTH SYST SC,Hydrol.

588,The multi temporal/multi-model approach to predictive uncertainty assessment in real-time flood forecasting,"This work extends the multi-temporal approach of the Model Conditional Processor (MCP-MT) to the multi-model case and to the four Truncated Normal Distributions (TNDs) approach, demonstrating the improvement on the single-temporal one. The study is framed in the context of probabilistic Bayesian decision-making that is appropriate to take rational decisions on uncertain future outcomes. As opposed to the direct use of deterministic forecasts, the probabilistic forecast identifies a predictive probability density function that represents a fundamental knowledge on future occurrences. The added value of MCP-MT is the identification of the probability that a critical situation will happen within the forecast lead-time and when, more likely, it will occur. MCP-MT is thoroughly tested for both single-model and multi-model configurations at a gauged site on the Tiber River, central Italy. The stages forecasted by two operative deterministic models, STAFOM-RCM and MISDc, are considered for the study. The dataset used for the analysis consists of hourly data from 34 flood events selected on a time series of six years. MCP-MT improves over the original models' forecasts: the peak overestimation and the rising limb delayed forecast, characterizing MISDc and STAFOM-RCM respectively, are significantly mitigated, with a reduced mean error on peak stage from 45 to 5 cm and an increased coefficient of persistence from 0.53 up to 0.75. The results show that MCP-MT outperforms the single-temporal approach and is potentially useful for supporting decision-making because the exceedance probability of hydrometric thresholds within a forecast horizon and the most probable flooding time can be estimated.

589,A Machine Learning Metasystem for Robust Probabilistic Nonlinear Regression-Based Forecasting of Seasonal Water Availability in the US West,"Hydroelectric power generation, water supplies for municipal, agricultural, manufacturing, and service industry uses including technology-sector requirements, dam safety, flood control, recreational uses, and ecological and legal constraints, all place simultaneous, competing demands on the heavily stressed water management infrastructure of the mostly arid American West. Optimally managing these resources depends on predicting water availability. We built a probabilistic nonlinear regression water supply forecast (WSF) technique for the US Department of Agriculture, which runs the largest stand-alone WSF system in the US West. Design criteria included improved accuracy over the existing system; uncertainty estimates that seamlessly handle complex (heteroscedastic, non-Gaussian) prediction errors; integration of physical hydrometeorological process knowledge and domain-specific expert experience; ability to accommodate nonlinearity, model selection uncertainty and equifinality, and predictor multicollinearity and high dimensionality; and relatively easy, low-cost implementation. Some methods satisfied some of these requirements but none met all, leading us to develop a novel, interdisciplinary, and pragmatic prediction metasystem through a carefully considered synthesis of well-established, off-the-shelf components and approaches, spanning supervised and unsupervised machine learning, nonparametric statistical modeling, ensemble learning, and evolutionary optimization, focusing on maintaining but radically updating the principal components regression framework widely used for WSF. Testing this integrated multi-method prediction engine demonstrated its value for river forecasting; USDA adoption is a landmark for transitioning machine learning from research into practice in this field. Its ability to handle all the foregoing design criteria and requirements, which are not unique to WSF, suggests potential for extension to complex probabilistic prediction problems in other fields.",https://doi.org/10.1109/ACCESS.2019.2936989,10.1109/ACCESS.2019.2936989,"Fleming, Sean W.; Goodbody, Angus G.",IEEE ACCESS,Machine learning; regression analysis; forecast uncertainty; hydroelectric power generation; water resources; environmental management; industry applications,ARTIFICIAL NEURAL NETWORKS; MODEL SELECTION; R-PACKAGE; STREAMFLOW; PREDICTION; THEMES,,IEEE-INST ELECTRICAL ELECTRONICS ENGINEERS INC,PISCATAWAY,"445 HOES LANE, PISCATAWAY, NJ 08855-4141 USA",2169-3536,,,IEEE ACCESS,IEEE Access,,2019,7,,119943,119964,,
590,"SnowCloudHydroA New Framework for Forecasting Streamflow in Snowy, Data-Scarce Regions","We tested the efficacy and skill of SnowCloud, a prototype web-based, cloud-computing framework for snow mapping and hydrologic modeling. SnowCloud is the overarching framework that functions within the Google Earth Engine cloud-computing environment. SnowCloudMetrics is a sub-component of SnowCloud that provides users with spatially and temporally composited snow cover information in an easy-to-use format. SnowCloudHydro is a simple spreadsheet-based model that uses Snow Cover Frequency (SCF) output from SnowCloudMetrics as a key model input. In this application, SnowCloudMetrics rapidly converts NASA's Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) daily snow cover product (MOD10A1) into a monthly snow cover frequency for a user-specified watershed area. SnowCloudHydro uses SCF and prior monthly streamflow to forecast streamflow for the subsequent month. We tested the skill of SnowCloudHydro in three snow-dominated headwaters that represent a range of precipitation/snowmelt runoff categories: the Rio Elqui in Northern Chile; the John Day River, in the Northwestern United States; and the Rio Aragon in Northern Spain. The skill of the SnowCloudHydro model directly corresponded to snowpack contributions to streamflow. Watersheds with proportionately more snowmelt than rain provided better results (R-2 values: 0.88, 0.52, and 0.22, respectively). To test the user experience of SnowCloud, we provided the tools and tutorials in English and Spanish to water resource managers in Chile, Spain, and the United States. Participants assessed their user experience, which was generally very positive. While these initial results focus on SnowCloud, they outline methods for developing cloud-based tools that can function effectively across cultures and languages. Our approach also addresses the primary challenges of science-based computing; human resource limitations, infrastructure costs, and expensive proprietary software.

591,THE FORECASTING OF WATER RUNOFF OF THE STYR RIVER FOR THE COMING YEARS,"Formulation of the problem. The water flow of the Styr River is using for the needs of industry, agriculture and the population. Thus, forecasting the water flow of this river for the future is an important scientific and practical task. The hydrological forecasts that have a lead time of one year, two years, or a decade are not as reliable as they need to be. Now in the world this problem is not solved. Along with quantitative forecasting methods, the qualitative methods have also been developed. The method of commensurability refers to such methods. It was developed by Chinese geophysicist Weng Wen-Bo in 1984. The commensurability method supports prediction of various natural phenomena, including floods and other dangerous events. The objective of this paper is to use the Weng Wen-Bo method for long-term water flow forecasting of the Styr River at Lutsk city. Methods. The commensurability method uses the dates on which natural phenomena (earthquakes, floods, droughts, etc.) were observed. For this reason, it has been called the information method. It is characterized by simplicity of calculation, graphical visualization, the use of researcher intuition and minimum needs for input information. There are several ways of forecasting using the method of commensurability. This paper is used a method of forecasting by two-dimensional commensurability graphs. Such approach consists in the determining the commensurability values in the dates array of certain phenomena occurrence and creating a two-dimensional graph of commensurability, according to which forecasting occurs. The use of such a method allows determining the years that may be wet and dry in the near future. Results. The data of observations at the hydrological station of the Styr River - Lutsk city for the period 1923-2017 are used in the paper. The results of the study on the commensurability method show that the water flow of the river Styr in 2020-2021 should be more than the norm and in 2023-2024 - less than the norm. Scientific novelty and practical significance. In Ukraine the commensurability method was used for the first time for long-term forecasting of water flow for coming years. The estimating of the effectiveness of forecasting by the commensurability method requires an array of long-term forecasts. Therefore, the next step of the study should be to forecast of water flow on different rivers, but provided that they have the long series of observation. The results of the long-term forecasting will enable the relevant services the negative consequences of a hydrological phenomenon, such as low water flow or floods on rivers will prevent.",https://doi.org/10.26565/2410-7360-2021-54-12,10.26565/2410-7360-2021-54-12,"Gorbachova, Liudmyla; Khrystiuk, Borys",VISNYK OF V N KARAZIN KHARKIV NATIONAL UNIVERSITY-SERIES GEOLOGY GEOGRAPHY ECOLOGY,water flow; commensurability method; long-term forecasting; wet year; dry year,FLOODS,,V N KARAZIN KHARKIV NATL UNIV,KHARKIV,"4, SVOBODY SQ, KHARKIV, 61022, UKRAINE",2410-7360,2411-3913,,VISN V N KKNU-GEOL G,Visn.

592,Flood Forecasting Based on an Improved Extreme Learning Machine Model Combined with the Backtracking Search Optimization Algorithm,"Flood forecasting plays an important role in flood control and water resources management. Recently, the data-driven models with a simpler model structure and lower data requirement attract much more attentions. An extreme learning machine (ELM) method, as a typical data-driven method, with the advantages of a faster learning process and stronger generalization ability, has been taken as an effective tool for flood forecasting. However, an ELM model may suffer from local minima in some cases because of its random generation of input weights and hidden layer biases, which results in uncertainties in the flood forecasting model. Therefore, we proposed an improved ELM model for short-term flood forecasting, in which an emerging dual population-based algorithm, named backtracking search algorithm (BSA), was applied to optimize the parameters of ELM. Thus, the proposed method is called ELM-BSA. The upper Yangtze River was selected as a case study. Several performance indexes were used to evaluate the efficiency of the proposed ELM-BSA model. Then the proposed model was compared with the currently used general regression neural network (GRNN) and ELM models. Results show that the ELM-BSA can always provide better results than the GRNN and ELM models in both the training and testing periods. All these results suggest that the proposed ELM-BSA model is a promising alternative technique for flood forecasting.",https://doi.org/10.3390/w10101362,10.3390/w10101362,"Chen, Lu; Sun, Na; Zhou, Chao; Zhou, Jianzhong; Zhou, Yanlai; Zhang, Junhong; Zhou, Qing",WATER,flood forecasting; extreme learning machine (ELM); backtracking search optimization algorithm (BSA); the upper Yangtze River,ARTIFICIAL NEURAL-NETWORK; RAINFALL; OPERATION,,MDPI,BASEL,"ST ALBAN-ANLAGE 66, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND",2073-4441,,,WATER-SUI,Water,OCT,2018,10,10,,,1362,
593,Contribution of potential evaporation forecasts to 10-day streamflow forecast skill for the Rhine River,"Medium-term hydrologic forecast uncertainty is strongly dependent on the forecast quality of meteorological variables. Of these variables, the influence of precipitation has been studied most widely, while temperature, radiative forcing and their derived product potential evapotranspiration (PET) have received little attention from the perspective of hydrological forecasting. This study aims to fill this gap by assessing the usability of potential evaporation forecasts for 10-day-ahead streamflow forecasting in the Rhine basin, Europe. In addition, the forecasts of the meteorological variables are compared with observations. Streamflow reforecasts were performed with the daily wflow_hbv model used in previous studies of the Rhine using the ECMWF 20-year meteorological reforecast dataset. Meteorological forecasts were compared with observed rainfall, temperature, global radiation and potential evaporation for 148 subbasins. Secondly, the effect of using PET climatology versus using observation-based estimates of PET was assessed for hydrological state and for streamflow forecast skill. We find that (1) there is considerable skill in the ECMWF reforecasts to predict PET for all seasons, and (2) using dynamical PET forcing based on observed temperature and satellite global radiation estimates results in lower evaporation and wetter initial states, but (3) the effect on forecasted 10-day streamflow is limited. Implications of this finding are that it is reasonable to use meteorological forecasts to forecast potential evaporation and use this is in mediumrange streamflow forecasts. However, it can be concluded that an approach using PET climatology is also sufficient, most probably not only for the application shown here, but also for most models similar to the HBV concept and for moderate climate zones. As a by-product, this research resulted in gridded datasets for temperature, radiation and potential evaporation based on the Makkink equation for the Rhine basin. The datasets have a spatial resolution of 1.2 x 1.2 km and an hourly time step for the period from July 1996 through 2015. This dataset complements an earlier precipitation dataset for the same area, period and resolution.",https://doi.org/10.5194/hess-23-1453-2019,10.5194/hess-23-1453-2019,"van Osnabrugge, Bart; Uijlenhoet, Remko; Weerts, Albrecht",HYDROLOGY AND EARTH SYSTEM SCIENCES,,RAINFALL-RUNOFF MODEL; EVAPOTRANSPIRATION INPUT; PRECIPITATION CLIMATOLOGY; SOLAR-RADIATION; DATA SETS; IRRADIANCE; UNCERTAINTY; CALIBRATION; VALIDATION; IMPACT,,COPERNICUS GESELLSCHAFT MBH,GOTTINGEN,"BAHNHOFSALLEE 1E, GOTTINGEN, 37081, GERMANY",1027-5606,1607-7938,,HYDROL EARTH SYST SC,Hydrol.

594,Support Vector Regression Integrated with Fruit Fly Optimization Algorithm for River Flow Forecasting in Lake Urmia Basin,"Advancement in river flow prediction systems can greatly empower the operational river management to make better decisions, practices, and policies. Machine learning methods recently have shown promising results in building accurate models for river flow prediction. This paper aims to identify models with higher accuracy, robustness, and generalization ability by inspecting the accuracy of a number of machine learning models. The proposed models for river flow include support vector regression (SVR), a hybrid of SVR with a fruit fly optimization algorithm (FOA) (so-called FOASVR), and an M5 model tree (M5). Additionally, the influence of periodicity (pi) on the forecasting enactment was examined. To assess the performance of the proposed models, different statistical meters were implemented, including root mean squared error (RMSE), mean absolute error (MAE), correlation coefficient (R), and Bayesian information criterion (BIC). Results showed that the FOASVR with RMSE (4.36 and 6.33 m(3)/s), MAE (2.40 and 3.71 m(3)/s) and R (0.82 and 0.81) values had the best performance in forecasting river flows at Babarud and Vaniar stations, respectively. Also, regarding BIC parameters, Q(t-1) and pi were selected as parsimonious inputs for predicting river flow one month ahead. Overall findings indicated that, although both the FOASVR and M5 predicted the river flows in suitable accordance with observed river flows, the performance of the FOASVR was moderately better than the M5 and periodicity noticeably increased the performance of the models; consequently, FOASVR can be suggested as the most accurate method for forecasting river flows.",https://doi.org/10.3390/w11091934,10.3390/w11091934,"Samadianfard, Saeed; Jarhan, Salar; Salwana, Ely; Mosavi, Amir; Shamshirband, Shahaboddin; Akib, Shatirah",WATER,river flow forecasting; stream flow; hybrid machine learning; M5 model tree; fruit fly optimization algorithm (FOA); support vector regression; big data; deep learning; hydro-informatics,M5 MODEL TREE; NEURAL-NETWORKS; PREDICTION; STREAM,,MDPI,BASEL,"ST ALBAN-ANLAGE 66, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND",,2073-4441,,WATER-SUI,Water,SEP,2019,11,9,,,1934,
595,Model calibration for forecasting CO2-foam enhanced oil recovery field pilot performance in a carbonate reservoir,"Application of foam has been found to mitigate challenges associated with field-scale CO2 floods for enhanced oil recovery (EOR) by providing in-depth mobility control. The field pilots that have been run so far have shown varying results, inferred mainly from inter-well tracer studies and production data analysis. A research collaboration has been set up to advance the technology of using foam as a mobility control agent for CO2 EOR, with focus on integrated reservoir modelling to assist technology transfer to a high-cost environment. A heterogeneous carbonate reservoir onshore in west Texas, USA has been selected for the field trial. The reservoir has been waterflooded for more than 50 years, and a significant part of it has been on continuous CO2 injection for the last 5 years. An inverted five-spot pattern, which had rapid CO2 breakthrough in adjacent producers and is currently recycling significant amounts of CO2, has been selected for the study. The pilot is planned for 2 years with surfactant alternating gas (SAG) injection in the first year, followed by CO2 injection in the next year. A reservoir model was created by integrating available static and dynamic information. Since the measurement of static information and production performance is usually imprecise, even the most carefully constructed models do not exactly represent reality. In this paper, we present a workflow that was used to calibrate the reservoir model to historical data for practical forecasting, which takes into account a wide range of uncertainties caused by the inaccessibility of information. Laboratory studies were performed with reservoir cores, fluids and selected surfactant to obtain the base values of foam model parameters. As an output, distributions for key performance indicators such as cumulative oil production and CO2 retention were generated for the proposed pilot to guide further decision-making.",https://doi.org/10.1144/petgeo2019-093,10.1144/petgeo2019-093,"Sharma, M.; Alcorn, Z.

596,A Promising Wavelet Decomposition-NNARX Model to Predict Flood: Application to Kelantan River Flood,"Flood is a major disaster that happens around the world. It has caused many casualties and massive destruction of property. Estimating the chance of a flood occurring depends on several factors, such as rainfall, the structure and the flow rate of the river. This research used the neural network autoregressive exogenous input (NNARX) model to predict floods. One of the research challenges was to develop accurate models and improve the forecasting model. This research aimed to improve the performance of the neural network model for flood prediction. A new technique was proposed for modelling nonlinear data of flood forecasting using the wavelet decomposition-NNARX approach. This paper discusses the process of identifying the parameters involved to make a forecast as the rainfall value requires the flow rate of the river and its water level. The original data were processed by wavelet decomposition and filtered to generate a new set of data for the NNARX prediction model where the process can be compared. This research compared the performance of the wavelet and the non-wavelet NNARX model. Experimental results showed that the proposed approach had better performance testing results in relation to its counterpart in terms of hourly forecast, with the mean square error (MSE) of 2.0491e-4 m2 compared to 6.16420 e(-4) m(2), respectively. The proposed approach was also studied for long-term forecast up to 5 years, where the obtained MSE was higher, i.e., 0.0016 m(2).",https://doi.org/,,"Anuar, Mohd Azrol Syafiee; Rahman, Ribhan Zafira Abdul; Soh, Azura Che; Noor, Samsul Bahari Mohd; Zulkafli, Zed Diyana",INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ELECTRICAL AND COMPUTER ENGINEERING SYSTEMS,backpropagation neural network (BPNN); nonlinear autoregressive neural network with exogenous inputs (NNARX); flood prediction model; wavelet decomposition,ARTIFICIAL NEURAL-NETWORK; FUZZY-LOGIC; HYBRID; ANN,,"J J STROSSMAYER UNIV OSIJEK, FAC ELECTRICAL ENGINEERING",OSIJEK,"KNEZA TRPIMIRA 2B, OSIJEK, 31000, CROATIA",1847-6996,1847-7003,,INT J ELECTR COMPUT,Int.

597,Small Watershed Stream-Flow Forecasting Based on LSTM,"In recent years, researchers in the field of pattern recognition utilize Artificial Intelligence (AI) based methods to solve the problem of Stream-flow forecasting. Forecasting hydrological time series is of great importance yet very challenging as it is affected by many complex correlations factors in small watershed. In this paper, we forecast the flow values over the next 6 h, using a time series model based on Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) that considers past stream-flow data, past weather data and weather forecasts data of the hydrological stations. We evaluate our model by root mean square error (RMSE), median absolute error (MedAE) and coefficient of determination (R2) in our study case. Compared with the SVM prediction model, the LSTM prediction model has better prediction accuracy, especially the flood peak flow forecast has better performance. The model has achieved satisfactory results in river flow predicting and provided a new method for flood forecasting in small watershed.",https://doi.org/10.1007/978-3-030-19063-7_79,10.1007/978-3-030-19063-7_79,"Yan, Le; Feng, Jun; Hang, Tingting",PROCEEDINGS OF THE 13TH INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE ON UBIQUITOUS INFORMATION MANAGEMENT AND COMMUNICATION (IMCOM) 2019,Machine-learning model; Stream-flow forecasting; LSTM; Small watershed,ARTIFICIAL NEURAL-NETWORK; RIVER FLOW; WAVELET; MODELS,,SPRINGER INTERNATIONAL PUBLISHING AG,CHAM,"GEWERBESTRASSE 11, CHAM, CH-6330, SWITZERLAND",2194-5357,2194-5365,978-3-030-19063-7; 978-3-030-19062-0,ADV INTELL SYST,,,2019,935,,1006,1014,,

The one-dimensional hydrodynamics and water quality numerical model of the cascade pumping station with sudden water pollution accident were established to study the transformation law of pollutant transportation and forecast its impact on water quality. Considering the propagation speed of pollutants and the variation of channel water level, the emergency control mode of pump station and backwater gate under water pollution accident is put forward. On the basis of this, the rules and schemes of pumping station and backwater gates are worked out. The variation range of the pollution group, the variation of the water level of the channel, the discharge quantity and so on under different control schemes are simulated and analyzed. Finally, the optimal pump station and gate scheduling control scheme is selected to effectively control the water pollution accident and ensure the safety of pump stations and channels.

599,Seasonal Rainfall Forecasts for the Yangtze River Basin of China in Summer 2019 from an Improved Climate Service,"Rainfall forecasts for the summer monsoon season in the Yangtze River basin (YRB) allow decision-makers to plan for possible flooding, which can affect the lives and livelihoods of millions of people. A trial climate service was developed in 2016, producing a prototype seasonal forecast product for use by stakeholders in the region, based on rainfall forecasts directly from a dynamical model. Here, we describe an improved service based on a simple statistical downscaling approach. Through using dynamical forecast of an East Asian summer monsoon (EASM) index, seasonal mean rainfall for the upper and middle/lower reaches of YRB can be forecast separately by use of the statistical downscaling, with significant skills for lead times of up to at least three months. The skill in different sub-basin regions of YRB varies with the target season. The rainfall forecast skill in the middle/lower reaches of YRB is significant in May-June-July (MJJ), and the forecast skill for rainfall in the upper reaches of YRB is significant in June-July-August (JJA). The mean rainfall for the basin as a whole can be skillfully forecast in both MJJ and JJA. The forecasts issued in 2019 gave good guidance for the enhanced rainfall in the MJJ period and the near-average conditions in JJA. Initial feedback from users in the basin suggests that the improved forecasts better meet their needs and will enable more robust decision-making.",https://doi.org/10.1007/s13351-020-0049-z,10.1007/s13351-020-0049-z,"Bett, Philip E.; Martin, Nicola; Scaife, Adam A.; Dunstone, Nick; Martin, Gill M.; Golding, Nicola; Camp, Joanne; Zhang, Peiqun; Hewitt, Chris D.; Hermanson, Leon; Li, Chaofan; Ren, Hong-Li; Liu, Ying; Liu, Min",JOURNAL OF METEOROLOGICAL RESEARCH,seasonal rainfall forecasts; climate service; Yangtze River basin (YRB); East Asian summer monsoon (EASM),MODEL; PREDICTION; MONSOON; CONFIGURATION; ANOMALIES; MIDDLE; JULES; FLOOD,,SPRINGER HEIDELBERG,HEIDELBERG,"TIERGARTENSTRASSE 17, D-69121 HEIDELBERG, GERMANY",2095-6037,2198-0934,,J METEOROL RES-PRC,J.

In this study, Geographically Weighted Regression (GWR) analysis was used to identify the dominant environmental factors that might influence the occurrence of Anthracnose-twister disease of onion using Geographic Information System approach. The onion disease records were acquired from the Institute of Climate Change and Environmental Management. The weather parameters such as relative humidity, cumulative rainfall and temperature were acquired from the National Aeronautics and Space Administration website while the river parameters were generated from Sentinel-2 images. This study has identified the 'distance to river' and 'rainfall' factor as the two (2) important factors that may influence the occurrence of the disease.

601,Assessing the predictability of MLR models for long-term streamflow using lagged climate indices as predictors: a case study of NSW (Australia),"The current study aims to assess the potential of statistical multiple linear regression (MLR) techniques to develop long-term streamflow forecast models for New South Wales (NSW). While most of the past studies were concentrated on revealing the relationship between streamflow and single concurrent or lagged climate indices, this study intends to explore the combined impact of large-scale climate drivers. Considering their influences on the streamflow of NSW, several major climate drivers - IPO (Inter Decadal Pacific Oscillation)/PDO (Pacific Decadal Oscillation), IOD (Indian Ocean Dipole) and ENSO (El Nino-Southern Oscillation) are selected. Single correlation analysis is exploited as the basis for selecting different combinations of input variables for developing MLR models to examine the extent of the combined impacts of the selected climate drivers on forecasting spring streamflow several months ahead. The developed models with all the possible combinations show significantly good results for all selected 12 stations in terms of Pearson correlation (r), root mean square error (RMSE), mean absolute error (MAE) and Willmott index of agreement (d). For each region, the best model with lower errors provides statistically significant maximum correlation which ranges from 0.51 to 0.65.",https://doi.org/10.2166/nh.2018.171,10.2166/nh.2018.171,"Esha, Rijwana, I; Imteaz, Monzur A.",HYDROLOGY RESEARCH,MLR; NINO3.4; PDO; seasonal forecast; streamflow,NEW-SOUTH-WALES; MULTI-DECADAL VARIABILITY; EL-NINO; EASTERN AUSTRALIA; INDIAN-OCEAN; RAINFALL; OSCILLATION; DROUGHT; ENSO; IDENTIFICATION,,IWA PUBLISHING,LONDON,"ALLIANCE HOUSE, 12 CAXTON ST, LONDON SW1H0QS, ENGLAND",0029-1277,2224-7955,,HYDROL RES,Hydrol.

602,Performance of Post-Processed Methods in Hydrological Predictions Evaluated by Deterministic and Probabilistic Criteria,"Meteorological Ensemble Streamflow Prediction (ESP), which uses Ensemble Weather forecasts (EWFs) to drive hydrological models, is a useful methodology for extending forecast periods and to provide valuable uncertainty information to improve the operation of future water resources. However, raw EWFs are usually biased and under-dispersive and so cannot be directly used in ESP, leading to the development of several post-processing methods. The performance of these methods needs to be evaluated/compared in building ESP based on deterministic and probabilistic criteria. In addition, likely influencing factors also need to be identified. This study evaluated the performance of four state-of-the-art methods: the Generator-based Post-Processing (GPP) method, Extended Logistic Regression (ExLR), Bayesian Model Averaging (BMA) and Affine Kernel Dressing (AKD), using a simple bias correction (BC) method as a benchmark. The evaluation was carried out over four watersheds with different basin areas in the humid region of central-south China based on the weather reforecasts from the Global Ensemble Forecasting System (GEFS). The results show that the performance of the post-processing methods varies with the forecast variable (precipitation, or air temperature or streamflow), but all of them outperform the BC and GEFS. For the four post-processing methods, the advantage of the generator-based methods (GPP and ExLR) lies in their probabilistic performance, which outperforms the distribution-based methods (BMA and AKD) by about 10% in precipitation forecasts and about 20% in streamflow forecasts, while the distribution-based methods (BMA and AKD) are better at their deterministic performance for precipitation forecasts, with a benefit of about 15%. Meanwhile, the post-processing methods generally perform better for precipitation and streamflow forecasts, but worse for air temperature forecasts for a bigger basin compared to the distribution-based methods. The results of this study emphasize the importance of considering the uncertainty of post-processing methods in ESP.",https://doi.org/10.1007/s11269-019-02302-y,10.1007/s11269-019-02302-y,"Li, Xiang-Quan; Chen, Jie; Xu, Chong-Yu; Li, Lu; Chen, Hua",WATER RESOURCES MANAGEMENT,Ensemble streamflow prediction (ESP); Ensemble weather forecast (EWF); Post-processing method; Deterministic criteria; Probabilistic criteria,GFS ENSEMBLE REFORECASTS; LOGISTIC-REGRESSION; WEATHER FORECASTS; MOS METHODS; PRECIPITATION; MODEL; ECMWF,,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0920-4741,1573-1650,,WATER RESOUR MANAG,Water Resour.

603,Sea-surface temperatures predict targeted visual surveys of octopus abundance,"In upwelling systems around the world, octopus abundance is forecast by marine productivity linked to upwelling strength, often indicated by sea-surface temperatures. Climate change may disrupt populations of marine animals that are linked to such temperature-dependent events. We analysed the relationship of the abundance of giant Pacific octopuses (Enteroctopus dofleini) to Gulf of Alaska and Washington State water temperatures. Abundance was measured in targeted visual surveys in Prince William Sound, Alaska, over the period 1995-2016 and from REEF.org diver surveys in Washington State from 2003 to 2019. Octopus counts from both survey programs had significant negative correlations with water temperatures over the previous 2.5-4 years. Water temperature accounted for from 0.41 to 0.71 of the variance (R-2) in octopus abundance in eastern Gulf of Alaska waters located in ocean currents up-stream of the survey areas, and up to 0.81 of the variance in Washington State waters. These negative correlations provide a possible predictive index for octopus abundance as measured by targeted visual surveys. These methods may be useful tools in management of octopuses and indicate impacts of climate change on North Pacific coastal marine ecosystems.",https://doi.org/10.1071/MF20318,10.1071/MF20318,"Scheel, D.; Johnson, C.",MARINE AND FRESHWATER RESEARCH,population; environmental variability; recruitment; fisheries assessment; Enteroctopus dofleini; Prince William Sound; Puget Sound; climate change,POPULATION; INSULARIS; VULGARIS; DYNAMICS; STOCK,,CSIRO PUBLISHING,CLAYTON,"UNIPARK, BLDG 1, LEVEL 1, 195 WELLINGTON RD, LOCKED BAG 10, CLAYTON, VIC 3168, AUSTRALIA",1323-1650,1448-6059,,MAR FRESHWATER RES,Mar.

605,The Problem of Forecasting of Vertical Temperature Distribution in Inland Hydrophysical Objects with Experimental Data,"The problem of computation of vertical temperature distribution in inland water objects is raised in the research, and the modified version of the program complex LAKE is proposed for its solving. Also the results of validation of the modified version in accordance with the parameters of lake part of Gorky water reservoir are provided. The modification caused changing the procedure of input data assignment, ensured the possibility of using the results from field measurements as starting profiles, led to the greater consideration of wind influence on mixing and allowed to reproduce general forms of distribution more accurately. The data from the experimental sites of Gorky water reservoir in combination with the files of global reanalysis and the data of hydrometeorological station were used for validation. Measurements of the vertical temperature profiles were carried out with freely sinking CTD-probe, which recorded the temperature values several times per second. Time and temperature dependences in control points, comparison of the forms of the profiles and standard deviation were analyzed to assess the results of numerical modeling. Numerical simulation with the modified model gave results which were in good agreement with the real seasonal variations of thermal regime in lake part of Gorky water reservoir. The best quantitative and qualitative agreement was obtained for the thermal regimes with strong mixing: the results of the forecasting reproduced the forms of distribution and the values of temperature extremely accurately. The results for the ones with strong stratification demonstrated less accuracy in the values of temperature in control points, particularly near the surface, but all specificities of the forms of vertical temperature distribution were correctly reproduced.",https://doi.org/10.1007/978-3-319-77788-7_34,10.1007/978-3-319-77788-7_34,"Gladskikh, D.; Sergeev, D.; Baydakov, G.; Soustova, I.; Troitskaya, Yu.",PHYSICAL AND MATHEMATICAL MODELING OF EARTH AND ENVIRONMENT PROCESSES,Vertical temperature distribution; Temperature profile; Numerical modeling; Inland water objects,,,SPRINGER INTERNATIONAL PUBLISHING AG,CHAM,"GEWERBESTRASSE 11, CHAM, CH-6330, SWITZERLAND",2197-9545,,978-3-319-77788-7; 978-3-319-77787-0,SPR GEOL,,,2018,,,327,335,,

This study is based on two years (2015-2016) of rain estimates from a dual-polarization S-band Doppler weather radar (SPOL) and flood locations observed by the Climate Emergency Management Center (CGE) of Sao Paulo City Hall. The logistic regression model is based on daily accumulated precipitation, a maximum precipitation rate, and daily rainfall duration. The model presented a probability of detection (POD) of 46% (71%) on average for flood events (conditional), while, for events without flash flood, it reached 98% probability.

607,TOPKAPI Model and Its Application of Flood Early Warning and Forecasting in China,"TOPKAPI (tographic kinematic approximation and integration) model is a distributed hydrological model with physical mechanism developed by Prof. Ezio Todiniin and his team in Italy at the beginning of the 21st century. It can fully consider the spatial variability of rainfall, topography, vegetation, soil, and other factors. The TOPKAPI model is simple in structure and in parameter composition, so it has great advantages in real-time flood forecasting in river basins. On the basis of introducing the basic principle and structure characteristics of the TOPKAPI model, this paper explains the terrain data, hydro-meteorological data, soil, land use, and other data needed for the application of TOPKAPI model and the acquisition ways or approaches of the data. Then it analyzes the application of TOPKAPI model in the world, especially the application of flood forecasting in China. Finally, the TOPKAPI model is compared with TOPMODEL model, SWAT model, and lumped Xin'anjiang model. It points out that TOPKAPI model has great application potential in real-time flood forecasting, but it is inadequate in the areas where human activities are intense. It is necessary to combine other methods or models to improve the simulation process and the simulation effect, and it is also need to develop concurrent application versions of the network to meet the need of real-time flood forecasting of some departments at the same time. The research results may provide some reference for the improvement of TOPKAPI model and its application and popularization in real-time flood early warning and forecasting in China.",https://doi.org/,,"Liang, Lili; Li, Kuang; Ye, Yuntao; Xu, Haiqing; Hu, Yufeng","WORLD ENVIRONMENTAL AND WATER RESOURCES CONGRESS 2019: WATER, WASTEWATER, AND STORMWATER; URBAN WATER RESOURCES; AND MUNICIPAL WATER INFRASTRUCTURE",Distributed hydrological model; TOPKAPI; Flood forecasting; Ungauged basins,,,AMER SOC CIVIL ENGINEERS,NEW YORK,"UNITED ENGINEERING CENTER, 345 E 47TH ST, NEW YORK, NY 10017-2398 USA",,,978-0-7844-8236-0,,,,2019,,,113,123,,
608,Seasonal drought predictability and forecast skill in the semi-arid endorheic Heihe River basin in northwestern China,"Endorheic and arid regions around the world are suffering from serious drought problems. In this study, a drought forecasting system based on eight state-of-the-art climate models from the North American Multi-Model Ensemble (NMME) and a Distributed Time-Variant Gain Hydrological Model (DTVGM) was established and assessed over the upstream and midstream of Heihe River basin (UHRB and MHRB), a typical arid endorheic basin. The 3-month Standardized Precipitation Index (SPI3) and 1-month Standardized Streamflow Index (SSI1) were used to capture meteorological and hydrological drought, and values below - 1 indicate drought events. The skill of the forecasting systems was evaluated in terms of anomaly correlation (AC) and Brier score (BS) or Brier skill score (BSS). The predictability for meteorological drought was quantified using AC and BS with a perfect model assumption, referring to the upper limit of forecast skill. The hydrological predictability was to distinguish the role of initial hydrological conditions (ICs) and meteorological forcings, which was quantified by root-mean-square error (RMSE) within the ESP (Ensemble Streamflow Prediction) and reverse ESP framework. The UHRB and MHRB showed season-dependent meteorological drought predictability and forecast skill, with higher values during winter and autumn than that during spring. For hydrological forecasts, the forecast skill in the UHRB was higher than that in MHRB. Predicting meteorological droughts more than 2 months in advance became difficult because of complex climate mechanisms. However, the hydrological drought forecasts could show some skills up to 3-6 lead months due to memory of ICs during cold and dry sea-sons. During wet seasons, there are no skillful hydrological predictions from lead month 2 onwards because of the dominant role of meteorological forcings. During spring, the improvement of hydrological drought predictions was the most significant as more streamflow was generated by seasonal snowmelt. Besides meteorological forcings and ICs, human activities have reduced the hydrological variability and increased hydrological drought predictability during the wet seasons in the MHRB.",https://doi.org/10.5194/hess-22-5697-2018,10.5194/hess-22-5697-2018,"Ma, Feng; Luo, Lifeng; Ye, Aizhong; Duan, Qingyun",HYDROLOGY AND EARTH SYSTEM SCIENCES,,CLIMATE-CHANGE; HYDROLOGICAL DROUGHT; UNITED-STATES; PREDICTION; FRAMEWORK; TEMPERATURE; SIMULATION; SYSTEM,,COPERNICUS GESELLSCHAFT MBH,GOTTINGEN,"BAHNHOFSALLEE 1E, GOTTINGEN, 37081, GERMANY",1027-5606,1607-7938,,HYDROL EARTH SYST SC,Hydrol.

609,Understanding the Impact of Observation Data Uncertainty on Probabilistic Streamflow Forecasts Using a Dynamic Hierarchical Model,"Earlier researches have proposed algorithms to quantify the measurement uncertainty in rating curves and found that the magnitude of the uncertainty can be significant enough to impact hydrologic modeling. Therefore, they suggested frameworks to include measurement uncertainty in the rating curve to make it robust. Despite their efforts, a robust rating curve is often ignored in traditional practices, considering the investment of time and money as well as the resulting benefit from it. In the current research, we are interested in understanding the role of the measurement error variance in real-time streamflow forecasting. Our objectives are (i) to employ a state-of-the-art statistical forecasting model that can handle measurement uncertainty in daily streamflow and (ii) to understand the trade-off in forecasting performance when substantial knowledge regarding the measurement uncertainty is provided to the modeler. We apply the Bayesian dynamic hierarchical model (BDHM) on four gauging sites in the United States. Results show that the BDHM performs better than the daily climatology and local linear regression model. Also, the forecast variance changes proportionally with the change in the error variance as an input in the observation equation. Following this, we design a simulation-based study, which assigns the measurement error in the reported streamflow to obtain multiple realizations of the true streamflow. The inclusion of substantial knowledge about the true error improves the BDHM's performance by lowering the CRPS (continuous rank probability score) values. However, the inclusion increases the forecast variance to bring the true streamflow within the sampling variability of the forecasted streamflow. Overall, an improved trade-off between the success rate of forecasts and the forecast variance can be achieved by including the measurement error in the BDHM for rivers that witness less dispersed streamflow data. Plain Language Summary Rating curve uncertainty is one of the major sources of measurement uncertainty in reported streamflow. It occurs when a precalibrated stage-discharge relationship curve is used to indirectly measure the streamflow volume based on river stage measurement. Considering the cost and time involved to include the uncertainty in reported streamflow, rating curve uncertainty is often ignored in traditional streamflow modeling practices. The current study adopts a state-of-the-art statistical model that can include rating curve uncertainty while issuing daily streamflow forecasts 1 to 3 days in advance. The study found that a proper knowledge of rating curve uncertainty at a gauge site significantly improves the forecasting of true streamflow. Key Points Bayesian dynamic hierarchical model (BDHM) can include the measurement uncertainty that has a substantial impact on real-time forecasting BDHM efficiently predicts the reported streamflow 1 to 3 days in advance while compared with the daily climatology and a semiparametric forecasting model Knowledge of the measurement uncertainty improves the overall performance of BDHM in predicting the true streamflows",https://doi.org/10.1029/2019WR025463,10.1029/2019WR025463,"Das Bhowmik, Rajarshi; Ng, Tze Ling; Wang, Jui-Pin",WATER RESOURCES RESEARCH,uncertainty; measurement error; Bayesian; BDHM; forecasting; Streamflow,RATING-CURVE UNCERTAINTY; RIVER DISCHARGE; FLOOD; CALIBRATION; ERROR; SCORE,,AMER GEOPHYSICAL UNION,WASHINGTON,"2000 FLORIDA AVE NW, WASHINGTON, DC 20009 USA",0043-1397,1944-7973,,WATER RESOUR RES,Water Resour.

610,"Impact of complexity on daily and multi-step forecasting of streamflow with chaotic, stochastic, and black-box models","Despite significant research advances achieved during the last decades, seemingly inconsistent forecasting results related to stochastic, chaotic, and black-box approaches have been reported. Herein, we attempt to address the entropy/complexity resulting from hydrological and climatological conditions. Accordingly, mutual information function, correlation dimension, averaged false nearest neighbor with E1 and E2 quantities, and complexity analysis that uses sample entropy coupled with iterative amplitude adjusted Fourier transform were employed as nonlinear deterministic identification tools. We investigated forecasting of daily streamflow for three climatologically different Swedish rivers, Helge, Ljusnan, and Kalix Rivers using self-exciting threshold autoregressive (SETAR), k-nearest neighbor (k-nn), and artificial neural networks (ANN). The results suggest that the streamflow in these rivers during the 1957-2012 period exhibited dynamics from low to high complexity. Specifically, (1) lower complexity lead to higher predictability at all leadtimes and the models' worst performances were obtained for the most complex streamflow (Ljusnan River), (2) ANN was the best model for 1-day ahead forecasting independent of complexity, (3) SETAR was the best model for 7-day ahead forecasting by means of performance indices, especially for less complexity, (4) the largest error propagation was obtained with the k-nn and ANN and thus these models should be carefully used beyond 2-day forecasting, and (5) higher number input variables except for the dominant variables made insignificant impact on forecasting performances for ANN and k-nn models.",https://doi.org/10.1007/s00477-016-1236-4,10.1007/s00477-016-1236-4,"Tongal, Hakan; Berndtsson, Ronny",STOCHASTIC ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH AND RISK ASSESSMENT,Correlation dimension; Averaged false nearest neighbor (AFN); Sample entropy; Self-exciting threshold autoregressive; k-Nearest neighbor; Artificial neural networks,ARTIFICIAL NEURAL-NETWORKS; PHASE-SPACE RECONSTRUCTION; TIME-SERIES PREDICTION; RIVER FLOW; APPROXIMATE ENTROPY; NONLINEAR-ANALYSIS; SAMPLE ENTROPY; DYNAMICS; RAINFALL; CATCHMENT,,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"233 SPRING ST, NEW YORK, NY 10013 USA",1436-3240,1436-3259,,STOCH ENV RES RISK A,Stoch.

611,Application of experimental design for the optimization of artificial neural network-based water quality model: a case study of dissolved oxygen prediction,"This paper presents an application of experimental design for the optimization of artificial neural network (ANN) for the prediction of dissolved oxygen (DO) content in the Danube River. The aim of this research was to obtain a more reliable ANN model that uses fewer monitoring records, by simultaneous optimization of the following model parameters: number of monitoring sites, number of historical monitoring data (expressed in years), and number of input water quality parameters used. Box-Behnken three-factor at three levels experimental design was applied for simultaneous spatial, temporal, and input variables optimization of the ANN model. The prediction of DO was performed using a feed-forward back-propagation neural network (BPNN), while the selection of most important inputs was done off-model using multi-filter approach that combines a chi-square ranking in the first step with a correlation-based elimination in the second step. The contour plots of absolute and relative error response surfaces were utilized to determine the optimal values of design factors. From the contour plots, two BPNN models that cover entire Danube flow through Serbia are proposed: an upstream model (BPNN-UP) that covers 8 monitoring sites prior to Belgrade and uses 12 inputs measured in the 7-year period and a downstream model (BPNN-DOWN) which covers 9 monitoring sites and uses 11 input parameters measured in the 6-year period. The main difference between the two models is that BPNN-UP utilizes inputs such as BOD, P, and PO43-, which is in accordance with the fact that this model covers northern part of Serbia (Vojvodina Autonomous Province) which is well-known for agricultural production and extensive use of fertilizers. Both models have shown very good agreement between measured and predicted DO (with R-2 >= 0.86) and demonstrated that they can effectively forecast DO content in the Danube River.",https://doi.org/10.1007/s11356-018-1246-5,10.1007/s11356-018-1246-5,"Tomic, Aleksandra Siljic; Antanasijevic, Davor; Ristic, Mirjana; Peric-Grujic, Aleksandra; Pocajt, Viktor",ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE AND POLLUTION RESEARCH,Dissolved oxygen; Modeling; ANN; Design of experiment; Parameter selection,RESPONSE-SURFACE METHODOLOGY; BOX-BEHNKEN DESIGN; DANUBE RIVER; BACKPROPAGATION; PARAMETERS; TOOL,,SPRINGER HEIDELBERG,HEIDELBERG,"TIERGARTENSTRASSE 17, D-69121 HEIDELBERG, GERMANY",0944-1344,1614-7499,,ENVIRON SCI POLLUT R,Environ.

612,"Hydrological drought forecasting using multi-scalar streamflow drought index, stochastic models and machine learning approaches, in northern Iran","Hydrological drought is an environmental event that affects surface water resources such as surface runoff and reservoir levels and its prediction, can help the water managers to be aware of the future status of the region. This study aims to predict and evaluate hydrological drought in the southwestern margin of the Caspian Sea. For this, Streamflow Drought Index (SDI) is used as a multi-scalar hydrological drought indicator and calculated in time windows of 1, 3, 6, 9 and 12-month. In this study, time series stochastic models were used for the first time to predict SDI and compared with two black-box machine learning (ML) methods including Adaptive Neuro-Fuzzy Inference System (ANFIS) and Group Method of Data Handling (GMDH). The used data belongs to two rivers named Khalkaei and Pasikhan in Guilan province, and the period of 1986-2015 on a monthly scale. Autocorrelation and Partial Autocorrelation Functions (ACF and PACF) was used for selecting inputs among the series' monthly time lags. The results showed that there are seasonal trends in SDI's 1, 3, 6 and 9-month time windows; therefore, these time windows have better adaptability with the Seasonal Autoregressive Integrated Moving Average (SARIMA) model. But there is no seasonal trend in the 12-month time window (SDI12) series and the non-seasonal Autoregressive Moving Average (ARMA) model was found as the best choice for this time window. Among the models, the MLs (GMDH and ANFIS) had approximately similar prediction accuracies. Comparing the models indicate that the linear stochastic models in addition to the simplicity of use were significantly more accurate than the complex non-linear ML models. The current results suggest using the stochastic models for hydrological drought forecasting, in catchment areas.",https://doi.org/10.1007/s00477-020-01949-z,10.1007/s00477-020-01949-z,"Aghelpour, Pouya; Bahrami-Pichaghchi, Hadigheh; Varshavian, Vahid",STOCHASTIC ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH AND RISK ASSESSMENT,Hydrological drought; Streamflow drought index; Group method of data handling; ARIMA; ANFIS,NEURAL-NETWORK; FUZZY; PREDICTION; ANFIS,,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"ONE NEW YORK PLAZA, SUITE 4600, NEW YORK, NY, UNITED STATES",1436-3240,1436-3259,,STOCH ENV RES RISK A,Stoch.

613,Integrating VGI and 2D hydraulic models into a data assimilation framework for real time flood forecasting and mapping,"Crowdsourced data can effectively observe environmental and urban ecosystem processes. The use of data produced by untrained people into flood forecasting models may effectively allow Early Warning Systems (EWS) to better perform while support decision-making to reduce the fatalities and economic losses due to inundation hazard. In this work, we develop a Data Assimilation (DA) method integrating Volunteered Geographic Information (VGI) and a 2D hydraulic model and we test its performances. The proposed framework seeks to extend the capabilities and performances of standard DA works, based on the use of traditional in situ sensors, by assimilating VGI while managing and taking into account the uncertainties related to the quality, and the location and timing of the entire set of observational data. The November 2012 flood in the Italian Tiber River basin was selected as the case study. Results show improvements of the model in terms of uncertainty with a significant persistence of the model updating after the integration of the VGI, even in the case of use of few-selected observations gathered from social media. This will encourage further research in the use of VGI for EWS considering the exponential increase of quality and quantity of smartphone and social media user worldwide.",https://doi.org/10.1080/10095020.2019.1626135,10.1080/10095020.2019.1626135,"Annis, Antonio; Nardi, Fernando",GEO-SPATIAL INFORMATION SCIENCE,Crowdsourced data; VGI; data assimilation (DA); flood forecasting; 2D hydraulic modelling,VOLUNTEERED GEOGRAPHIC INFORMATION; HYDROLOGICAL DATA ASSIMILATION; SOCIAL MEDIA; SEQUENTIAL ASSIMILATION; STREAMFLOW OBSERVATIONS; INTERPOLATION; BASIN; PRECIPITATION; HYDROGRAPH; CLIMATE,,TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD,ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OR14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1009-5020,1993-5153,,GEO-SPAT INF SCI,Geo-Spat.

614,Reservoir Operators React to Uncertainty in Snowmelt Runoff Forecasts,"Over 1 billion people rely on snow and ice for their water supply, and in many areas, reservoirs store the water after the snow melts. Deciding when to release water depends partly on forecasts of how much more rain and snowmelt will flow into the reservoirs. Often these forecasts express uncertainty, reporting a range of possible flows. We examined how those responsible for releasing water from reservoirs respond to forecasts using a case study of the historical record of past forecasts and water releases in California's Sierra Nevada. Results from a panel data model with fixed effects showed that these water managers hedge their bets against the possibility of less water than forecasted. Greater uncertainty in a forecast was associated significantly with a reduced amount of released water, and the effect of uncertainty on releases declined as the forecast volume increased (adjusted R-2=0.70, F-test pMUCH LESS-THAN0.001). Our results suggest that increasing water managers' confidence in upcoming flows by reducing forecast uncertainty would allow more water to be released from reservoirs earlier in the year, without the need for direct coordination with these managers.",https://doi.org/10.1061/(ASCE)WR.1943-5452.0001437,10.1061/(ASCE)WR.1943-5452.0001437,"Stillinger, Timbo; Costello, Christopher; Bales, Roger C.; Dozier, Jeff",JOURNAL OF WATER RESOURCES PLANNING AND MANAGEMENT,,WATER EQUIVALENT; MANAGEMENT; RESOURCES; FRAMEWORK,,ASCE-AMER SOC CIVIL ENGINEERS,RESTON,"1801 ALEXANDER BELL DR, RESTON, VA 20191-4400 USA",0733-9496,1943-5452,,J WATER RES PLAN MAN,J.

615,Integrating weather and climate predictions for seamless hydrologic ensemble forecasting: A case study in the Yalong River basin,"Despite the tremendous improvement made in numerical weather and climate models over the recent years, the forecasts generated by those models still cannot be used directly for hydrological forecasting. A post-processor like the Ensemble Pre-Processor (EPP) developed by U.S. National Weather Service must be used to remove various biases and to extract useful predictive information from those forecasts, In this paper, we investigate how different designs of canonical events in the EPP can help post-process precipitation forecasts from the Global Ensemble Forecast System (GEFS) and Climate Forecast System Version 2 (CFSv2). The use of canonical events allow those products to be linked seamlessly and then the post-processed ensemble precipitation forecasts can be generated using the Schaake Shuffle procedure. We used the post-processed ensemble precipitation forecasts to drive a distributed hydrological model to obtain ensemble streamflow forecasts and evaluated those forecasts against the observed streamflow. We found that the careful design of canonical events can help extract more useful information, especially when up-to-date observed precipitation is used to setup the canonical events. We also found that streamflow forecasts using post-processed precipitation forecasts have longer lead times and higher accuracy than streamflow forecasts made by traditional Extend Streamflow Prediction (ESP) and the forecasts based on original GEFS and CFSv2 precipitation forecasts.

616,4 Hours NNARX Flood Prediction Model Using traingd and trainoss Training Function: A Comparative Study,"Research on flood disasters are popular area of researches and more and more advanced tools are uses to obtain reliable predicted results. This due to flood causes harm to people and their property specifically. Thus, many hydrological models are propose and developed by researchers around the world to forecast flood disaster ahead of time for evacuation purposes. However, it is very difficult to develop flood model because all physical parameters that represent the flood behaviour must be included in the modelling. Parameters such as the depth of river basin, river flow rate and sediment factors data are very difficult to get. Hence, this paper proposes flood prediction model using black-box model. It is call black-box model because the model is develop using only input and output data without the needs to know the physical parameters that contribute to flood disaster. Neural Network Autoregressive with Exogenous Inputs (NNARX) is one type of black-box model that is widely applied to solve the nonlinear problems. In order to develop the model, flood data were divide into 3 samples that are modelling sample, validation sample and testing sample. All samples were provide from related government agency and it is real-time data. The model were develop using two different training functions in order to obtain the optimal ones. The prediction time is set at 4 hours ahead of time. Simulation works and model performances was done using MATLAB Neural Network Toolbox. Findings show that the propose NNARX model with 4 hours prediction time that trained using traingd had produced better result.",https://doi.org/,,"Ruslan, Fazlina Ahmat; Samad, Abd Manan; Adnan, Ramli",2018 IEEE 14TH INTERNATIONAL COLLOQUIUM ON SIGNAL PROCESSING & ITS APPLICATIONS (CSPA 2018),Neural Network; NNARX,NEURAL-NETWORKS,,IEEE,NEW YORK,"345 E 47TH ST, NEW YORK, NY 10017 USA",,,978-1-5386-0389-5,,,,2018,,,77,81,,
617,Assessment of an ensemble seasonal streamflow forecasting system for Australia,"Despite an increasing availability of skilful longrange streamflow forecasts, many water agencies still rely on simple resampled historical inflow sequences (stochastic scenarios) to plan operations over the coming year. We assess a recently developed forecasting system called forecast guided stochastic scenarios (FoGSS) as a skilful alternative to standard stochastic scenarios for the Australian continent. FoGSS uses climate forecasts from a coupled oceanland-atmosphere prediction system, post-processed with the method of calibration, bridging and merging. Ensemble rainfall forecasts force a monthly rainfall-runoff model, while a staged hydrological error model quantifies and propagates hydrological forecast uncertainty through forecast lead times. FoGSS is able to generate ensemble streamflow forecasts in the form of monthly time series to a 12-month forecast horizon. FoGSS is tested on 63 Australian catchments that cover a wide range of climates, including 21 ephemeral rivers. In all perennial and many ephemeral catchments, FoGSS provides an effective alternative to resampled historical inflow sequences. FoGSS generally produces skilful forecasts at shorter lead times (< 4 months), and transits to climatologylike forecasts at longer lead times. Forecasts are generally reliable and unbiased. However, FoGSS does not perform well in very dry catchments (catchments that experience zero flows more than half the time in some months), sometimes producing strongly negative forecast skill and poor reliability. We attempt to improve forecasts through the use of (i) ESP rainfall forcings, (ii) different rainfall-runoff mod-els, and (iii) a Bayesian prior to encourage the error model to return climatology forecasts in months when the rainfallrunoff model performs poorly. Of these, the use of the prior offers the clearest benefit in very dry catchments, where it moderates strongly negative forecast skill and reduces bias in some instances. However, the prior does not remedy poor reliability in very dry catchments. Overall, FoGSS is an attractive alternative to historical inflow sequences in all but the driest catchments. We discuss ways in which forecast reliability in very dry catchments could be improved in future work.",https://doi.org/10.5194/hess-21-6007-2017,10.5194/hess-21-6007-2017,"Bennett, James C.; Wang, Quan J.; Robertson, David E.; Schepen, Andrew; Li, Ming; Michael, Kelvin",HYDROLOGY AND EARTH SYSTEM SCIENCES,,PRECIPITATION; RAINFALL; MODEL; SKILL; CALIBRATION; DROUGHT,,COPERNICUS GESELLSCHAFT MBH,GOTTINGEN,"BAHNHOFSALLEE 1E, GOTTINGEN, 37081, GERMANY",1027-5606,1607-7938,,HYDROL EARTH SYST SC,Hydrol.

618,"Postprocessing continental-scale, medium-range ensemble streamflow forecasts in South America using Ensemble Model Output Statistics and Ensemble Copula Coupling","Probabilistic hydrological forecasting and ensemble techniques have leveraged streamflow prediction at regional to continental scales up to several weeks in advance. However, ensembles that only account for meteorological forecast uncertainty are typically biased and subject to dispersion errors, thus limiting their use for rational decision-making and optimization systems. Statistical postprocessing is therefore necessary to convert ensemble forecasts into calibrated and sharp predictive distributions, and it should also account for dependencies between lead times to enable realistic forecast trajectories. This work provides a continental-scale assessment of the use of statistical postprocessing on medium-range, ensemble streamflow forecasts over South America (SA). These forecasts were produced through a large-scale hydrologic-hydrodynamic model forced with a global precipitation dataset and ECMWF reforecast data. The Ensemble Model Output Statistics (EMOS) technique was used to generate conditional predictive distributions in 488 locations at each forecast lead time, while the Ensemble Copula Coupling method with the transformation scheme (ECC-T) was applied to derive ensemble traces from EMOS distributions. Postprocessed streamflow forecasts were cross-validated for the period from 1996 to 2014 using a range of verification metrics. Results showed that the skill and reliability of EMOS forecasts substantially improve over the raw ensembles, and that EMOS leads to skillful predictions relative to discharge climatology and persistence forecasts up to 15 days in advance in most locations. Furthermore, EMOS results in predictive distributions that are generally sharper than the climatology. Limitations in depicting autocorrelations of forecast trajectories were observed in rivers for which the raw ensemble spread is very low and EMOS has to largely increase dispersion, especially at short lead times. The study's findings suggest that combining a continental-scale hydrological model with EMOS and ECC-T methods can lead to skillful predictions and realistic ensemble traces in several locations in SA, even if in situ hydrometeorological observations are not available in real time.",https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jhydrol.2021.126520,10.1016/j.jhydrol.2021.126520,"Siqueira, Vinicius Alencar; Weerts, Albrecht; Klein, Bastian; Fan, Fernando Mainardi; Dias de Paiva, Rodrigo Cauduro; Collischonn, Walter",JOURNAL OF HYDROLOGY,EMOS; ECC; South America; Ensemble forecasting; Post-processing; Medium-range,PREDICTIVE UNCERTAINTY ASSESSMENT; HYDROLOGICAL ENSEMBLE; PROBABILISTIC FORECASTS; CONDITIONAL PROCESSOR; PRECIPITATION; RUNOFF; RESOLUTION; SYSTEM; BASIN; CALIBRATION,,ELSEVIER,AMSTERDAM,"RADARWEG 29, 1043 NX AMSTERDAM, NETHERLANDS",0022-1694,1879-2707,,J HYDROL,J.

619,A hierarchical Bayesian model for regionalized seasonal forecasts: Application to low flows in the northeastern United States,"This study presents a regional, probabilistic framework for seasonal forecasts of extreme low summer flows in the northeastern United States conditioned on antecedent climate and hydrologic conditions. The model is developed to explore three innovations in hierarchical modeling for seasonal forecasting at ungaged sites: (1) predictive climate teleconnections are inferred directly from ocean fields instead of predefined climate indices, (2) a parsimonious modeling structure is introduced to allow climate teleconnections to vary spatially across streamflow gages, and (3) climate teleconnections and antecedent hydrologic conditions are considered jointly for regional forecast development. The proposed model is developed and calibrated in a hierarchical Bayesian framework to pool regional information across sites and enhance regionalization skill. The model is validated in a cross-validation framework along with five simpler nested formulations to test specific hypotheses embedded in the full model structure. Results indicate that each of the three innovations improve out-of-sample summer low-flow forecasts, with the greatest benefits derived from the spatially heterogeneous effect of climate teleconnections. We conclude with a discussion of possible model improvements from a better representation of antecedent hydrologic conditions at ungaged sites.",https://doi.org/10.1002/2016WR019605,10.1002/2016WR019605,"Ahn, Kuk-Hyun; Palmer, Richard; Steinschneider, Scott",WATER RESOURCES RESEARCH,seasonal forecast; regionalization; low flow; hierarchical Bayesian,FLOOD FREQUENCY-ANALYSIS; INCORPORATING SPATIAL DEPENDENCE; CONNECTICUT RIVER-BASIN; LAND-USE CHANGE; REGRESSION TECHNIQUES; UNGAUGED SITES; ANNUAL MAXIMUM; L-MOMENTS; CLIMATE; VARIABILITY,,AMER GEOPHYSICAL UNION,WASHINGTON,"2000 FLORIDA AVE NW, WASHINGTON, DC 20009 USA",0043-1397,1944-7973,,WATER RESOUR RES,Water Resour.

620,A systematic literature review of forecasting and predictive models for cyanobacteria blooms in freshwater lakes,"Cyanobacteria harmful blooms (CyanoHABs) in lakes and reservoirs represent a major risk for water authorities globally due to their toxicity and economic impacts. Anticipating bloom occurrence and understanding the main drivers of CyanoHABs are needed to optimize water resources management. An extensive review of the application of CyanoHABs forecasting and predictive models was performed, and a summary of the current state of knowledge, limitations and research opportunities on this topic is provided through analysis of case studies. Two modelling approaches were used to achieve CyanoHABs anticipation; process-based (PB) and data-driven (DD) models. The objective of the model was a determining factor for the choice of modelling approach. PB models were more frequently used to predict future scenarios whereas DD models were employed for short-term forecasts. Each modelling approach presented multiple variations that may be applied for more specific, targeted purposes. Most models reviewed were site-specific. The monitoring methodologies, including data frequency, uncertainty and precision, were identified as a major limitation to improve model performance. A lack of standardization of both model output and performance metrics was observed. CyanoHAB modelling is an interdisciplinary topic and communication between disciplines should be improved to facilitate model comparisons. These shortcomings can hinder the adoption of modelling tools by practitioners. We suggest that water managers should focus on generalising models for lakes with similar characteristics and where possible use high frequency monitoring for model development and validation.

An ARIMA (Autoregressive Integrated Moving Average) model is thus proposed for daily water level forecasting at three stations in the middle reach of the Yangtze River. The model is trained and calibrated using a historic dataset of four years (2012-2015). Predictive performance of the ARIMA model is evaluated statistically by a dataset of year 2016. Satisfactory model predictions have been obtained in the study area although some discrepancies have been observed when sharp fluctuations of water level occur. The model accuracy is explored in terms of root mean square error (RMSE), mean absolute percentage error (MAPE), percent of bias (PBIAS) and the index of agreement (d). Moreover, the influence of forecasting period on the model accuracy is further investigated. It is found that the model accuracy decreases as the forecasting period is extended. Considering the simplicity and efficiency of the ARIMA, it provides an effective way of short term water level forecasting and shows potential to be extended for alternative research aims.",https://doi.org/,,"Yu, Zhen; Lei, Guoping; Jiang, Zhonglian; Liu, Fengyang",2017 4TH INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE ON TRANSPORTATION INFORMATION AND SAFETY (ICTIS),ARIMA; forecasting; water level; Yangtze River,RESERVOIR; INFLOW,,IEEE,NEW YORK,"345 E 47TH ST, NEW YORK, NY 10017 USA",,,978-1-5386-0437-3,,,,2017,,,172,177,,
622,Prediction of landscape pattern changes in a coastal river basin in south-eastern China,"Different landscapes in a river basin make different contributions to non-point source pollution according to the source-sink theory. Changes in landscape pattern have a considerable impact on river water quality. Precise predictions of the future landscape pattern provide strong support for manipulating land use patterns, which is beneficial for sustainable development in the watershed. The Jiulong River Basin in south-eastern China was selected as the study area. The Random Forest classifier, which combined textural characteristics with spectral information, was applied to interpret the landscapes from Landsat images acquired in 1995, 2005 and 2015 in this paper. The overall classification accuracy reached 86%, and the Kappa index was higher than 0.83, which was better than the accuracy of classifiers based on the exclusive use of spectral information. We used a hybrid cellular automaton-Markov (CA-Markov) model to simulate the landscape pattern of the Jiulong River Basin in 2015 and verified the accuracy according to the interpreted landscape classification map in 2015. The pixels that were predicted to the correct landscape account for 88.35% of total pixels, and the Kappa coefficient was 0.88, indicating that the CA-Markov model was credible for predicting the future landscape pattern in the Jiulong River Basin. The CA-Markov model was applied to forecast the landscape pattern of this watershed in 2025, and the transition area matrix from 2015 to 2025 was obtained. The predicted results demonstrated the imbalanced migration of source-sink landscapes in the future, which indicated the deterioration of water quality in the study area. Hence, government regulators need rational manipulation of the landscape pattern for sustainable development in the Jiulong River Basin.",https://doi.org/10.1007/s13762-018-2170-4,10.1007/s13762-018-2170-4,"Zhang, X.; Zhou, L.; Zheng, Q.",INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY,Non-point source pollution; Source-sink; Landscape pattern; Prediction; CA-Markov model,NONPOINT-SOURCE POLLUTION; RANDOM FOREST CLASSIFIER; WATER-QUALITY,,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"233 SPRING ST, NEW YORK, NY 10013 USA",1735-1472,1735-2630,,INT J ENVIRON SCI TE,Int.

623,A Deep Learning Approach to Short-Term Quantitative Precipitation Forecasting,"Short-term, spatially distributed quantitative precipitation forecasting (SD-QPF), or 'precipitation nowcasting', is important for hydrological and water resources applications, such as flash flood warning systems and operations of dams and reservoirs. The stateof-the-art methods in SD-QPF include radar extrapolations, numerical weather prediction (NWP) models, and hybrid methods that combine the two. Despite the diversity of methods that have been used, SD-QPF remains difficult: even sophisticated methods may not be able to consistently outperform relatively simple baselines such as Persistence. Methods in Deep Learning (DL) have demonstrated significant and often unexpected improvements across a wide variety of domains ranging from image and video processing to machine translation and speech recognition. Emerging research has suggested that that DL may improve point predictions in the context of very short-term - 0-2 hours - distributed QPF (VSD-QPF) by taking advantage of growing data from in-situ weather sensors as well as remote sensors such as radar and satellites, along with advances in computing. Here we examine the hypothesis that DL can improve VSD-QPF, specifically point predictions, based on observed hourly precipitation data over the contiguous United States, by leveraging a Convolutional Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) recurrent neural network for 1-hour precipitation nowcasting. We find the DL approach performs better than the baseline method of Persistence and a state-of-the-art method using Optical Flow.",https://doi.org/10.1145/3429309.3429311,10.1145/3429309.3429311,"Yadav, Nishant; Ganguly, Auroop R.",PROCEEDINGS OF 2020 10TH INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE ON CLIMATE INFORMATICS (CI2020),deep learning; optical flow; precipitation forecasting,NEURAL-NETWORKS; BLACK-BOX; RADAR; PREDICTABILITY; MODELS,,ASSOC COMPUTING MACHINERY,NEW YORK,"1515 BROADWAY, NEW YORK, NY 10036-9998 USA",,,978-1-4503-8848-1,,,,2020,,,8,14,,
624,"Estimation of suspended matter concentration in manwan reservoir, lancang river using remotely sensed small satellite constellation for environment and disaster monitoring and forecasting (HJ-1A/1B), charge coupled device (CCD) data","The estimation of total suspended matter (TSM) concentration is crucial in monitoring, evaluating, and protecting water quality. Many empirical and semi-analytical models have been established for clear or extremely turbid water bodies; however, only a few are applicable to inland, extremely turbulent deep rivers. Using in situ data from the water of the Manwan reservoir, we developed a robust algorithm to estimate the TSM concentration in the Manwan reservoir, with a root mean square error (RMSE) <= 4.43 mg L-1 and a mean absolute percentage error (MAPE) of 23.2%, indicating the feasibility of the empirical model for estimating TSM. The empirical model was then applied to 251 Small Satellite Constellation for Environment and Disaster Monitoring and Forecasting loaded with the Charge Coupled Device (HJ-CCD) images to derive TSM distribution maps from 2009 to 2018. The estimated TSM concentrations exhibited significant spatial and seasonal changes, revealing relationships among TSM, wind speed, and precipitation. The spatial heterogeneity was significantly higher downstream than upstream in the reservoir due to watershed inputs and anthropogenic dredging activity. The temporal heterogeneity of TSM, significantly higher in summer and autumn than in winter and spring, was mainly caused by seasonal rainfall.

625,Combination Model of Empirical Mode Decomposition and SVM for River Flow Forecasting,"A reliable prediction of river flow is always important for sound planning and smooth operation of the water resource system. In this study, a combination models based on Empirical Mode Decomposition (EMD) and Support Vector Machine (SVM) model referred as EMD-SVM is proposed for estimating future value of monthly river flow data. The proposed EMD-SVM has three important stages. The first stage, the data were decomposed into several numbers of Intrinsic Mode Functions (IMF) and a residual using EMD technique. In the second stage, the meaningful signals are identified using a statistical measure and the new dataset are obtained in this stage. The final stage applied SVM as forecasting tool to perform the river flow forecasting. To assess the effectiveness of EMD-SVM model, Selangor and Bernam Rivers were used as case studies. The experiment results stated that the proposed EMD-SVM have outperformed other model based on Mean Absolute Error (MAE), Root Mean Square Error (RMSE), and Correlation Coefficient (r). This indicating that EMD-SVM is a useful tool to predict complex time series with non-stationary and nonlinearity issues as well as a promising new method for river flow forecasting.",https://doi.org/10.1063/1.4980989,10.1063/1.4980989,"Ismail, Shuhaida; Shabri, Ani",4TH INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE ON MATHEMATICAL SCIENCES (ICMS4): MATHEMATICAL SCIENCES: CHAMPIONING THE WAY IN A PROBLEM BASED AND DATA DRIVEN SOCIETY,,SUPPORT VECTOR REGRESSION; RUNOFF,,AMER INST PHYSICS,MELVILLE,"2 HUNTINGTON QUADRANGLE, STE 1NO1, MELVILLE, NY 11747-4501 USA",0094-243X,,978-0-7354-1498-3,AIP CONF PROC,,,2017,1830,,,,80005,
626,Projection on precipitation frequency of different intensities and precipitation amount in the Lancang-Mekong River basin in the 21st century,"In the Lancang-Mekong River basin (LMRB), agriculture, dominating the local economy, faces increasing challenges in water supply under climate change. The projection of future precipitation in this basin is essential for understanding the challenges. In this study, the Weather Research and Forecasting (WRF) model was applied to project the LMRB precipitation. Comparing with the historical period (1986-2005), we analyzed the changes of both the projected precipitation amount and the frequency of rainless (<0.1 mm d(-1)), light rain (0.1-10 mm d(-1)), moderate rain (10-25 mm d(-1)), heavy rain (25-50 mm d(-1)), rainstorm (50-100 mm d(-1)), and heavy rainstorm (>100 mm d(-1)) for three periods, namely the near-term (2016-2035), mid-term (2046-2065), and long-term (2080-2099). The results indicate that the precipitation amount during the wet season (April-October) is expected to increase in most areas of the basin for the three periods. As for the precipitation during the dry season (November-March), an increase is projected in most areas for the near-term, while an increase in the lower reach of the basin and a decrease in the upper and middle reach for the mid-term and long-term. The precipitation reduction is expected to be greatest in Myanmar, Laos, Thailand, and Yunnan province of China for the mid-term. The frequency of precipitation in different intensities has prominent regional and temporal differences. During the wet season, the days of rainless and light rain are expected to decrease in the middle reach, whereas the days of rainstorm and heavy rainstorm increase. This feature is especially strong in southern Thailand, southern Laos and Cambodia in the near-term and in Laos and Thailand for the mid-term and long-term. During the dry season, there are projected increasing rainless days and decreasing days of precipitation for the other intensities in the middle reach, and opposite in the rest area of the basin. These projected precipitation changes have potential various impact in different parts of the basin. The middle reach would likely face increasing flood risks because of more days of rainstorm and heavy rainstorm, as well as more precipitation. Yunnan, Myanmar, Thailand and Laos would probably be the center of drought threatens during the dry season due to the increment of rainless days and the precipitation reduction. Besides, the seawater intrusion during the dry season in the near-term and mid-term would be more serious as a result of the precipitation decrease in southern Vietnam.",https://doi.org/10.1016/j.accre.2021.03.001,10.1016/j.accre.2021.03.001,Sun Chang; Xiao Zi-Niu; Minh Nguyen,ADVANCES IN CLIMATE CHANGE RESEARCH,Precipitation projection; Lancang-Mekong River basin; Precipitation frequency; Precipitation amount; Precipitation intensity,EXTREME DAILY RAINFALL; TEMPERATURE; VARIABILITY,,SCIENCE PRESS,BEIJING,"16 DONGHUANGCHENGGEN NORTH ST, BEIJING, 100717, PEOPLES R CHINA",1674-9278,,,ADV CLIM CHANG RES,Adv.

627,Use of rainfall forecast from a high-resolution global NWP model in a hydrological stream flow model over Narmada river basin during monsoon,"Use of NWP model rainfall forecast is useful for hydrological modelling for river basins for flood and water management. In this study, the SWAT model is applied to the Narmada river basin to estimate the surface runoff. The capability of the model is tested for the south west monsoon season (June-September) of 2016 and validated against the NCUM global NWP model forecast data up to Day-5. Two heavy rainfall events are used for verification of the global model forecast with the observed data. The two verification events occurring during 1 July to 15 July (mean of 15 days) and 30 Aug to 11 Sept (mean of 12 days) are considered. Using Arc GIS sub watershed boundaries, the drainage network, slope, land use map and soil map are generated for the whole Narmada river basin. The surface runoff is computed by forcing with observed rainfall data as well as the NCUM model rainfall forecasts data as input to the SWAT model. Model simulations are compared at five stations of Narmada namely-Balkheri, Sandia, Handia, Hoshangabad and Garudeshwar. Initially, the NCUM model rainfall forecast is compared with the actual observation to evaluate the model performances in terms of bias estimation. Then the surface runoff is computed using the observed rainfall data and NCUM forecast data up to Day-5 and made a comparison to evaluate the SWAT model performances. It is shown that the estimated surface runoff during the two active phases is simulated well with some overestimation during the season. The skill of hydrological simulations is examined during different length of forecasts. It is seen that the SWAT model output performance is related to the NWP rainfall forecast skills. NCUM global NWP model is overestimating rainfall amount (wet bias) by 50-70 mm/day over the basin during the two active phases. Further, in all the days' forecasts, the model is showing wet bias over the upper part of the Narmada river basin and a dry bias over the lower part of the basin. The dry bias is seen to be around 5-35 mm/day.",https://doi.org/10.1007/s40808-018-0436-y,10.1007/s40808-018-0436-y,"Goswami, Suresh Band; Bal, Prasanta Kumar; Mitra, Ashis K.",MODELING EARTH SYSTEMS AND ENVIRONMENT,NWP rainfall forecast; SWAT; Surface runoff; Narmada river basin,SCS-CN METHOD; CLIMATE; RUNOFF,,SPRINGER HEIDELBERG,HEIDELBERG,"TIERGARTENSTRASSE 17, D-69121 HEIDELBERG, GERMANY",2363-6203,2363-6211,,MODEL EARTH SYST ENV,Model.

Either the causes of floods can be natural or anthropogenic but in both cases people have to bear the burden of devastation. The forecasting of water levels of a flood prone river is must in order to minimize the life and property damages. In this paper, we propose a hybrid machine learning model of Adaptive Neuro Fuzzy Inference System (ANFIS) and Genetic algorithm, which is trained on the temperature, precipitation data of two Meteorological stations and water level of the river. Different ANFIS models with different membership functions and optimization techniques are tested and the best performing model is picked for further modification. The parameters of selected ANFIS model are then optimized using the genetic algorithm to get better results. The ANFIS optimized with genetic algorithm showed better results as compared to the conventional ANFIS. (C) 2021 Elsevier Ltd.

629,Research on a coupling model for groundwater depth forecasting,"Groundwater depth forecasting plays an important role in agricultural irrigation, rational utilization of soil and water resources and ecological protection. The groundwater resource system is influenced by multiple factors such as temperature, precipitation, evapotranspiration, surface water recharge and groundwater discharge, it is characterized by randomness and non-stationary. The empirical mode decomposition (EMD) can decompose the signal into sub-signals of different frequencies and can reduce the non-stationary of the original signal, the Elman neural network (ENN) has strong nonlinear approximation ability. Based on the characteristics of the above two methods, the EMD-Elman coupling forecasting model was constructed and applied to groundwater depth forecasting in People's Victory Canal Irrigation District. The results show that EMD-Elman model has better forecasting effect and lower forecasting error and is better than single back propagation neural network model and ENN model. Furthermore, under human over-exploitation, the forecasting accuracy of the EMD-Elman model will be slightly reduced, but the forecasting effect is still in the acceptable range. This research has an important guiding value on revealing People's Victory Canal Irrigation District of groundwater dynamic change rule and provide a new way for groundwater depth forecasting.",https://doi.org/10.5004/dwt.2019.23458,10.5004/dwt.2019.23458,"Song, Chao; Zhang, Xianqi; Hu, Dengkui; Tuo, Wei",DESALINATION AND WATER TREATMENT,EMD; ENN; Groundwater depth; Forecasting; People's victory canal irrigation district,NEURAL-NETWORK; DECOMPOSITION,,DESALINATION PUBL,HOPKINTON,"36 WALCOTT VALLEY DRIVE,, HOPKINTON, MA 01748 USA",1944-3994,1944-3986,,DESALIN WATER TREAT,Desalin.

630,Risks Analysis and Response of Forecast-Based Operation for Ankang Reservoir Flood Control,"With the improvement of short-term flood forecasting and short-term rainfall forecast accuracy, as well as the advance of hydrological and meteorological information collection and collation methods, the reservoir flood regulation method taking rainfall or inflow forecast into consideration is gaining more and more attention. As the index of Forecast-Based Operation (FBO), the forecasted factor plays an important part in determining success or failure of FBO due to its uncertainty and accuracy. In this study, possible risk sources were analyzed considering the process and the characteristics of reservoir flood regulation firstly, and the uncertainty of the forecast information and the FBO risks were discussed based on hypothesis testing. Then, combined with the case study of applying FBO on Ankang Reservoir, in which the forecasted net rainfall was selected as the index of the FBO rules, the probability distribution of the forecasted net rainfall errors was derived as the basis of risk analysis. Finally, FBO risk analysis was conducted based on Monte Carlo method for several real flood processes, while a simulation was also carried out with the Conventional Operation (CO) for contrast. The results indicate that the maximum risk was reduced more than half when FBO was adopted. Consequently, the possible remedial measures were put forward in the case of invalid forecast happened based on simulation and the analysis of the principle of flood regulation. The conclusions and methods in this research provide ideas for real-time flood regulation and risk management of reservoirs.",https://doi.org/10.3390/w11061134,10.3390/w11061134,"Liu, Zhao; Lyu, Jiawei; Jia, Zhifeng; Wang, Lixia; Xu, Bin",WATER,reservoir operation; reservoir flood regulation; uncertainty analysis; risk analysis; remedies,SYSTEM; MANAGEMENT,,MDPI,BASEL,"ST ALBAN-ANLAGE 66, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND",2073-4441,,,WATER-SUI,Water,JUN,2019,11,6,,,,
631,"Evaluation of deep learning algorithm for inflow forecasting: a case study of Durian Tunggal Reservoir, Peninsular Malaysia","Forecasting of reservoir inflow is one of the most vital concerns when it comes to managing water resources at reservoirs to mitigate natural hazards such as flooding. Machine learning (ML) models have become widely prevalent in capturing the complexity of reservoir inflow time-series data. However, the model structure's selection required several trails-and-error processes to identify the optimal architecture to capture the necessary information of various patterns of input-output mapping. In this study, the effectiveness of a deep learning (DL) approach in capturing various input-output patterns is examined and applied to reservoir inflow forecasting. The proposed DL approach has a distinct benefit over classical ML models as all the hidden layers are stacked afterward to train on a diverging set of topologies derived from the previous layer's output. Given the nonlinearity of day-to-day data about reservoir inflow, a deep learning algorithm centered on the long short-term memory (LSTM) and two standard machine learning algorithms, namely support vector machine (SVM) and artificial neural network (ANN), were deployed in this study for forecasting reservoir inflow on a daily basis. The gathered data pertained to historical daily inflow from 01/01/2018 to 31/12/2019. The area of study was Durian Tunggal Reservoir, Melaka, Peninsular Malaysia. The choice of the input set was made on the basis of the autocorrelation function. The formulated model was assessed on the basis of statistical indices, such as mean absolute error (MAE), root mean square error (RMSE), and the coefficient of determination (R-2). The outcomes indicate that the LSTM model performed much better than SVM and ANN. Based on the comparison, LSTM outperformed other models with MAE = 0.088, RMSE = 0.27, and R-2 = 0.91. This research demonstrates that the deep learning technique is an appropriate method for estimating the daily inflow of the Durian Tunggal Reservoir, unlike the standard machine learning models.",https://doi.org/10.1007/s11069-021-04839-x,10.1007/s11069-021-04839-x,"Latif, Sarmad Dashti; Ahmed, Ali Najah; Sathiamurthy, Edlic; Huang, Yuk Feng; El-Shafie, Ahmed",NATURAL HAZARDS,Water resources management; Inflow prediction model; Long short-term memory (LSTM); Artificial neural network (ANN); Support vector machine (SVM); Malaysia,NEURAL-NETWORK; MODEL,,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"ONE NEW YORK PLAZA, SUITE 4600, NEW YORK, NY, UNITED STATES",0921-030X,1573-0840,,NAT HAZARDS,Nat.

632,Hydropower production prediction using artificial neural networks: an Ecuadorian application case,"Hydropower is among the most efficient technologies to produce renewable electrical energy. Hydropower systems present multiple advantages since they provide sustainable and controllable energy. However, hydropower plants' effectiveness is affected by multiple factors such as river/reservoir inflows, temperature, electricity price, among others. The mentioned factors make the prediction and recommendation of a station's operational output a difficult challenge. Therefore, reliable and accurate energy production forecasts are vital and of great importance for capacity planning, scheduling, and power systems operation. This research aims to develop and apply artificial neural network (ANN) models to predict hydroelectric production in Ecuador's short and medium term, considering historical data such as hydropower production and precipitations. For this purpose, two scenarios based on the prediction horizon have been considered, i.e., one-step and multi-step forecasted problems. Sixteen ANN structures based on multilayer perceptron (MLP), long short-term memory (LSTM), and sequence-to-sequence (seq2seq) LSTM were designed. More than 3000 models were configured, trained, and validated using a grid search algorithm based on hyperparameters. The results show that the MLP univariate and differentiated model of one-step scenario outperforms the other architectures analyzed in both scenarios. The obtained model can be an important tool for energy planning and decision-making for sustainable hydropower production.",https://doi.org/10.1007/s00521-021-06746-5,10.1007/s00521-021-06746-5,"Barzola-Monteses, Julio; Gomez-Romero, Juan; Espinoza-Andaluz, Mayken; Fajardo, Waldo",NEURAL COMPUTING & APPLICATIONS,Artificial neural network; Hydropower production forecasting; LSTM; MLP; Monthly electricity production; Sequence to sequence,GENERATION; MODEL,,SPRINGER LONDON LTD,LONDON,"236 GRAYS INN RD, 6TH FLOOR, LONDON WC1X 8HL, ENGLAND",0941-0643,1433-3058,,NEURAL COMPUT APPL,Neural Comput.

633,Ensemble gene expression programming: a new approach for evolution of parsimonious streamflow forecasting model,"A precise forecast of streamflow in intermittent rivers is of major difficulties and challenges in watershed management, particularly in arid and semiarid regions. The present research study introduces an ensemble gene expression programming (EGEP) modeling approach to 1- and 2-day ahead streamflow forecasts that meet both accuracy and simplicity criteria of an applied model. Three main components of the proposed EGEP approach which are capable of producing a parsimonious model include (i) creating a population of suitable solutions using classic genetic programming (GP) instead of a single solution, (ii) combining the solutions throughout gene expression programming, and (iii) parsimony selection based upon trade-off analysis between the complexity and accuracy of the best-evolved solutions at the holdout validation set. The EGEP model was trained and verified using the streamflow measurements from the Shahrchay River lying northwest of Iran. Several statistical indicators were computed for verification of the ensemble models' accuracy with that of classic GP and artificial neural network models developed as the benchmarks. Our results revealed that the EGEP outperforms the benchmarks. It is an explicit, simple, and precise approach and, therefore, worthy to be used in practice.",https://doi.org/10.1007/s00704-019-02982-x,10.1007/s00704-019-02982-x,"Rahmani-Rezaeieh, Aidin; Mohammadi, Mirali; Danandeh Mehr, Ali",THEORETICAL AND APPLIED CLIMATOLOGY,,ARTIFICIAL-INTELLIGENCE METHODS; NEURAL-NETWORKS; WAVELET; PERFORMANCE; PREDICTION; PARADIGM; ANN,,SPRINGER WIEN,WIEN,"SACHSENPLATZ 4-6, PO BOX 89, A-1201 WIEN, AUSTRIA",0177-798X,1434-4483,,THEOR APPL CLIMATOL,Theor.

634,Seasonal predictability of water resources in a Mediterranean freshwater reservoir and assessment of its utility for end-users0,"In this study we explore the seasonal predictability of water resources in a Mediterranean environment (the Boadella reservoir, in north-eastern Spain). Its utility for end-users is assessed through the analysis of economic value curve areas (EVA). Firstly, we have built monthly multiple linear regression (MLR) models for the in-flow, out-flow and volume anomalies by identifying the underlying relationships between these predictands and their potential predictors, both meteorological and human influenced: rainfall, maximum and minimum temperatures, reservoir volume and discharge. Subsequently, we have forecast the monthly anomalies with these models for the period 1981-2010 (up to seven months ahead). We have tested the aforementioned models with four strategies in a leave-one-out cross-validation procedure (LOOCV): a) Climatology (Clim.), b) persistence (Pers.), c) antecedent observations + climatology (A + Clim.), d) antecedent observations + European Centre for Medium-range Weather Forecasts (ECMWF) System 4 anomalies (A + S4). Climatology is the operational strategy against which the other approximations are compared. The second and third approaches only use observations as input data. Finally, the last one combines both observations and ECMWF System 4 forecasts. The LOOCV revealed that reservoir volume is the variable best described by the MLR models, followed by in-flow and out-flow anomalies. In the case of volume anomalies, the predictability displayed provides added value with respect to climatology with a minimum of four months in advance. For in-flow and out-flow this is true at one month ahead, and regarding the latter variable we encounter enhanced predictability also at longer horizons for the summer months, when water demands peak (a valuable result for end-users). Hence, there is a window of opportunity to develop future operational frameworks that could outperform the use of climatology for these variables and forecast horizons. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V.

635,Evaluating skill and robustness of seasonal meteorological and hydrological drought forecasts at the catchment scale - Case Catalonia (Spain),"Robust sub-seasonal and seasonal drought forecasts are essential for water managers and stakeholders coping with water shortage. Many studies have been conducted to evaluate the performance of hydrological forecasts, that is, streamflow. Nevertheless, only few studies evaluated the performance of hydrological drought forecasts. The objective of this study, therefore, is to analyse the skill and robustness of meteorological and hydrological drought forecasts on a catchment scale (the Ter and Llobregat rivers in Catalonia, Spain), rather than on a continental or global scale. Meteorological droughts were forecasted using downscaled (5 km) probabilistic weather reforecasts (ECMWF-SEAS4). These downscaled data were also used to produce hydrological drought forecasts, derived from time series of streamflow data simulated with a hydrological model (LISFLOOD). This resulted in seasonal hydro-meteorological reforecasts with a lead time up to 7 months, for the time period 2002-2010. These monthly reforecasts were compared to two datasets: (1) droughts derived from a proxy for observed data, including gridded precipitation data and discharge simulated by the LISFLOOD model, fed by these gridded climatological data; and (2) droughts derived from in situ observed precipitation and discharge. Results showed that the skill of hydrological drought forecasts is higher than the climatology, up to 3-4 months lead time. On the contrary, meteorological drought forecasts, analysed using the Standardized Precipitation Index (SPI), do not show added value for short accumulation times (SPI1 and SPI3). The robustness analysis showed that using either a less extreme or a more extreme threshold leads to a large change in forecasting skill, which points at a rather low robustness of the hydrological drought forecasts. Because the skill found in hydrological drought forecasts is higher than the meteorological ones in this case study, the use of hydrological drought forecasts in Catalonia is highly recommended for management of water resources.",https://doi.org/10.1016/j.envint.2019.105206,10.1016/j.envint.2019.105206,"Van Hateren, Theresa C.; Sutanto, Samuel J.; Van Lanen, Henny A.

636,Evaluation of a global ensemble flood prediction system in Peru,"Flood early warning systems play a more substantial role in risk mitigation than ever before. Hydrological forecasts, which are an essential part of these systems, are used to trigger action against floods around the world. This research presents an evaluation framework, where the skills of the Global Flood Awareness System (GloFAS) are assessed in Peru for the years 2009-2015. Simulated GloFAS discharges are compared against observed ones for 10 river gauges. Forecasts skills are assessed from two perspectives: (i) by calculating verification scores at every river section against simulated discharges and (ii) by comparing the flood signals against reported events. On average, river sections with higher discharges and larger upstream areas perform better. Raw forecasts provide correct flood signals for 82% of the reported floods, but exhibit low verification scores. Post-processing of raw forecasts improves most verification scores, but reduces the percentage of the correctly forecasted reported events to 65%.",https://doi.org/10.1080/02626667.2019.1617868,10.1080/02626667.2019.1617868,"Bischiniotis, Konstantinos; van den Hurk, Bart; Zsoter, Ervin; de Perez, Erin Coughlan; Grillakis, Manolis; Aerts, Jeroen C.

637,A data-driven model for real-time water quality prediction and early warning by an integration method,"Due to increasingly serious deterioration of surface water quality, effective water quality prediction technique for real-time early warning is essential to guarantee the emergency response ability in advance for sustainable water management. In this study, an effective data-driven model for surface water quality prediction is developed to analyze the inherent water quality variation tendencies and provide real-time early warnings according to the historical observation data. The developed data-driven model is integrated by an improved genetic algorithm (IGA) for selecting optimal initial weight parameters of neural a network and a back-propagation neural network (BPNN) for adjusting appropriate connection architectures of neural network. First, improved genetic algorithm is used to optimize the reasonable initial weight parameters and prevent the developed model from selecting a local optimal result. Second, BPNN is applied to adjust appropriate connection architectures and identify the features of water quality variation. The developed model is then applied to forecast the surface water quality variations for real-time early warning in Ashi River, China, comparing with simple BPNN model. The prediction results demonstrate that the developed data-driven model can significantly improve the prediction performance both in prediction accuracy and reliability, and effectively provide real-time early warning for emergency response.",https://doi.org/10.1007/s11356-019-06049-2,10.1007/s11356-019-06049-2,"Jin, Tao; Cai, Shaobin; Jiang, Dexun; Liu, Jie",ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE AND POLLUTION RESEARCH,Surface water quality; Water quality prediction; Early warning; Improved genetic algorithm; Back-propagation neural network,ARTIFICIAL NEURAL-NETWORK; RIVER-BASIN; SYSTEM; RESERVOIR; RISK,,SPRINGER HEIDELBERG,HEIDELBERG,"TIERGARTENSTRASSE 17, D-69121 HEIDELBERG, GERMANY",0944-1344,1614-7499,,ENVIRON SCI POLLUT R,Environ.

638,Rainfall Prediction of Cimanuk Watershed Regions with Canonical Correlation Analysis (CCA),"Rainfall prediction in Indonesia is very influential on various development sectors, such as agriculture, fisheries, water resources, industry, and other sectors. The inaccurate predictions can lead to negative effects. Cimanuk watershed is one of the main pillar of water resources in West Java. This watersheds divided into three parts, which is a headwater of Cimanuk sub-watershed, Middle of Cimanuk sub-watershed and downstream of Cimanuk subwatershed. The flow of this watershed will flow through the Jatigede reservoir and will supply water to the north-coast area in the next few years. So, the reliable model of rainfall prediction is very needed in this watershed. Rainfall prediction conducted with Canonical Correlation Analysis (CCA) method using Climate Predictability Tool (CPT) software. The prediction is every 3months on 2016 (after January) based on Climate Hazards group Infrared Precipitation with Stations (CHIRPS) data over West Java. Predictors used in CPT were the monthly data index of Nino3.4, Dipole Mode (DMI), and Monsoon Index (AUSMI-ISMI-WNPMI-WYMI) with initial condition January. The initial condition is chosen by the last data update. While, the predictant were monthly rainfall data CHIRPS region of West Java. The results of prediction rainfall showed by skill map from Pearson Correlation. High correlation of skill map are on MAM (Mar-Apr-May), AMJ (Apr-May-Jun), and JJA (Jun-Jul-Aug) which means the model is reliable to forecast rainfall distribution over Cimanuk watersheds region (over West Java) on those seasons.

639,A generic data-driven technique for forecasting of reservoir inflow: Application for hydropower maximization,"A generic and scalable scheme is proposed for forecasting reservoir inflow to optimize reservoir operations for hydropower maximization. Short-term weather forecasts and antecedent hydrological variables were inputs to a three-layered hydrologically-relevant Artificial Neural Network (ANN) to forecast inflow for 7-days of lead-time. Application of the scheme was demonstrated over 23 dams in U.S. with varying hydrological characteristics and climate regimes. Probabilistic forecast was also explored by feeding ANN with ensembles of weather forecast fields. Results suggest forecasting skill improves with decreasing coefficient of variation in inflow and increasing drainage area. Forecast-informed operations were simulated using a rolling horizon scheme and assessed against benchmark control rules. Over two years of operations from Pensacola dam (Oklahoma), additional 47,253 MWh of energy could have been harvested without compromising flood risk with optimal operations. This study reinforces the potential of a numerically efficient and skillful reservoir inflow forecasting scheme to address water-energy security challenges.",https://doi.org/10.1016/j.envsoft.2019.06.008,10.1016/j.envsoft.2019.06.008,"Ahmad, Shahryar Khalique; Hussain, Faisal",ENVIRONMENTAL MODELLING & SOFTWARE,Reservoir inflow forecasting; Artificial neural network; Numerical weather prediction; Baseflow separation; Hydropower maximization; Global scalability,ARTIFICIAL NEURAL-NETWORKS; 10 ITERATIVE STEPS; SUSTAINABLE DEVELOPMENT; STREAMFLOW PREDICTION; GENETIC ALGORITHM; MODEL DEVELOPMENT; R-PACKAGE; OPTIMIZATION; PERFORMANCE; OPERATIONS,,ELSEVIER SCI LTD,OXFORD,"THE BOULEVARD, LANGFORD LANE, KIDLINGTON, OXFORD OX5 1GB, OXON, ENGLAND",1364-8152,1873-6726,,ENVIRON MODELL SOFTW,Environ.

The results showed that (80% reliability): MODIS image can be used to monitor the progress of flood in large areas of the Mekong River Basin. There was a close relationship between enhanced vegetation index EVI, land surface water index LSWI with growth status of plants and surface water of the flood. Risk flood maps during the flood season of the study area were established as the basis for developing the flood forecasting method applied to the Mekong Delta. With accuracy about 91%, this flood forecast method opened a new direction for researching about environmental disasters using the resource of satellite image at low cost.

641,Effect of hydroclimatological teleconnections on the watershed-scale drought predictability in the southeastern United States,"Large-scale atmospheric circulation patterns have a strong influence on hydrologic variability in the southeastern United States (SEUS). These climatic indices are often linked with anomalous climatic conditions and thus can be useful to forecast either water surplus or deficit conditions over the region. This study provides an assessment of the watershed-scale influence of hydroclimatological teleconnections in the context of drought predictability. The interrelationship between several climate indices is assessed with the monthly percentiles of soil water storage (SW), precipitation (PCP), surface run-off (SURQ), and potential evapotranspiration (PET) for 50 watersheds in the South Atlantic Gulf region of the SEUS. The hydrologic variables are simulated by implementing SWAT models for each watershed at a HUC-12 resolution for a period of January 1982 through December 2013. The study highlights the strong correlation between the climate indices and watershed-scale hydrologic variables and provides important insights on the effect of seasonality and the dynamics of water balance components on the predictability of drought at watershed-scale. Among all hydrologic variables evaluated, soil moisture shows a stronger relationship with the climate indices compared to PCP, SW, and SURQ. The interrelationship between watershed hydrology and climate indices is found to be stronger during fall (September-November) and winter seasons (December-February) with high correlation of SW and PCP with the climate indices, especially in the Carolinas, Georgia, and parts of Florida. Simulated SW corresponds strongly with the Palmer drought severity index (PDSI) in terms of its response to climate indices, indicating that SW can be an effective predictor of drought in the region.",https://doi.org/10.1002/joc.5439,10.1002/joc.5439,"Sehgal, Vinit; Sridhar, Venkataramana",INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF CLIMATOLOGY,hydroclimatology; drought predictability; teleconnections; ENSO; PDSI; SWAT; southeastern United States,ATLANTIC MULTIDECADAL OSCILLATION; NINO-SOUTHERN-OSCILLATION; SEA-SURFACE TEMPERATURES; TROPICAL CYCLONES; RIVER-BASIN; TRANSPORT PARAMETERS; MODEL PERFORMANCE; VARIABILITY; CLIMATE; ENSO,,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0899-8418,1097-0088,,INT J CLIMATOL,Int.

642,Evaluation of Atmospheric River Predictions by the WRF Model Using Aircraft and Regional Mesonet Observations of Orographic Precipitation and Its Forcing,"Accurate forecasts of precipitation during landfalling atmospheric rivers (ARs) are critical because ARs play a large role in water supply and flooding for many regions. In this study, we have used hundreds of observations to verify global and regional model forecasts of atmospheric rivers making landfall in Northern California and offshore in the midlatitude northeast Pacific Ocean. We have characterized forecast error and the predictability limit in AR water vapor transport, static stability, onshore precipitation, and standard atmospheric fields. Analysis is also presented that apportions the role of orographic forcing and precipitation response in driving errors in forecast precipitation after AR landfall. It is found that the global model and the higher-resolution regional model reach their predictability limit in forecasting the atmospheric state during ARs at similar lead times, and both present similar and important errors in low-level water vapor flux, moist-static stability, and precipitation. However, the relative contribution of forcing and response to the incurred precipitation error is very different in the two models. It can be demonstrated using the analysis presented herein that improving water vapor transport accuracy can significantly reduce regional model precipitation errors during ARs, while the same cannot be demonstrated for the global model.",https://doi.org/10.1175/JHM-D-17-0098.1,10.1175/JHM-D-17-0098.1,"Martin, Andrew; Ralph, F.

This paper aims to provide an appropriate methodology for long-term prediction for the water flow and water level parameters of the Shannon river in Ireland over a 30-year period from 1983-2013 through a framework that is composed of three phases: city wide scale analytics, data fusion, and domain knowledge data analytics phase which is the main focus of the paper that employs a machine learning model based on deep convolutional neural networks (DeepCNNs). We test our proposed deep learning model on three different water stations across the Shannon river and show it out-performs four well-known time-series forecasting models. We finally show how the proposed model simulate the predicted water flow and water level from 2013-2080. Our proposed solution can be very useful for the water authorities for better planning the future allocation of water resources among competing users such as agriculture, demotic and power stations. In addition, it can be used for capturing abnormalities by setting and comparing thresholds to the predicted water flow and water level.",https://doi.org/10.1007/978-3-319-71273-4_26,10.1007/978-3-319-71273-4_26,"Assem, Haytham; Ghariba, Salem; Makrai, Gabor; Johnston, Paul; Gill, Laurence; Pilla, Francesco","MACHINE LEARNING AND KNOWLEDGE DISCOVERY IN DATABASES, ECML PKDD 2017, PT III",Deep learning; Water management; Convolutional neural networks; Urban computing,SUPPORT VECTOR MACHINE,,SPRINGER INTERNATIONAL PUBLISHING AG,CHAM,"GEWERBESTRASSE 11, CHAM, CH-6330, SWITZERLAND",0302-9743,1611-3349,978-3-319-71273-4; 978-3-319-71272-7,LECT NOTES ARTIF INT,,,2017,10536,,317,329,,
644,The China Multi-Model Ensemble Prediction System and Its Application to Flood-Season Prediction in 2018,"Multi-model ensemble prediction is an effective approach for improving the prediction skill short-term climate prediction and evaluating related uncertainties. Based on a combination of localized operation outputs of Chinese climate models and imported forecast data of some international operational models, the National Climate Center of the China Meteorological Administration has established the China multi-model ensemble prediction system version 1.0 (CMMEv1.0) for monthly-seasonal prediction of primary climate variability modes and climate elements. We verified the real-time forecasts of CMMEv1.0 for the 2018 flood season (June-August) starting from March 2018 and evaluated the 1991-2016 hindcasts of CMMEv1.0. The results show that CMMEv1.0 has a significantly high prediction skill for global sea surface temperature (SST) anomalies, especially for the El Nino-Southern Oscillation (EN-SO) in the tropical central-eastern Pacific. Additionally, its prediction skill for the North Atlantic SST triple (NAST) mode is high, but is relatively low for the Indian Ocean Dipole (IOD) mode. Moreover, CMMEv1.0 has high skills in predicting the western Pacific subtropical high (WPSH) and East Asian summer monsoon (EASM) in the June-July-August (JJA) season. The JJA air temperature in the CMMEv1.0 is predicted with a fairly high skill in most regions of China, while the JJA precipitation exhibits some skills only in northwestern and eastern China. For real-time forecasts in March-August 2018, CMMEv1.0 has accurately predicted the ENSO phase transition from cold to neutral in the tropical central-eastern Pacific and captures evolutions of the NAST and IOD indices in general. The system has also captured the main features of the summer WPSH and EASM indices in 2018, except that the predicted EASM is slightly weaker than the observed. Furthermore, CMMEv1.0 has also successfully predicted warmer air temperatures in northern China and captured the primary rainbelt over northern China, except that it predicted much more precipitation in the middle and lower reaches of the Yangtze River than observation.",https://doi.org/10.1007/s13351-019-8154-6,10.1007/s13351-019-8154-6,"Ren, Hong-Li; Wu, Yujie; Bao, Qing; Ma, Jiehua; Liu, Changzheng; Wan, Jianghua; Li, Qiaoping; Wu, Xiaofei; Liu, Ying; Tian, Ben; Fu, Joshua-Xiouhua; Sun, Jianqi",JOURNAL OF METEOROLOGICAL RESEARCH,multi-model ensemble; China multi-model ensemble prediction system (CMME); real-time forecast; skill assessment,INDIAN-OCEAN DIPOLE; WESTERN NORTH PACIFIC; EL-NINO; ENSO PREDICTION; MODEL; IMPACT; PREDICTABILITY; SST; VARIABILITY; ANOMALIES,,SPRINGER HEIDELBERG,HEIDELBERG,"TIERGARTENSTRASSE 17, D-69121 HEIDELBERG, GERMANY",2095-6037,2198-0934,,J METEOROL RES-PRC,J.

645,Ensemble Streamflow Forecasting Using an Energy Balance Snowmelt Model Coupled to a Distributed Hydrologic Model with Assimilation of Snow and Streamflow Observations,"In many river basins across the world, snowmelt is an important source of streamflow. However, detailed snowmelt modeling is hampered by limited input data and uncertainty arising from inadequate model structure and parametrization. Data assimilation that updates model states based on observations, reduces uncertainty and improves streamflow forecasts. In this study, we evaluated the Utah Energy Balance (UEB) snowmelt model coupled to the Sacramento Soil Moisture Accounting (SAC-SMA) and rutpix7 stream routing models, integrated within the Research Distributed Hydrologic Model (RDHM) framework for streamflow forecasting. We implemented an ensemble Kalman filter for assimilation of snow water equivalent (SWE) observations in UEB and a particle filter for assimilation of streamflow to update the SAC-SMA and rutpix7 states. Using leave one out validation, it was shown that the modeled SWE at a location where observations were excluded from data assimilation was improved through assimilation of data from other stations, suggesting that assimilation of sparse observations of SWE has the potential to improve the distributed modeling of SWE over watershed grid cells. In addition, the spatially distributed snow data assimilation improved streamflow forecasts and the forecast volume error was reduced. On the other hand, the assimilation of streamflow observations did not provide additional forecast improvement over that achieved by the SWE assimilation for seasonal forecast volume likely due to there being little information content in streamflow at the forecast date prior to its rising during the melt period and this application of particle filter being better suited for shorter timescales.",https://doi.org/10.1029/2019WR025472,10.1029/2019WR025472,"Gichamo, Tseganeh Z.; Tarboton, David G.",WATER RESOURCES RESEARCH,ensemble streamflow forecast; Utah Energy Balance (UEB) snowmelt model; Research Distributed Hydrologic Model (RDHM); data assimilation; ensemble Kalman filter (EnKF); particle filter (PF),SURFACE-TEMPERATURE; TURBULENT FLUXES; KALMAN FILTER; SOIL-MOISTURE; INFORMATION; PRECIPITATION; FREQUENCY; STATES,,AMER GEOPHYSICAL UNION,WASHINGTON,"2000 FLORIDA AVE NW, WASHINGTON, DC 20009 USA",0043-1397,1944-7973,,WATER RESOUR RES,Water Resour.

646,THE BENEFIT OF USING AN ENSEMBLE OF SEASONAL STREAMFLOW FORECASTS,"The area to be cropped in irrigation districts needs to be planned according to the allocated water, which in turn is a function of the available water resource. However, conservative estimates of the available resource in rivers and reservoirs may lead to unnecessary curtailments in allocated water due to conservative estimates of future (in) flows. Water allocations may be revised as the season progresses, though inconsistency in allocation is undesirable to farmers as they may then not be able to use that water, thus leading to an opportunity cost in agricultural production. In this study we assess the benefit of using reservoir inflow estimates derived from seasonal forecast datasets to improve water allocation decisions. A feedback loop between simulated reservoir storage and emulated water allocations to General Security (water allocated to irrigating) was developed to evaluate two seasonal reservoir inflow forecast datasets (POAMA and ESP), derived from the Forecast Guided Stochastic Scenarios (FoGSS), a 12 month seasonal ensemble forecast in Australia. We evaluate the approach in the Murrumbidgee basin, comparing water allocations obtained with an expected reservoir inflow from FoGSS against the allocations obtained with an expected reservoir inflow from a conservative estimate based on climatology (as currently used by the basin authority), as well as against those obtained using observed inflows (perfect information). The inconsistency in allocated water is evaluated by determining the total changes in allocated water made every 15 days from the initial allocation at the start of the water year to the end of the irrigation season, including both downward and upward revisions of allocations. Results show that the inconsistency due to upward revisions in allocated water is lower when using the forecast datasets (POAMA and ESP) compared to the conservative inflow estimates (reference) which is beneficial to the planning of cropping areas by farmers. Over confidence can, however, lead to an increase in undesirable downward revisions. This is more evident for dry years than for wet years. Even though biases are found in inflow predictions, the accuracy of the available water estimates using the forecast ensemble improves progressively during the water year, especially one and a half months before the start of the cropping season in November, providing additional time for farmers to make key decision on planting.",https://doi.org/,,"Kaune Schmidt, Alexander Jose","VALUE OF USING HYDROLOGICAL DATASETS FOR WATER ALLOCATION DECISIONS: EARTH OBSERVATIONS, HYDROLOGICAL MODELS AND SEASONAL FORECASTS",,,,CRC PRESS-BALKEMA,LEIDEN,"PO BOX 11320, LEIDEN,  South Holland, NETHERLANDS",,,978-94-6395-008-4; 978-0-367-42955-3,,,,2019,,,83,113,,
647,"Flood Routing Model with Particle Filter-Based Data Assimilation for Flash Flood Forecasting in the Micro-Model of Lower Yellow River, China","Reliable real-time flood forecasting is a challenging prerequisite for successful flood protection. This study developed a flood routing model combined with a particle filter-based assimilation model and a one-dimensional hydrodynamic model. This model was applied to an indoor micro-model, using the Lower Yellow River (LYR) as prototype. Real-time observations of the water level from the micro-model were used for data assimilation. The results show that, compared to the traditional hydrodynamic model, the assimilation model could effectively update water level, flow discharge, and roughness coefficient in real time, thus yielding improved results. The mean water levels of the particle posterior distribution are closer to the observed values than before assimilation, even when water levels change greatly. In addition, the calculation results for different lead times indicate that the root mean square error of the forecasting water level gradually increases with increasing lead time. This is because the roughness value changes greatly in response to unsteady water flow, and the incurring error accumulates with the predicted period. The results show that the assimilation model can simulate water level changes in the micro-model and provide both research method and technical support for real flood forecasting in the LYR.",https://doi.org/10.3390/w10111612,10.3390/w10111612,"Chen, Minghong; Pang, Juanjuan; Wu, Pengxiang",WATER,flood forecasting; data assimilation; particle filter algorithm; micro-model; Lower Yellow River,SEQUENTIAL DATA ASSIMILATION; TUTORIAL,,MDPI,BASEL,"ST ALBAN-ANLAGE 66, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND",2073-4441,,,WATER-SUI,Water,NOV,2018,10,11,,,1612,
648,"Groundwater depth monitoring and short-term prediction: applied to El Hamma aquifer system, southeastern Tunisia","In arid and semi-arid areas, such as Tunisia, groundwater depth assessment and monitoring is an important task for groundwater resources sustainable management. The objective of this work is to assess and forecast groundwater depth (GWDs) at short-term, under different impact factors, using stochastic time series (STS) and artificial neural network (ANN). Each model was conceptualized and implemented. Groundwater depth, rainfall, pumping rate and temperature over the period 30years extending from 1986 to 2016 were used. Root mean squared error, bias, R-2, AIC, and BIC were used as sensitivity model performance criteria. Models were implemented, trained, and tested over an observation period and forecasting groundwater depth at short-term over a period 2017-2030. Results show that groundwater abstraction rates increase around 0.46Mm(3)/year, whereas a groundwater depth is in continuously drawdown with a rate of 0.3m/year which requires a monitoring network for sustainable management of water resources. The results are promising and indicate an outstanding suitability of stochastic time series and ANN models for groundwater depth assessment and predictions at short time.

649,"Comparison of Box-Jenkin time series and radial basis function for sodium adsorption rate forecasting; a case study Aras, Sepidrud, Karun, and Mond Rivers","Regarding water consumption for various usage, water quality management is a significant part of water management. Future prediction of water quality parameters is necessary for the planning of water quality management. Sodium adsorption rate (SAR) is a parameter, which has a significant role in irrigation. In the present study, we compared the forecasting of SAR of water in Aras, Sepidrud, Karun, and Mond Rivers, Iran, using autoregressive integrated moving average (ARIMA) time series and radial basis functions (RBF) neural network. We found ARIMA (0,1,1) x (0,1,1)12, ARIMA (0,1,1) (0,1,1)12, ARIMA (0,1,1), and ARIMA ( 0,1,2) x (1,1,1)12 with minimum Akaike's Information Criterion (AIC) of -1.7127, - 1.8177, 2.9317, and 12.44 for SAR prediction of Aras, Sepidrud, Karun, and Mond Rivers, respectively. The residual of the mentioned ARIMA models was independent (p-value > 0.05). Using RBF neural network for SAR forecasting of Aras, Sepidrud, Karun, and Mond Rivers with normalized data, we obtained proper training and testing. Mean squared error (MSE are between 0.00026 and 0.0255) and mean bias error ( MBE are between 0.01566 and 0.0612) for training is very low. Likewise, coefficient of determination (R-2 are between 0.907 and 0.960), index of agreement (IA are between 0.981 and 0.999), and the Nash-Sutcliffe efficiency (E are between 0.964 and 0.999) approach to 1, which describes the reliability of the model's performance. Thirty-six months RBF neural network and 12 months of ARIMA time series of SAR forecasting for Aras River comparatively match to the measured data and forecast error of both RBF and ARIMA were comparable.

651,Long-Range River Discharge Forecasting Using the Gravity Recovery and Climate Experiment,"Diarrheal diseases, notably cholera, have been shown to be related to episodic seasonal variability in river discharge, predominantly low flows, in regions where water and sanitation infrastructure are inadequate. Forecasting river discharge in transboundary international basins a few months in advance remains elusive because the necessary geophysical data are unavailable or are not shared with stakeholders. We hypothesized that river discharge in large river basins is directly related to upstream water conditions that lead to generation of high and low flows. Using the Ganges-Brahmaputra-Meghna Rivers as an example and Bayesian regressive models, we showed that terrestrial water storage (TWS) anomalies from the Gravity Recovery and Climate Experiment (GRACE) can provide reliable estimates of flows, which are essential hydroclimatic variables for predicting endemic cholera, with an overall accuracy of 70% and up to 60 days in advance, without ancillary ground-based data.",https://doi.org/10.1061/(ASCE)WR.1943-5452.0001072,10.1061/(ASCE)WR.1943-5452.0001072,"Khan, Rakibul; Usmani, Moiz; Akanda, Ali; Palash, Wahid; Gao, Yongxuan; Huq, Anwar; Colwell, Rita; Jutla, Antarpreet",JOURNAL OF WATER RESOURCES PLANNING AND MANAGEMENT,Gravity recovery and climate experiment (GRACE); Cholera; Remote sensing; River forecasting,SOUTHERN OSCILLATION; MONSOON RAINFALL; CHOLERA; GRACE; WATER; VARIABILITY; PREDICTION; REGRESSION; EPIDEMIC; BASINS,,ASCE-AMER SOC CIVIL ENGINEERS,RESTON,"1801 ALEXANDER BELL DR, RESTON, VA 20191-4400 USA",0733-9496,1943-5452,,J WATER RES PLAN MAN,J.

652,Efficacy of ANFIS-GOA technique in flood prediction: a case study of Mahanadi river basin in India,"Accurateness in flood prediction is of utmost significance for mitigating catastrophes caused by flood events. Flooding leads to severe civic and financial damage, particularly in large river basins, and mainly affects the downstream regions of a river bed. Artificial Intelligence (Al) models have been effectively utilized as a tool for modelling numerous nonlinear relationships and is suitable to model complex hydrological systems. Therefore, the main purpose of this research is to propose an effective hybrid system by integrating an Adaptive Neuro-Fuzzy Inference System (ANFIS) model with meta-heuristic Grey Wolf Optimization (GWO) and Grasshopper Optimization Algorithm (GOA) for flood prediction in River Mahanadi, India. Robustness of proposed meta-heurestics are assessed by comparing with a conventional ANFIS model focusing on various input combinations considering 50 years of monthly historical flood discharge data. The potential of the Al models is evaluated and compared with observed data in both training and validation sets based on three statistical performance evaluation factors, namely root mean squared error (RMSE), mean squared error (MSE) and Wilmott Index (WI).

653,Flash Flood and Extreme Rainfall Forecast through One-Way Coupling of WRF-SMAP Models: Natural Hazards in Rio de Janeiro State,"Flash floods and extreme rains are destructive phenomena and difficult to forecast. In 2011, the mountainous region of Rio de Janeiro state suffered one of the largest natural hazards in Brazil, affecting more than 300,000 people, leaving more than 900 dead. This article simulates this natural hazard through Quantitative Precipitation Forecasting (QPF) and streamflow forecast ensemble, using 18 combinations of parameterizations between cumulus, microphysics, surface layer, planetary boundary layer, land surface and lateral contour conditions of the Weather Research and Forecasting (WRF) Model, coupling to the Soil Moisture Accounting Procedure (SMAP) hydrological model, seeking to find the best set of parametrizations for the forecasting of extreme events in the region. The results showed rainfall and streamflow forecast were underestimated by the models, reaching an error of 57.4% to QPF and 24.6% error to streamflow, and part of these errors are related to the lack of skill of the atmospheric model in predicting the intensity and the spatial-temporal distribution of rainfall. These results bring to light the limitations of numerical weather prediction, possibly due to the lack of initiatives involving the adaptation of empirical constants, intrinsic in the parametrization models, to the specific atmospheric conditions of each region of the country.",https://doi.org/10.3390/atmos11080834,10.3390/atmos11080834,"da Cunha Luz Barcellos, Priscila; Cataldi, Marcio",ATMOSPHERE,hydrometeorology; WRF; SMAP; flash flood; natural hazards; extreme rainfall quantitative precipitation forecasting; parameterizations,NONSTRUCTURAL MEASURES; CONVECTION; PARAMETERIZATION; SENSITIVITY; PREVENTION; TIME; CITY,,MDPI,BASEL,"ST ALBAN-ANLAGE 66, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND",,2073-4433,,ATMOSPHERE-BASEL,Atmosphere,AUG,2020,11,8,,,834,
654,"Development of an Ice Jam Flood Forecasting System for the Lower Oder RiverRequirements for Real-Time Predictions of Water, Ice and Sediment Transport","Despite ubiquitous warming, the lower Oder River typically freezes over almost every year. Ice jams may occur during freeze-up and ice cover breakup phases, particularly in the middle and lower reaches of the river, with weirs and piers. The slush ice and ice blocks may accumulate to form ice jams, leading to backwater effects and substantial water level rise. The small bottom slope of the lower Oder and the tidal backflow from the Baltic Sea enhance the formation of ice jams during cold weather conditions, jeopardizing the dikes. Therefore, development of an ice jam flood forecasting system for the Oder River is much needed. This commentary presents selected results from an international workshop that took place in Wrocaw (Poland) on 26-27 November 2018 that brought together an international team of experts to explore the requirements and research opportunities in the field of ice jam flood forecasting and risk assessment for the Oder River section along the German-Polish border. The workshop launched a platform for collaboration amongst Canadian, German and Polish scientists, government officials and water managers to pave a way forward for joint research focused on achieving the long-term goal of forecasting, assessing and mitigating ice jam impacts along the lower Oder. German and Polish government agencies are in need of new tools to forecast ice jams and assess their subsequent consequences and risks to communities and ship navigation along a river. Addressing these issues will also help research and ice flood management in a Canadian context. A research program would aim to develop a modelling system by addressing fundamental issues that impede the prediction of ice jam events and their consequences in cold regions.",https://doi.org/10.3390/w11010095,10.3390/w11010095,"Lindenschmidt, Karl-Erich; Carstensen, Dirk; Froehlich, Wolfgang; Hentschel, Bernd; Iwicki, Stefan; Koegel, Michael; Kubicki, Michal; Kundzewicz, Zbigniew W.; Lauschke, Cornelia; Lazarow, Adam; Los, Helena; Marszelewski, Wlodzimierz; Niedzielski, Tomasz; Nowak, Marcin; Pawlowski, Boguslaw; Roers, Michael; Schlaffer, Stefan; Weintrit, Beata",WATER,flood forecasting system; ice breaking; ice jam flooding; river ice monitoring; Oder River; remote sensing,RIVER; PROJECTIONS,,MDPI,BASEL,"ST ALBAN-ANLAGE 66, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND",2073-4441,,,WATER-SUI,Water,JAN,2019,11,1,,,95,
655,A comprehensive comparison of recent developed meta-heuristic algorithms for streamflow time series forecasting problem,"Hydrological models play a crucial role in water planning and decision making. Machine Learning-based models showed several drawbacks for frequent high and a wide range of streamflow records. These models also experience problems during the training process such as over-fitting or trapping in searching for global optima To overcome these limitations, the current study attempts to hybridize the recently developed physics-inspired metaheuristic algorithms (MHAs) such as Equilibrium Optimization (EO), Henry Gases Solubility Optimization (HGSO), and Nuclear Reaction Optimization(NRO) with Multi-layer Perceptron (MLP). These models' accuracy will be inspected to solve the streamflow forecasting problem where the streamflow dataset was collected through 130 years from a station located on the High Aswan Dam (HAD). The performance of proposed models then will be compared with two traditional neural network models(MLP and RNN), and nine well-known hybrid MLP-based models belong to the different branches of the metaheuristic field (evolutionary group, swarm group, and physics group). The internal parameters of the proposed models will be initialized and optimized. Different performance metrics will be used to examine the performance of the proposed models. The stability of the proposed models and the convergence speed will be evaluated. Finally, ranking these models based on different performance evaluations will be carried out. The results show that the models in the group of Physics-MLP are more reliable in capturing the streamflow patterns, followed by the Swarm-MLP group and then by the Evolutionary-MLP group. Finally, among the all employed methods, the NRO has the best accuracy with the lowest RMSE(2.35), MAE(1.356), MAPE(16.747), and the highest WI(0.957), R(0.924), and confidence in forecasting the streamflow of Aswan High Dam. It can be concluded that augmenting the NRO algorithm with MLP can be a reliable tool in forecasting the monthly streamflow with a high level of precision, speed convergence, and high constancy level.

656,"WRF model for precipitation simulation and its application in real-time flood forecasting in the Jinshajiang River Basin, China","An accurate flood forecasting with long lead time can be of great value for flood prevention and utilization. This paper develops a one-way coupled hydro-meteorological modeling system consisting of the mesoscale numerical weather model Weather Research and Forecasting (WRF) model and the Chinese Xinanjiang hydrological model to extend flood forecasting lead time in the Jinshajiang River Basin, which is the largest hydropower base in China. Focusing on four typical precipitation events includes: first, the combinations and mode structures of parameterization schemes of WRF suitable for simulating precipitation in the Jinshajiang River Basin were investigated. Then, the Xinanjiang model was established after calibration and validation to make up the hydro-meteorological system. It was found that the selection of the cloud microphysics scheme and boundary layer scheme has a great impact on precipitation simulation, and only a proper combination of the two schemes could yield accurate simulation effects in the Jinshajiang River Basin and the hydro-meteorological system can provide instructive flood forecasts with long lead time. On the whole, the one-way coupled hydro-meteorological model could be used for precipitation simulation and flood prediction in the Jinshajiang River Basin because of its relatively high precision and long lead time.",https://doi.org/10.1007/s00703-017-0542-9,10.1007/s00703-017-0542-9,"Zhou, Jianzhong; Zhang, Hairong; Zhang, Jianyun; Zeng, Xiaofan; Ye, Lei; Liu, Yi; Tayyab, Muhammad; Chen, Yufan",METEOROLOGY AND ATMOSPHERIC PHYSICS,,PHYSICAL PARAMETERIZATIONS; SCE-UA; SENSITIVITY,,SPRINGER WIEN,WIEN,"SACHSENPLATZ 4-6, PO BOX 89, A-1201 WIEN, AUSTRIA",0177-7971,1436-5065,,METEOROL ATMOS PHYS,Meteorol.

657,Flow forecasting models using hydrologic and hydrometric data,"River flow forecasting is important for successful water resources planning and management. The current study investigated the applicability of the artificial neural network (Ann), adaptive neuro-fuzzy inference system (Anfis), wavelet-Ann (Wann) and wavelet-Anfis (Wanfis) for daily river flow forecasting in Karaj River. Three scenarios were used. In the first scenario, meteorological data were used as input variables for model development. In the second, flow discharge data were used, while the third scenario used a combination of scenarios 1 and 2 as input variables for model development. For each scenario, different combinations of time series were considered. In the Wann and Wanfis models, the effective sub-time series components obtained by discrete wavelet transform were used as the new inputs to Ann and Anfis models to predict daily river flow time series. Wann was found to be the best technique for daily flow prediction throughout this study. The results indicate that the best Wann model (R-test(2) = 0.993, RMSEtest = 0.004) outperformed the best Wanfis model (R-test(2) = 0.976, RMSEtest = 0.008). The results show that only the input structures of scenarios 2 and 3 are efficient input structures for flow prediction in the study area. It was also shown that Wann models are capable of delivering an accurate flow prediction up to the next 4 d.",https://doi.org/10.1680/jwama.14.00146,10.1680/jwama.14.00146,"Alizadeh, Mohamad Javad; Rajaee, Taher; Motahari, Meysam",PROCEEDINGS OF THE INSTITUTION OF CIVIL ENGINEERS-WATER MANAGEMENT,floods & floodworks; hydrology & water resource; river engineering,ARTIFICIAL NEURAL-NETWORKS; RAINFALL-RUNOFF PROCESS; FUZZY COMPUTING TECHNIQUE; TIME-SERIES; WAVELET TRANSFORM; INFERENCE SYSTEM; PREDICTION; RIVER; ALGORITHM; RESERVOIR,,ICE PUBLISHING,WESTMINISTER,"INST CIVIL ENGINEERS, 1 GREAT GEORGE ST, WESTMINISTER SW 1P 3AA, ENGLAND",1741-7589,,,P I CIVIL ENG-WAT M,Proc.

658,Spatio-Temporal Attention LSTM Model for Flood Forecasting,"In order to reduce the loss caused by flood, a large number of researches based on data, algorithms, machine learning and other technical means are used to realize flood forecasting. It will be a kind of flexible research method to realize the flood prediction of small and medium-sized rivers through intelligent models such as neural network. The area of small and medium-sized river basins is relatively small. Precipitation, soil moisture, evaporation and other factors can affect the timely total runoff prediction. However, not all the hydrological features is always valuable for flood forecasting, even at some time, noise of the factors will have larger interference on forecast process. Therefore, dynamic extraction of key feature vectors from various hydrological information plays an important role in flood forecasting. This paper proposed a flood forecasting model (STA-LSTM model) by using long short-term memory model (LSTM) and attention mechanism. We take the Lech river basin in Europe as the experimental basin and the results show that STA-LSTM performs well and has high research value with comparison of support vector machine (SVM),fully connected network (FCN) and original LSTM.",https://doi.org/10.1109/iThings/GreenCom/CPSCom/SmartData.2019.00095,10.1109/iThings/GreenCom/CPSCom/SmartData.2019.00095,"Ding, Yukai; Zhu, Yuelong; Wu, Yirui; Feng, Jun; Cheng, Zirun","2019 INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE ON INTERNET OF THINGS (ITHINGS) AND IEEE GREEN COMPUTING AND COMMUNICATIONS (GREENCOM) AND IEEE CYBER, PHYSICAL AND SOCIAL COMPUTING (CPSCOM) AND IEEE SMART DATA (SMARTDATA)",flood forecasting; neural network; LSTM; spatio-temporal model; attention mechanism,THRESHOLDS,,IEEE,NEW YORK,"345 E 47TH ST, NEW YORK, NY 10017 USA",,,978-1-7281-2980-8,,,,2019,,,458,465,,
659,Methodology for data assimilation in reservoir and production system to improve short- and medium-term forecast,"Numerical reservoir simulation is an important tool that is widely used in the petroleum industry for production forecast and decision-making processes. In a context of integrated production system involving the reservoir, wells, and production facilities, the quality of production forecast depends not only on the quality of reservoir models and well productivity/injectivity but also on the boundary condition for the future extrapolation which, in turn, depends on the production system characteristics. Both systems, reservoir and production facilities, are characterized by uncertain properties and behavior, such as porosity and permeability, among others, for reservoir; pipeline roughness, multiphase flow behavior in pipes, among others, for the production system. This paper proposes a methodology for dynamic data assimilation to reduce uncertainty in both reservoir and production system models to improve short- and medium-term production forecast. The methodology was applied to a benchmark case built using real data from an offshore field in The Campos Basin (Brazil). The results from this study show that it is important to perform data assimilation process in both reservoir and production systems to obtain more reliable production forecasts. We also show that, by focusing on the short- and medium-term production forecast, the production system and reservoir uncertainties cause variability in the production forecast in the same order or magnitude. Based on that, it is recommended to consider multiple solutions of the production system to obtain more realistic production forecasts.",https://doi.org/10.1016/j.petrol.2021.109083,10.1016/j.petrol.2021.109083,"Maschio, Celio; von Hohendorff Filho, Joao Carlos; Schiozer, Denis Jose",JOURNAL OF PETROLEUM SCIENCE AND ENGINEERING,Data assimilation; Uncertainty reduction; Integrated production system; Production forecast,,,ELSEVIER,AMSTERDAM,"RADARWEG 29, 1043 NX AMSTERDAM, NETHERLANDS",0920-4105,1873-4715,,J PETROL SCI ENG,J.

660,Combining k-nearest-neighbor models for annual peak breakup flow forecasting,"In practice, water resources managers and river forecasters often face the problem in identifying from the historical record years that show a similar pattern of weather and river conditions as the current year is following. The k-nearest neighbor (kNN) algorithm is such a type of machine learning method, where no assumptions on the dataset distributions are made, but a minimal (no explicit) training stage is required. This is especially useful in river ice forecasting where weather and river condition indicators often do not obey the typical theoretical assumptions; the complex river ice mechanisms are difficult to directly quantify. However, few applications of kNN to river ice studies have been reported. Since the predictive performance of a single kNN is limited, we combine multiple KNN models (first-level) based on different numbers of inputs which are linearly or nonlinearly correlated to annual peak breakup flow (APBF); we use both simple average methods and kNN models as combining models (second-level), and we apply the kNN-based combination models to APBF forecasting of the Smoky River at Watino, Canada. The Mahalanobis distance is chosen in kNN since neither the standardization of input variables nor the assignments of weights to variables are required. The historical breakup data at this site for the past 33 years (1980 to 2012) were collected to facilitate the performance comparison of models. The results show that both training and validation performances of the combining models are substantially better than those of member models. The proposed framework can be potentially applied to various forecasting problems in water resources management practice.",https://doi.org/10.1016/j.coldregions.2017.08.009,10.1016/j.coldregions.2017.08.009,"Sun, Wei; Trevor, Bernard",COLD REGIONS SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY,River ice; Machine learning; Combination; Forecasting; Flooding; Breakup,ARTIFICIAL NEURAL-NETWORKS; RIVER-ICE BREAKUP; WATER-LEVEL; FEATURE-SELECTION; FORT-MCMURRAY; DELTA; BASIN,,ELSEVIER,AMSTERDAM,"RADARWEG 29, 1043 NX AMSTERDAM, NETHERLANDS",0165-232X,1872-7441,,COLD REG SCI TECHNOL,Cold Reg.

661,"Annual maximum rainfall prediction using frequency analysis for Roorkee, Uttarakhand, India","Rain is a meagre and important hydrological variable in dryland areas. Due to population growth, economic development and urbanization, the demand for water in these areas is increasing day by day and with all available resources, water management becomes more and more crucial. Therefore, rain probability analysis is needed to address a number of water management issues and to prevent crop damage due to deficits or excess rainfall. Scientific rainfall forecasting and crop planning can prove to be an important tool in the hands of farmers for better economic returns. An attempt was made to analyze the frequency of different rainfall data. Frequency analysis helps in determining the expected rainfall. An important step in analyzing the frequency of rainfall is selecting a suitable distribution to represent the depth of the rainfall to investigate the precipitation. The distributions namely, Gumbel, Log Normal, Log Pearson Type III and Van Te Chow were used for the prediction of the maximum annual rainfall. Annual rainfall data for 20 years (1991-2010) were collected from the National Institute of Hydrology (NIH), Roorkee, India. This research attempts to fit several theoretical probability distributions to the maximum annual rainfall for daily, two consecutive days, three consecutive days; and to select the best probability distribution for the prediction of maximum annual rainfall for daily, two consecutive days, three consecutive days.For determination of goodness of fit chi-square, percentage absolute deviation, integral square errorwere carried out by comparing the expected values with the observed values. The results found showed that the Gumbel distribution emerged to be the best fit for the prediction of annual maximum rainfall values of Roorkee for one, two and three consecutive days. The second best fit was Ven Te Chow distribution for one, two and three consecutive days.",https://doi.org/,,"Kaur, Lovepreet; Anvesha; Kumar, Manish; Verma, Suman Lata; Kumar, Pravendra",MAUSAM,Gumbel; Log Pearson Type III; Log normal; Van TeChow; Frequency analysis; Rainfall prediction,,,INDIA METEOROLOGICAL DEPT,NEW DELHI,"MAUSAM BHAWAN, LODI RD, NEW DELHI, 110 003, INDIA",0252-9416,,,MAUSAM,Mausam,APR,2021,72,2,359,372,,
662,Predictive Skill Assessment for Land Water Storage in CMIP5 Decadal Hindcasts by a Global Reconstruction of GRACE Satellite Data,"The evaluation of decadal climate predictions against observations is crucial for their benefit to stakeholders. While the skill of such forecasts has been verified for several atmospheric variables, land hydrological states such as terrestrial water storage (TWS) have not been extensively investigated yet due to a lack of long observational records. Anomalies of TWS are globally observed with the satellite missions GRACE(2002-2017) and GRACE-FO(since 2018). By means of a GRACE-like reconstruction of TWS available over 41 years, we demonstrate that this data type can be used to evaluate the skill of decadal prediction experiments made available from different Earth system models as part of both CMIP5 and CMIP6. Analysis of correlation and root-mean-square deviation (RMSD) reveals that for the global land average the initialized simulations outperform the historical experiments in the first three forecast years. This predominance originates mainly from equatorial regions where we assume a longer influence of initialization due to longer soil memory times. Evaluated for individual grid cells, the initialization has a largely positive effect on the forecast year 1 TWS states; however, a general grid-scale prediction skill for TWS of more than 2 years could not be identified in this study for CMIP5. First results from decadal hindcasts of three CMIP6 models indicate a predictive skill comparable to CMIP5 for the multimodel mean in general, and a distinct positive influence of the improved soil-hydrology scheme implemented in the MPI-ESM for CMIP6 in particular.",https://doi.org/10.1175/JCLI-D-20-0042.1,10.1175/JCLI-D-20-0042.1,"Jensen, Laura; Eicker, Annette; Stacke, Tobias; Dobslaw, Henryk",JOURNAL OF CLIMATE,Water masses/storage; Soil moisture; Satellite observations; Forecast verification/skill,GROUNDWATER DEPLETION; CLIMATE MODEL; COUPLED MODEL; PART I; SIMULATION; VARIABILITY; SCIENCE; VERSION; TRENDS; 1ST,,AMER METEOROLOGICAL SOC,BOSTON,"45 BEACON ST, BOSTON, MA 02108-3693 USA",0894-8755,1520-0442,,J CLIMATE,J.

663,Heavy Rainfall in Paraguay during the 2015/16 Austral Summer: Causes and Subseasonal-to-Seasonal Predictive Skill,"During the austral summer 2015/16, severe flooding displaced over 170 000 people on the Paraguay River system in Paraguay, Argentina, and southern Brazil. These floods were driven by repeated heavy rainfall events in the lower Paraguay River basin. Alternating sequences of enhanced moisture inflow from the South American low-level jet and local convergence associated with baroclinic systems were conducive to mesoscale convective activity and enhanced precipitation. These circulation patterns were favored by cross-time-scale interactions of a very strong El Nino event, an unusually persistent Madden-Julian oscillation in phases 4 and 5, and the presence of a dipole SST anomaly in the central southern Atlantic Ocean. The simultaneous use of seasonal and subseasonal heavy rainfall predictions could have provided decision-makers with useful information about the start of these flooding events from two to four weeks in advance. Probabilistic seasonal forecasts available at the beginning of November successfully indicated heightened probability of heavy rainfall (90th percentile) over southern Paraguay and Brazil for December-February. Raw subseasonal forecasts of heavy rainfall exhibited limited skill at lead times beyond the first two predicted weeks, but a model output statistics approach involving principal component regression substantially improved the spatial distribution of skill for week 3 relative to other methods tested, including extended logistic regressions. A continuous monitoring of climate drivers impacting rainfall in the region, and the use of statistically corrected heavy precipitation seasonal and subseasonal forecasts, may help improve flood preparedness in this and other regions.",https://doi.org/10.1175/JCLI-D-17-0805.1,10.1175/JCLI-D-17-0805.1,"Doss-Gollin, James; Munoz, Angel G.; Mason, Simon J.; Pasten, Max",JOURNAL OF CLIMATE,Atmosphere; South America; Statistical techniques; Forecast verification; skill; Statistical forecasting; Flood events,LOW-LEVEL JET; SOUTHEASTERN SOUTH-AMERICA; ATLANTIC CONVERGENCE ZONE; SEA-SURFACE TEMPERATURE; TIME SCALE INTERACTIONS; EXTREME EVENTS; MONSOON SYSTEM; PROBABILISTIC FORECASTS; LOGISTIC-REGRESSION; SOIL-MOISTURE,,AMER METEOROLOGICAL SOC,BOSTON,"45 BEACON ST, BOSTON, MA 02108-3693 USA",0894-8755,1520-0442,,J CLIMATE,J.

664,Bias-corrected and spatially disaggregated seasonal forecasts: a long-term reference forecast product for the water sector in semi-arid regions,"Seasonal forecasts have the potential to substantially improve water management particularly in water-scarce regions. However, global seasonal forecasts are usually not directly applicable as they are provided at coarse spatial resolutions of at best 36 km and suffer from model biases and drifts. In this study, we therefore apply a bias-correction and spatial-disaggregation (BCSD) approach to seasonal precipitation, temperature and radiation forecasts of the latest long-range seasonal forecasting system SEAS5 of the European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts (ECMWF). As reference we use data from the ERA5-Land offline land surface rerun of the latest ECMWF reanalysis ERA5. Thereby, we correct for model biases and drifts and improve the spatial resolution from 36 km to 0.1 degrees. This is performed for example over four predominately semi-arid study domains across the world, which include the river basins of the Karun (Iran), the Sao Francisco River (Brazil), the Tekeze-Atbara river and Blue Nile (Sudan, Ethiopia and Eritrea), and the Catamayo-Chira river (Ecuador and Peru). Compared against ERA5-Land, the bias-corrected and spatially dis-aggregated forecasts have a higher spatial resolution and show reduced biases and better agreement of spatial patterns than the raw forecasts as well as remarkably reduced lead-dependent drift effects. But our analysis also shows that computing monthly averages from daily bias-corrected forecasts particularly during periods with strong temporal climate gradients or heteroscedasticity can lead to remaining biases especially in the lowest- and highest-lead forecasts. Our SEAS5 BCSD forecasts cover the whole (re-)forecast period from 1981 to 2019 and include bias-corrected and spatially disaggregated daily and monthly ensemble forecasts for precipitation, average, minimum, and maximum temperature as well as for shortwave radiation from the issue date to the next 215 d and 6 months, respectively. This sums up to more than 100 000 forecasted days for each of the 25 (until the year 2016) and 51 (from the year 2017) ensemble members and each of the five analyzed variables.

It is currently the first publicly available daily high-resolution seasonal forecast product that covers multiple regions and variables for such a long period. It hence provides a unique test bed for evaluating the performance of seasonal forecasts over semi-arid regions and as driving data for hydrological, ecosystem or climate impact models.

665,Evaluation of ECMWF mid-range ensemble forecasts of precipitation for the Karun River basin,"Ensemble Prediction Systems (EPSs) are increasingly applied for rainfall forecasts and flooding warning systems. In this paper, these forecasts and their skills are evaluated through relevant criteria, particularly by considering forecast performances for different lead times. Furthermore, to enhance their performance, we propose to preprocess the EPS forecasts' output using bias correction methods. For this aim, forecasts for different ranges of precipitation as well as various climatic conditions are evaluated, which is particularly important for extreme events that can lead to flooding. The Karun River basin in Iran is used as case study, a large area including various climate conditions. The results showed that the performance of European Center for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts (ECMWF) forecasts vary with sub-basin properties, e.g., area and skewness of daily precipitation, and vary across dry to humid regions, between flooding and non-flooding seasons, and different lead times and show the effect of different methods for bias correction on the forecast skill. The forecast skill is decreasing from wet regions towards dry regions and the bias correction was more effective in the flooding season, for which the skill was increased by 40% based on continuous ranked probability skill score (CRPSS). When the precipitation thresholds were increased towards extreme values, the forecast performance of ECMWF became better.",https://doi.org/10.1007/s00704-020-03160-0,10.1007/s00704-020-03160-0,"Abedi, Mozhgan; Shafizadeh-Moghadam, Hossein; Morid, Saeed; Booij, Martijn J.; Delavar, Majid",THEORETICAL AND APPLIED CLIMATOLOGY,,PROBABILITY SCORE; SKILL; PREDICTIONS,,SPRINGER WIEN,WIEN,"SACHSENPLATZ 4-6, PO BOX 89, A-1201 WIEN, AUSTRIA",0177-798X,1434-4483,,THEOR APPL CLIMATOL,Theor.

666,Deep Learning Data-Intelligence Model Based on Adjusted Forecasting Window Scale: Application in Daily Streamflow Simulation,"Streamflow forecasting is essential for hydrological engineering. In accordance with the advancement of computer aids in this field, various machine learning (ML) models have been explored to solve this highly non-stationary, stochastic, and nonlinear problem. In the current research, a newly explored version of an ML model called the long short-term memory (LSTM) was investigated for streamflow prediction using historical data for forecasting for a particular period. For a case study located in a tropical environment, the Kelantan river in the northeast region of the Malaysia Peninsula was selected. The modelling was performed according to several perspectives: (i) The feasibility of applying the developed LSTM model to streamflow prediction was verified, and the performance of the developed LSTM model was compared with the classic backpropagation neural network model; (ii) In the experimental process of applying the LSTM model to the prediction of streamflow, the influence of the training set size on the performance of the developed LSTM model was tested; (iii) The effect of the time interval between the training set and the testing set on the performance of the developed LSTM model was tested; (iv) The effect of the time span of the prediction data on the performance of the developed LSTM model was tested.

Fiji, in particular, is often exposed to extreme rainfall events and associated flooding, with significant impacts on properties, infrastructure, agriculture, and the tourism sector. While these occurrences are often associated with tropical cyclones (TCs), the specific characteristics of TCs that produce extreme rainfall are not well understood. In particular, TC intensity does not appear to be a useful guide in predicting rainfall, since weaker TCs are capable of producing large rainfall compared to more intense systems. Therefore, other TC characteristics, in particular TC track morphology and background climate conditions, may provide more useful insights into what drives TC related extreme rainfall. This study aimed to address this problem by developing a decision tree to identify the most important predictors of TC related extreme rainfall (i.e., 95th percentile) for Fiji. TC attributes considered include; TC duration, the average moving speed of TCs, the minimum distance of TCs from land, seasonality, intensity (wind speed) and the geometry of TCs (i.e., geographical location, shape and length via cluster and sinuosity analyses of TC tracks). In addition, potential predictors based on the phases of Indo-Pacific climate modes were input to the decision tree to represent large scale background conditions. It was found that a TC's minimum distance from land was the most important influence on extreme rainfall, followed by TC cluster grouping, seasonality and duration. The application of this model could result in improved TC risk evaluations and could be used by forecasters and decision-makers on mitigating TC impacts over the Fiji Islands.",https://doi.org/10.1016/j.wace.2021.100405,10.1016/j.wace.2021.100405,"Sharma, Krishneel K.; Verdon-Kidd, Danielle C.; Magee, Andrew D.",WEATHER AND CLIMATE EXTREMES,Extreme rainfall; Fiji Islands; Tropical cyclone tracks; Classification modelling; Decision tree,SOUTHERN ANNULAR MODE; TROPICAL CYCLONES; SOUTHWEST PACIFIC; TRENDS; TRACK; ENSO; CLASSIFICATION; OSCILLATION; DISASTER; SHIFTS,,ELSEVIER,AMSTERDAM,"RADARWEG 29, 1043 NX AMSTERDAM, NETHERLANDS",2212-0947,,,WEATHER CLIM EXTREME,Weather Clim.

668,The performance of classification and forecasting Dong Nai River water quality for sustainable water resources management using neural network techniques,"This study has classified and predicted the water quality for the Dong Nai river at different times. The data mining techniques were used to screen out unreliable data. The neural network model FFNN in the form of architecture I(8)-HL(9)-O(1) has been successfully developed to classify the water quality of the Dong Nai river during the period from 2012 to 2019. For this model, the RMSE values for the training, validation, and test sets are equal to 0.0392, 0.0411, and 0.0423, respectively. Also, the MAPE values for those data sets are 1.241, 1.444, and 1.511, respectively. The models ARIMA(0,1,3)(1,1,1), NAR, NAR-MA, LSTM, and LSTM-MA were used to forecast the water quality according to different time series (months) k = 12 and k = 24 at the monitoring points. The LSTM-MA hybrid model provided faster training time and more reliable forecasts than the ARIMA, NAR, NAR-MA, and LSTM models. The RMSE and MAPE values of the LSTM-MA hybrid model for predicting the forecast set are smaller than those from other models. The LSTM-MA hybrid model was used to classify the water quality over the years 2020 to 2022. The water quality classification derived from the LSTM-MA hybrid model in close agreement with the actual monitoring data. This model becomes reliable and useful for the water quality classification of the Dong Nai River.",https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jhydrol.2021.126099,10.1016/j.jhydrol.2021.126099,Nguyen Hien Than; Che Dinh Ly; Pham Van Tat,JOURNAL OF HYDROLOGY,Classification Water quality; Time series; Dong Nai River; neural network LSTM-MA,SHORT-TERM-MEMORY; PREDICTION; MODEL; INDEX; VARIABLES; POLLUTION; ARIMA; AREA; LSTM,,ELSEVIER,AMSTERDAM,"RADARWEG 29, 1043 NX AMSTERDAM, NETHERLANDS",0022-1694,1879-2707,,J HYDROL,J.

669,In-situ soil moisture data improve seasonal streamflow forecast accuracy in rainfall-dominated watersheds,"Seasonal streamflow forecasting methods are less skillful in rainfall-dominated catchments than snow-dominated catchments, where measurements of water storage in the snowpack enhance predictability. Recent research in snow-dominated catchments showed that forecasts can be further enhanced by also including soil moisture measurements, but the impact of soil moisture data on forecast performance in rainfall-dominated watersheds remains unknown. Our objective was to evaluate the potential improvements gained by including in-situ soil moisture data in seasonal streamflow forecasting models in rainfall-dominated watersheds. Precipitation and soil moisture data from four watersheds in the U.S. were incorporated into a modified principal components analysis and regression method to predict seasonal (4-month) streamflow totals at 0-, 1-, 2-, and 3-month lead times. Forecasts derived from antecedent precipitation alone were often statistically insignificant and explained less than 30% of the variance in seasonal streamflow, as indicated by the Nash-Sutcliffe efficiency coefficient. Conversely, forecast models that included soil moisture information explained up to 87% of seasonal streamflow variance at the 0-month lead time, up to 81% at the 1-month lead time, up to 71% at the 2-month lead time, and up to 52% at the 3-month lead time. The root mean square errors for forecasts which included soil moisture data were on average 55% lower than for those based on antecedent precipitation alone. The soil moisture-based forecasts for rainfall-dominated watersheds exhibited accuracies comparable to those previously reported in snow-dominated watersheds. This new forecast method shows strong potential for use in surface water management in rainfall-dominated regions.",https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jhydrol.2020.125404,10.1016/j.jhydrol.2020.125404,"Wyatt, Briana M.; Ochsner, Tyson E.; Krueger, Erik S.; Jones, Eric T.",JOURNAL OF HYDROLOGY,Principal component analysis and regression; Streamflow forecasting; Soil moisture; Water supply forecasting; Surface water hydrology,RIVER EXPERIMENTAL WATERSHEDS; PRECIPITATION; MODEL; CALIBRATION; GENERATION; SNOW; FLOW,,ELSEVIER,AMSTERDAM,"RADARWEG 29, 1043 NX AMSTERDAM, NETHERLANDS",0022-1694,1879-2707,,J HYDROL,J.

670,"Evaluation of the Climate Forecast System Reanalysis Weather Data for Watershed Modeling in Upper Awash Basin, Ethiopia","Availability of reliable meteorological data for watershed modeling is one of the considerable challenges in the Awash River Basin in Ethiopia. To overcome this challenge, the Climate Forecast System Reanalysis (CFSR) global weather data was evaluated and compared with the limited conventional weather data available in the Upper Awash Basin. The main objective of this study was to search for an optional data source for hydrological modeling, instead of using the limited available data, and for data-scarce areas of the basin. The Soil and Water Assessment Tool model was used to compare the performance of the two weather datasets at simulating monthly streamflow. For calibration, validation, and uncertainty analysis, the sequential uncertainty fitting algorithm was used. The model evaluation statistics showed that the CFSR global weather data performed similarly to the conventional weather data for simulating the observed streamflow at Melka Kunture. At Keleta, where the conventional data is scarce, the CFSR performed better. The CFSR performance at the two sub-basins indicated that it performed better for the large sub-basin, Melka Kunture. Generally, the CFSR weather data are a good addition to the dataset for areas where no reliable weather data exists for hydrological modeling in the basin. The precipitation data of the CFSR are slightly higher than that of the conventional data, which also resulted in a relatively higher water balance components.",https://doi.org/10.3390/w10060725,10.3390/w10060725,"Tolera, Mesfin Benti; Chung, Il-Moon; Chang, Sun Woo",WATER,Climate Forecast System Reanalysis; conventional weather; hydrological modeling; Soil and Water Assessment Tool (SWAT); water balance,SWAT MODEL; RAINFALL; CFSR; SOIL; CALIBRATION; SIMULATION; HYDROLOGY; QUALITY,,MDPI,BASEL,"ST ALBAN-ANLAGE 66, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND",,2073-4441,,WATER-SUI,Water,JUN,2018,10,6,,,725,
671,Exploratory studies into seasonal flow forecasting potential for large lakes,"In seasonal flow forecasting applications, one factor which can help predictability is a significant hydrological response time between rainfall and flows. On account of storage influences, large lakes therefore provide a useful test case although, due to the spatial scales involved, there are a number of modelling challenges related to data availability and understanding the individual components in the water balance. Here some possible model structures are investigated using a range of stochastic regression and transfer function techniques with additional insights gained from simple analytical approximations. The methods were evaluated using records for two of the largest lakes in the world Lake Malawi and Lake Victoria - with forecast skill demonstrated several months ahead using water balance models formulated in terms of net inflows. In both cases slight improvements were obtained for lead times up to 4-5 months from including climate indices in the data assimilation component. The paper concludes with a discussion of the relevance of the results to operational flow forecasting systems for other large lakes.",https://doi.org/10.5194/hess-22-127-2018,10.5194/hess-22-127-2018,"Sene, Kevin; Tych, Wlodek; Beven, Keith",HYDROLOGY AND EARTH SYSTEM SCIENCES,,STREAMFLOW PREDICTION; SOUTHERN AFRICA; WATER-BALANCE; GREAT-LAKES; EAST-AFRICA; VICTORIA; RAINFALL; CLIMATE; MALAWI; SYSTEM,,COPERNICUS GESELLSCHAFT MBH,GOTTINGEN,"BAHNHOFSALLEE 1E, GOTTINGEN, 37081, GERMANY",1027-5606,1607-7938,,HYDROL EARTH SYST SC,Hydrol.

672,Combined deterministic - stochastic forecasting of monthly river flows for water management,"Monthly discharges can be modelled and predicted by the decomposition of the runoff process model into two components - deterministic and stochastic. For such approach the term hybrid was often adopted. In this study a hybrid (deterministic-stochastic) modelling approach for one step ahead forecasting of mean monthly discharges at the gauging stations Banska Bystrica and Brehy on the Hron River in Slovakia was developed. The aim was to join the conceptual monthly rainfall runoff model KVHK and several time series models of the forecasting error time series of the conceptual model into a hybrid framework. Since these rainfall-runoff model error series may exhibit nonstationarity and heteroscedasticity, beside traditional ARMA models, GARCH type nonlinear time series models were also considered.",https://doi.org/10.1088/1755-1315/92/1/012052,10.1088/1755-1315/92/1/012052,"Szolgayova, E.

673,Evaluating post-processing approaches for monthly and seasonal streamflow forecasts,"Streamflow forecasting is prone to substantial uncertainty due to errors in meteorological forecasts, hydrological model structure, and parameterization, as well as in the observed rainfall and streamflow data used to calibrate the models. Statistical streamflow post-processing is an important technique available to improve the probabilistic properties of the forecasts. This study evaluates post-processing approaches based on three transformations - logarithmic (Log), log-sinh (Log-Sinh), and Box-Cox with lambda = 0.2 (BC0.2) - and identifies the best-performing scheme for post-processing monthly and seasonal (3-months-ahead) streamflow forecasts, such as those produced by the Australian Bureau of Meteorology. Using the Bureau's operational dynamic streamflow forecasting system, we carry out comprehensive analysis of the three post-processing schemes across 300 Australian catchments with a wide range of hydro-climatic conditions. Forecast verification is assessed using reliability and sharpness metrics, as well as the Continuous Ranked Probability Skill Score (CRPSS). Results show that the uncorrected forecasts (i. e. without post-processing) are unreliable at half of the catchments. Post-processing of forecasts substantially improves reliability, with more than 90% of forecasts classified as reliable. In terms of sharpness, the BC0.2 scheme substantially outperforms the Log and Log-Sinh schemes. Overall, the BC0.2 scheme achieves reliable and sharper-than-climatology forecasts at a larger number of catchments than the Log and Log-Sinh schemes. The improvements in forecast reliability and sharpness achieved using the BC0.2 post-processing scheme will help water managers and users of the forecasting service make better-informed decisions in planning and management of water resources.",https://doi.org/10.5194/hess-22-6257-2018,10.5194/hess-22-6257-2018,"Woldemeskel, Fitsum; McInerney, David; Lerat, Julien; Thyer, Mark; Kavetski, Dmitri; Shin, Daehyok; Tuteja, Narendra; Kuczera, George",HYDROLOGY AND EARTH SYSTEM SCIENCES,,RAINFALL-RUNOFF MODELS; PROBABILISTIC FORECASTS; UNCERTAINTY ESTIMATION; PREDICTION; SYSTEM; ERRORS; SKILL; POSTPROCESSOR; PRECIPITATION; VERIFICATION,,COPERNICUS GESELLSCHAFT MBH,GOTTINGEN,"BAHNHOFSALLEE 1E, GOTTINGEN, 37081, GERMANY",1027-5606,1607-7938,,HYDROL EARTH SYST SC,Hydrol.

674,Effect of Human-Induced Land Disturbance on Subseasonal Predictability of Near-Surface Variables Using an Atmospheric General Circulation Model,"Irrigation can affect climate and weather patterns from regional to global scales through the alteration of surface water and energy balances. Here, we couple a land-surface model (LSM) that includes various human land-water management activities including irrigation with an atmospheric general circulation model (AGCM) to examine the impacts of irrigation-induced land disturbance on the subseasonal predictability of near-surface variables. Results indicate that the simulated global irrigation and groundwater withdrawals (circa 2000) are similar to 3600 and similar to 370 km(3)/year, respectively, which are in good agreement with previous estimates from country statistics and offline-LSMs. Subseasonal predictions for boreal summers during the 1986-1995 period suggest that the spread among ensemble simulations of air temperature can be substantially reduced by using realistic land initializations considering irrigation-induced changes in soil moisture. Additionally, it is found that the subseasonal forecast skill for near-surface temperature and sea level pressure significantly improves when human-induced land disturbance is accounted for in the AGCM. These results underscore the need to incorporate irrigation into weather forecast models, such as the global forecast system.",https://doi.org/10.3390/atmos10110725,10.3390/atmos10110725,"Yamada, Tomohito J.; Pokhrel, Yadu",ATMOSPHERE,irrigation; subseasonal forecast; AGCM; land surface model,COVER CHANGE; SUMMER PRECIPITATION; COUPLING EXPERIMENT; CLIMATE SYSTEM; SOIL-MOISTURE; IRRIGATION; IMPACT; WATER; REPRESENTATION; TEMPERATURE,,MDPI,BASEL,"ST ALBAN-ANLAGE 66, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND",,2073-4433,,ATMOSPHERE-BASEL,Atmosphere,NOV,2019,10,11,,,725,
675,Perspectives on flood forecast-based early action and opportunities for Earth observations,"This paper seeks to identify opportunities to integrate Earth observations (EO) into flood forecast-based early action and propose future directions for research and collaboration between EO and humanitarian communities. Forecast-based early action (FbA) is an approach to shift disaster response toward anticipation to mitigate impacts to at-risk communities; however, timely and accurate information is needed in the development of data-based triggers and thresholds for action. Therefore, this paper considers the readiness of a wide range of EO for flood monitoring and forecasting in the design, operations, and evaluation phases of FbA. The most significant opportunities for EO to inform FbA efforts lie in the design and evaluation phases, as EO can aid in the development of impact-based triggers. The EO products most readily applicable include precipitation, streamflow estimates, and exposure mapping, and those requiring the greatest amount of further research include vulnerability and impact assessments. This paper identifies collaboration opportunities for the EO and humanitarian communities to create tailored products, such as overlays combining flood extents with exposure maps. Such collaboration opportunities can be fostered by open data sharing, data verification efforts, and incentives for supporting boundary organizations capable of enabling the use of EO for FbA.

676,Epidemiological models for predicting Ross River virus in Australia: A systematic review,"Author summary As the most common human arbovirus infection in Australia, Ross River virus exerts a significant public health and economic burden on the population. Because the virus is transmitted by mosquitoes, incidence is influenced by climate, environment, and socio-economic factors. Using epidemiological models to predict incidence or outbreaks of RRV fully utilises these data to inform decision-making. In this systematic review, we summarised models and their predictive performance, and highlighted significant exposures in order to increase understanding of transmission. Ross River virus (RRV) is the most common and widespread arbovirus in Australia. Epidemiological models of RRV increase understanding of RRV transmission and help provide early warning of outbreaks to reduce incidence. However, RRV predictive models have not been systematically reviewed, analysed, and compared. The hypothesis of this systematic review was that summarising the epidemiological models applied to predict RRV disease and analysing model performance could elucidate drivers of RRV incidence and transmission patterns. We performed a systematic literature search in PubMed, EMBASE, Web of Science, Cochrane Library, and Scopus for studies of RRV using population-based data, incorporating at least one epidemiological model and analysing the association between exposures and RRV disease. Forty-three articles, all of high or medium quality, were included. Twenty-two (51.2%) used generalised linear models and 11 (25.6%) used time-series models. Climate and weather data were used in 27 (62.8%) and mosquito abundance or related data were used in 14 (32.6%) articles as model covariates. A total of 140 models were included across the articles. Rainfall (69 models, 49.3%), temperature (66, 47.1%) and tide height (45, 32.1%) were the three most commonly used exposures. Ten (23.3%) studies published data related to model performance. This review summarises current knowledge of RRV modelling and reveals a research gap in comparing predictive methods. To improve predictive accuracy, new methods for forecasting, such as non-linear mixed models and machine learning approaches, warrant investigation.",https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pntd.0008621,10.1371/journal.pntd.0008621,"Qian, Wei; Viennet, Elvina; Glass, Kathryn; Harley, David",PLOS NEGLECTED TROPICAL DISEASES,,MOSQUITO SPECIES DIPTERA; CLIMATE VARIABILITY; INFECTIOUS-DISEASE; ENVIRONMENTAL-FACTORS; TEMPORAL ANALYSIS; SOUTH-AUSTRALIA; MURRAY VALLEY; TRANSMISSION; QUEENSLAND; CULICIDAE,,PUBLIC LIBRARY SCIENCE,SAN FRANCISCO,"1160 BATTERY STREET, STE 100, SAN FRANCISCO, CA 94111 USA",1935-2735,,,PLOS NEGLECT TROP D,Plos Neglect.

677,"Assessing the new Natural Resources Conservation Service water supply forecast model for the American West: A challenging test of explainable, automated, ensemble artificial intelligence","Western US water management is underpinned by spring-summer water supply forecasts (WSFs) from hydrologic models forced primarily by winter mountain snowpack data. The US Department of Agriculture Natural Resources Conservation Service (NRCS) operates the largest such system regionally. NRCS recently developed a next-generation WSF prototype, the multi-model machine-learning metasystem (M-4). Here, we test this ensemble artificial intelligence (AI)-based prototype against challenging theoretical and practical criteria for accepting a new operational WSF model. In 20 hindcasting test-cases spanning diverse environments across the western US and Alaska, on average out-of-sample R-2 and RPSS improved over 50% and RMSE improved 13% relative to current benchmarks. The M-4 ensemble mean forecast also performed more consistently than any of its diverse constituent models and in several cases outperformed all of them. Live operational testing at a subset of sites during the 2020 forecast season additionally demonstrated logistical feasibility of workflows, as well as geophysical explainability of results in terms of known hydrologic processes, belying the black-box reputation of machine learning and enabling relatable forecast storylines for clients. This was accomplished using WSF-focused pragmatic solutions, like popular votes for different candidate predictors among the constituent forecast systems, and graphical visualization of reduced-dimension, AI-extracted nonlinear feature-target relationships. We also found that certain M-4 technical design elements, including autonomous machine learning (AutoML), hyperparameter pre-calibration, and theory-guided data science, collectively permitted automated (over-the-loop) training and operation. Overall, the analyses confirmed M-4 meets requirements for NRCS operational adoption. This finding signals that, despite negligible operational-community uptake of machine learning so far, suitably purpose-designed novel AI systems have capacity to transition into large-scale practical applications with service-delivery organizations; it appears M-4 will be the largest AI migration into operational river forecasting to date. It may ultimately provide a broader integration platform for harnessing multiple data and model types.",https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jhydrol.2021.126782,10.1016/j.jhydrol.2021.126782,"Fleming, Sean W.; Garen, David C.; Goodbody, Angus G.; McCarthy, Cara S.; Landers, Lexi C.",JOURNAL OF HYDROLOGY,Water supply forecasting; Operational hydrology; Explainable machine learning; Hydrologic modeling; Water management,HYDROLOGICAL FORECASTS; STREAMFLOW FORECASTS; NEURAL NETWORKS; CLIMATE; RIVER; RUNOFF; COLUMBIA; MACHINE; FUTURE; PREDICTORS,,ELSEVIER,AMSTERDAM,"RADARWEG 29, 1043 NX AMSTERDAM, NETHERLANDS",0022-1694,1879-2707,,J HYDROL,J.

678,Machine learning to predict biomass sorghum yields under future climate scenarios,"Crop yield modeling is critical in the design of national strategies for agricultural production, particularly in the context of a changing climate. Forecasting yields of bioenergy crops at fine spatial resolutions can help to evaluate near-term and long-term pathways for scaling up bio-based fuel and chemical production, and for understanding the impacts of abiotic stressors such as severe droughts and temperature extremes on potential biomass supply. We used a large dataset of 28,364 Sorghum bicolor yield samples (uniquely identified by county and year of observation), environmental variables, and multiple approaches to analyze historical trends in sorghum productivity across the USA. We selected the most accurate machine learning approach (a variation of the random forest approach) to predict future trends in sorghum yields under four greenhouse gas (GHG) emission scenarios and two irrigation regimes. We identified irrigation practices, vapor pressure deficit, and time (a proxy for technological improvement) as the most important predictors of sorghum productivity. Our results showed a decreasing trend of sorghum yields over future years (on average 2.7% from 2018 to 2099), with greater decline under a high GHG emissions scenario (3.8%) and in the absence of irrigation (4.6%). Geographically, we observed the steepest predicted declines in the Great Lakes (8.2%), Upper Midwest (7.5%), and Heartland (6.7%) regions. Our study demonstrates the use of machine learning to identify environmental controllers of sorghum biomass yield and predict yields with reasonable accuracy. These results can inform the development of more realistic biomass supply projections for bioenergy if sorghum production is scaled up.

Operational ice jam flood forecasting systems are becoming one of the more prominent tools used in mitigating ice-related flood risk within Canada. Several forecasting systems have been adopted across the country and forecasters are constantly looking to improve the accuracy and consistency of their systems. The Lower Red River in Manitoba has been the subject in discussion of many ice jam related studies, and a data-driven ice-jam hazard forecasting system is currently in use at this site. This system differs from hydrologic model driven forecasting systems used for other ice jam prone rivers across Canada. This study focuses on identifying the methodology of the data driven ice jam flood forecasting system, along with the methodology of the forecasting procedures. Furthermore, the effectiveness of the data driven forecasting system is measured and assessed for the Lower Red River's 2020 breakup season.",https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ijdrr.2020.102001,10.1016/j.ijdrr.2020.102001,"Williams, Brandon S.; Das, Apurba; Johnston, Peter; Luo, Bin; Lindenschmidt, Karl-Erich",INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF DISASTER RISK REDUCTION,Ice jam; Operational flood forecasting; Data-driven model; Stochastic modelling; Red river,MANAGEMENT; FREQUENCY; BREAKUP; CANADA,,ELSEVIER,AMSTERDAM,"RADARWEG 29, 1043 NX AMSTERDAM, NETHERLANDS",2212-4209,,,INT J DISAST RISK RE,Int.

680,The Performance Analysis of Robust Local Mean Mode Decomposition Method for Forecasting of Hydrological Time Series,"Accurate forecasting of streamflow data over daily timescales is a critical problem for the long-term management of water resources, agricultural uses, and many more purposes. This study proposes a new hybrid approach that combines the Robust Local Mean Decomposition (RLMD) method and the Artificial Neural Network (ANN) method for the prediction of streamflow data. Monthly streamflow data were split into the training and the testing part firstly and threefold cross-validation was performed to obtain a more reliable model. After building of the model using the training data, the proposed model was tested on the testing data. Also to compare the performance of the RLMD-ANN model and the Support Vector Regression (SVR) model, Long Short-Term Memory Networks (LSTM) were used for forecasting of subband signal and streamflow data. Also, the hybrid Empirical Mode Decomposition (EMD) model and hybrid Autoregressive Integrated Moving Average (ARIMA) model were used for comparison of the proposed model. Therefore, the RLMD-ANN model was compared with RLMD-SVR, RLMD-LSTM, EMD-ANN, Additive-ARIMA-ANN, ANN, SVR, and LSTM models. The numerical results of the study were assessed concerning the Mean Square Error (MSE), Mean Absolute Error (MAE), Determination Coefficient (R-2), Correlation Coefficient (R), and Kruskal-Wallis test was used to indicate whether the results are statically significant. One- to three-ahead forecast and one-two inputs were applied to the models. The mean one-ahead forecasting performance of the three folds was calculated for two inputs with MSE, MAE, R-2, and R parameters as 0.0060, 0.0522, 0.7342, and 0.8532 respectively.

681,Near-Real-Time Flood Forecasting Based on Satellite Precipitation Products,"Floods, storms and hurricanes are devastating for human life and agricultural cropland. Near-real-time (NRT) discharge estimation is crucial to avoid the damages from flood disasters. The key input for the discharge estimation is precipitation. Directly using the ground stations to measure precipitation is not efficient, especially during a severe rainstorm, because precipitation varies even in the same region. This uncertainty might result in much less robust flood discharge estimation and forecasting models. The use of satellite precipitation products (SPPs) provides a larger area of coverage of rainstorms and a higher frequency of precipitation data compared to using the ground stations. In this paper, based on SPPs, a new NRT flood forecasting approach is proposed to reduce the time of the emergency response to flood disasters to minimize disaster damage. The proposed method allows us to forecast floods using a discharge hydrograph and to use the results to map flood extent by introducing SPPs into the rainfall-runoff model. In this study, we first evaluated the capacity of SPPs to estimate flood discharge and their accuracy in flood extent mapping. Two high temporal resolution SPPs were compared, integrated multi-satellite retrievals for global precipitation measurement (IMERG) and tropical rainfall measurement mission multi-satellite precipitation analysis (TMPA). The two products are evaluated over the Ottawa watershed in Canada during the period from 10 April 2017 to 10 May 2017. With TMPA, the results showed that the difference between the observed and modeled discharges was significant with a Nash-Sutcliffe efficiency (NSE) of -0.9241 and an adapted NSE (ANSE) of -1.0048 under high flow conditions. The TMPA-based model did not reproduce the shape of the observed hydrographs. However, with IMERG, the difference between the observed and modeled discharges was improved with an NSE equal to 0.80387 and an ANSE of 0.82874. Also, the IMERG-based model could reproduce the shape of the observed hydrographs, mainly under high flow conditions. Since IMERG products provide better accuracy, they were used for flood extent mapping in this study. Flood mapping results showed that the error was mostly within one pixel compared with the observed flood benchmark data of the Ottawa River acquired by RadarSat-2 during the flood event. The newly developed flood forecasting approach based on SPPs offers a solution for flood disaster management for poorly or totally ungauged watersheds regarding precipitation measurement. These findings could be referred to by others for NRT flood forecasting research and applications.",https://doi.org/10.3390/rs11030252,10.3390/rs11030252,"Belabid, Nasreddine; Zhao, Feng; Brocca, Luca; Huang, Yanbo; Tan, Yumin",REMOTE SENSING,satellite precipitation products (SSPs); flood forecasting; discharge estimation; MILc model; integrated multi-satellite retrievals for global precipitation measurement (IMERG); tropical rainfall measurement mission multi-satellite precipitation analysis (TMPA); flood extent mapping,MODIS; MODEL,,MDPI,BASEL,"ST ALBAN-ANLAGE 66, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND",,2072-4292,,REMOTE SENS-BASEL,Remote Sens.,FEB 1,2019,11,3,,,252,
682,Long-term monthly streamflow forecasting in humid and semiarid regions,"Long-term monthly streamflow forecasting has great importance in the water resource system planning. However, its modelling in extreme cases is difficult, especially in semiarid regions. The main purpose of this paper is to evaluate the accuracy of artificial neural networks (ANNs) and hybrid wavelet-artificial neural networks (WA-ANNs) for multi-step monthly streamflow forecasting in two different hydro-climatic regions in Northern Algeria. Different issues have been addressed, both those related to the model's structure and those related to wavelet transform. The discrete wavelet transform has been used for the preprocessing of the input variables of the hybrid models, and the multi-step streamflow forecast was carried out by means of a recursive approach. The study demonstrated that WA-ANN models outperform the single ANN models for the two hydro-climatic regions. According to the performance criteria used, the results highlighted the ability of WA-ANN models with lagged streamflows, precipitations and evapotranspirations to forecast up to 19 months for the humid region with good accuracy [Nash-Sutcliffe criterion (N-s) equal 0.63], whereas, for the semiarid region, the introduction of evapotranspirations does not improve the model's accuracy for long lead time (N-s less than 0.6 for all combinations used). The maximum lead time achieved, for the semiarid region, was about 13 months, with only lagged streamflows as inputs.",https://doi.org/10.1007/s11600-019-00312-3,10.1007/s11600-019-00312-3,"Fouchal, Amel; Souag-Gamane, Doudja",ACTA GEOPHYSICA,Neural networks; Multi-step forecasting; Monthly streamflow; Wavelet transform; Hydro-climatic regions,ARTIFICIAL NEURAL-NETWORKS; WAVELET DECOMPOSITION; MODEL; ANN; PREDICTION; MULTISTEP; TRANSFORM,,SPRINGER INTERNATIONAL PUBLISHING AG,CHAM,"GEWERBESTRASSE 11, CHAM, CH-6330, SWITZERLAND",1895-6572,1895-7455,,ACTA GEOPHYS,Acta Geophys.,AUG,2019,67,4,1223,1240,,
683,Predictive modelling of the stage-discharge relationship using Gene-Expression Programming,"Modelling the hydrologic processes is an essential tool for the efficient management of water resource systems. Therefore, researchers are consistently developing and improving various predictive/forecasting techniques to accurately represent a river's attributes, even though traditional methods are available. This paper presents the Gene-Expression Programming (GEP) modelling technique to accurately model the stage-discharge relationship for the Arouca River in Trinidad and Tobago using only low flow data. The proposed method uses the stage and associated discharge measurements at one cross-section of the Arouca River. These measurements were used to train the GEP model. The results of the GEP model were also compared to the traditional method of the Stage-Discharge Rating Curve (SRC). Four statistical paraments namely the Pearson's Correlation Coefficient (R), Root Mean Square Error (RMSE), Mean Absolute Relative Error (MARE) and Nash-Sutcliffe efficiency (NSE) were used to evaluate the performance of the GEP model and the SRC method. Overall, the GEP model performed exceptionally well with an R-2 of 0.990, RMSE of 0.104, MARE of 0.076 and NSE of 0.957.",https://doi.org/10.2166/ws.2021.111,10.2166/ws.2021.111,"Birbal, Prashant; Azamathulla, Hazi; Leon, Lee; Kumar, Vikram; Hosein, Jerome",WATER SUPPLY,Gene-Expression Programming; low flows; modelling; stage-discharge,CURVE,,IWA PUBLISHING,LONDON,"REPUBLIC-EXPORT BLDG, UNITS 1 04 & 1 05, 1 CLOVE CRESCENT, LONDON, ENGLAND",1606-9749,1607-0798,,WATER SUPPLY,Water Supply,NOV,2021,21,7,3503,3514,,
684,Evaluation of two hydrometeorological ensemble strategies for flash-flood forecasting over a catchment of the eastern Pyrenees,"This study aims at evaluating the performances of flash-flood forecasts issued from deterministic and ensemble meteorological prognostic systems. The hydrometeorological modeling chain includes the Weather Research and Forecasting Model (WRF) forcing the rainfall-runoff model MARINE dedicated to flash floods. Two distinct ensemble prediction systems accounting for (i) perturbed initial and lateral boundary conditions of the meteorological state and (ii) mesoscale model physical parameterizations have been implemented on the Agly catchment of the eastern Pyrenees with three subcatchments exhibiting different rainfall regimes. Different evaluations of the performance of the hydrometeorological strategies have been performed: (i) verification of short-range ensemble prediction systems and corresponding streamflow forecasts, for a better understanding of how forecasts behave; (ii) usual measures derived from a contingency table approach, to test an alert threshold exceedance; and (iii) overall evaluation of the hydrometeorological chain using the continuous rank probability score, for a general quantification of the ensemble performances. Results show that the overall discharge forecast is improved by both ensemble strategies with respect to the deterministic forecast. Threshold exceedance detections for flood warning also benefit from large hydrometeorological ensemble spread. There are no substantial differences between both ensemble strategies on these test cases in terms of both the issuance of flood warnings and the overall performances, suggesting that both sources of external-scale uncertainty are important to take into account.",https://doi.org/10.5194/nhess-20-425-2020,10.5194/nhess-20-425-2020,"Roux, Helene; Amengual, Arnau; Romero, Romu; Blade, Ernest; Sanz-Ramos, Marcos",NATURAL HAZARDS AND EARTH SYSTEM SCIENCES,,HYDROLOGICAL MODEL; RAINFALL; PRECIPITATION; UNCERTAINTY; CONVECTION; PREDICTION; PERTURBATIONS; SIMULATIONS; ADVECTION; BEHAVIOR,,COPERNICUS GESELLSCHAFT MBH,GOTTINGEN,"BAHNHOFSALLEE 1E, GOTTINGEN, 37081, GERMANY",1561-8633,1684-9981,,NAT HAZARD EARTH SYS,Nat.

685,Prediction of monthly flows for Tres Marias reservoir (Sao Francisco river basin) using the CFS climate forecast model,"Despite the water crisis in 2016, 76% of the energy in Brazil was generated by hydroelectric plants, which shows that the Brazilian system is still strongly dependent on the hydrological conditions of basins. Therefore, the flow forecasts for these plants subsidize the decision making within the scope of the Electric Sector, since they allow the evaluation of the operational conditions of the hydroelectric and thermoelectric plants through the use of energy optimization models, providing gains in the operations of SIN (Sistema Interligado Nacional - the Brazilian National Interconnected System). The precipitation forecast is of fundamental importance for the elaboration of these hydroelectric flow forecasts. For energy evaluations, the DECOMP and NEWAVE models are used, with the GEVAZP model being applied to generate scenarios through an AR (p) (autoregressive) model. Accordingly, this study shows the impact of precipitation forecast on flow predictions in the climate horizon. For this, a statistical correction was made in the rain predicted by the CFS (Climate Forecast System) model, which tends to overestimate the predicted rain, with rainfall-flow models being calibrated. Tests were performed with this new modeling system and the results, in the form of scenarios, were compared with the scenarios generated by the GEVAZP model, showing the possibility of reducing the generated range by the latter, consequently causing the DECOMP model to not consider ranges with little or no probability of occurrence, which can improve the optimization of the SIN operation planning. This work also shows that the SMAP model exhibited better performance when compared to the Neural Networks model, in terms of the average flow range predicted in relation to the observed flow. There was a clear improvement in the flow predictions with the incorporation of the rain observed one month ahead in the simulations, mainly in the forecast of high flows. Finally, the climate indices had a good relationship with the flow and rain variables.",https://doi.org/10.1590/2318-0331.252020190067,10.1590/2318-0331.252020190067,"Gomes De Paiva, Luana Ferreira; Montenegro, Suzana Maria; Cataldi, Marcio",RBRH-REVISTA BRASILEIRA DE RECURSOS HIDRICOS,Flow forecast; Sao Francisco river; Neural Networks (NN); SMAP (Soil Moisture Accounting Procedure); Precipitation forecast; Hydrological simulation,,,ASSOC BRASILEIRA RECURSOS HIDRICOS-ABRH,PORTE ALEGRE,"AV BENTO GONCALVES 9500, PORTE ALEGRE, RS 91501-970, BRAZIL",1414-381X,2318-0331,,RBRH-REV BRAS RECUR,RBRH-Rev.

686,"Design and evaluation of SVR, MARS and M5Tree models for 1, 2 and 3-day lead time forecasting of river flow data in a semiarid mountainous catchment","Accurate and reliable river flow forecasts attained with data-intelligent models can provide significant information about future water resources management. In this study we employed a 50-model ensemble of three data-driven predictive models, namely the support vector regression (SVR), multivariate adaptive regression spline (MARS) and M5 model tree (M5Tree) to forecast river flow data in a semiarid and ecologically significant mountainous region of Pailugou catchment in northwestern China. To attain stable and accurate forecast results, 50 different models were trained by randomly sampling the entire river flow data into 80% for training and 20% for testing subsets. To attain a complete evaluation of the ensemble-model based results, the global mean of six quantitative statistical performance evaluation measures: the coefficient of correlation (R), mean absolute relative error (MAE), root mean squared error (RMSE), Nash-Sutcliffe efficiency coefficient (NS), relative RMSE, and the Willmott's Index (WI), and Taylor diagrams, including skill scores relative to a persistence model, were selected to assess the performances of the developed predictive models. The results indicated that all of the averaged R value attained was higher than 0.900 and all of the averaged NS values were higher than 0.800, representing good performance of the SVR, MARS and M5Tree models applied in the 1-, 2- and 3-day ahead modeling horizon, and this also accorded with the deductions made through an assessment of the Willmott's Index. However, the M5Tree model outperformed both the SVR and MARS models (with NS = 0.917 vs. 0.904 and 0.901 for 1-day, 0.893 vs. 0.854 and 0.845 for 2-day, and 0.850 vs. 0.828 and 0.810 for 3-day forecasting horizons, respectively), which was in concurrence with the high value of WI. Therefore, based on the ensemble of 50 models, the performance of the M5Tree can be considered as superior to the SVR and MARS models when applied in a problem of river flow forecasting at multiple forecast horizon. A detailed comparison of the overall performance of all three models evaluated through Taylor diagrams and boxplots indicated that the 1-day ahead forecasting results were more accurate for all of the predictive models compared to the 2- and 3-day ahead forecasting horizons. Data-intelligent models designed in this study indicate that the M5Tree method could successfully be explored for short-term river flow forecasting in semiarid mountainous regions, which may have useful implications in water resources management, ecological sustainability and assessment of river systems.",https://doi.org/10.1007/s00477-018-1585-2,10.1007/s00477-018-1585-2,"Yin, Zhenliang; Feng, Qi; Wen, Xiaohu; Deo, Ravinesh C.; Yang, Linshan; Si, Jianhua; He, Zhibin",STOCHASTIC ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH AND RISK ASSESSMENT,River flow forecasting; Support vector regression; Multivariate adaptive regression spline; M5Tree model; Data-driven model,SUPPORT VECTOR MACHINE; ADAPTIVE REGRESSION SPLINES; ARTIFICIAL NEURAL-NETWORK; RAINFALL-RUNOFF PROCESS; GLOBAL SOLAR-RADIATION; FUZZY INFERENCE SYSTEM; ABSOLUTE ERROR MAE; PAN EVAPORATION; REFERENCE EVAPOTRANSPIRATION; FREQUENCY-ANALYSIS,,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"ONE NEW YORK PLAZA, SUITE 4600, NEW YORK, NY, UNITED STATES",1436-3240,1436-3259,,STOCH ENV RES RISK A,Stoch.

687,A hybrid support vector regression framework for streamflow forecast,"Monthly streamflow time series are highly non-linear. How to improve forecast accuracy is a great challenge in hydrological studies. A lot of research has been conducted to address the streamflow forecasting problem, however, few methods are developed to make a systematic research. The objective of this study is to understand the underlying trend of streamflow so that a regression model can be developed to forecast the flow volume. In this paper, a hybrid streamflow forecast framework is proposed that integrates factor analysis, time series decomposition, data regression, and error suppression. Correlation coefficients between the current streamflow and the streamflow with lags are analyzed using autocorrelation function (ACF), partial autocorrelation function (PACE), and grey correlation analysis (GCA). Support vector regression (SVR) and generalized regression neural network (GRNN) models are integrated with seasonal and trend decomposition to make monthly streamflow forecast. Auto-regression and multi-model combination error correction methods are used to ensure the accuracy. In our experiments, the proposed method is compared with a stochastic autoregressive integrated moving average (ARIMA) streamflow forecast model. Fourteen models are developed, and the monthly streamflow data of Shigu and Xiangjiaba, China from 1961 to 2009 are used to evaluate our proposed method. Our results demonstrate that the integrated model of grey correlation analysis, Seasonal-Trend Decomposition Procedure Based on Loess (STL), Support Vector Regression (GCA-STL-SVR) exhibits an improved performance for monthly streamflow forecast. The average error of the proposed model is reduced to less than one-tenth in contrast to the state-of-the-art method and the standard deviation is also reduced by more than 30%, which implies a greater consistency.",https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jhydrol.2018.10.064,10.1016/j.jhydrol.2018.10.064,"Luo, Xiangang; Yuan, Xiaohui; Zhu, Shuang; Xu, Zhanya; Meng, Lingsheng; Peng, Jing",JOURNAL OF HYDROLOGY,Streamflow forecast; Regression; Factor analysis; Time series decomposition,WATER-RESOURCES APPLICATIONS; RAINFALL-RUNOFF MODELS; NEURAL-NETWORK MODELS; INPUT DETERMINATION; COMBINATION,,ELSEVIER,AMSTERDAM,"RADARWEG 29, 1043 NX AMSTERDAM, NETHERLANDS",0022-1694,1879-2707,,J HYDROL,J.

688,"Machine learning techniques for monthly river flow forecasting of Hunza River, Pakistan","The forecast of river flow has high great importance in water resources and hazard management. It becomes more important in mountain areas because most of the downstream populations have high dependency for their livelihood, agriculture, and commercial activities like hydro power production. In this context, in recent times, machine learning models have got high attention due to their high accuracy in forecasting through self-learning from physical processes. In this work, we consider the potential of a data driven methods of machine learning, namely multilayer perceptron (MLP), support vector regression (SVR), and random forest (RF), are explored to forecast Hunza river flow in Pakistan using in-situ dataset for the period from 1962 to 2008. A set of five input combinations with lagged river flow values are developed based on the autocorrelation (ACF) and partial autocorrelation function (PACF) on historical river flow data. A comparative investigation is conducted to assess the performance of MLP, SVR and RF. The results of machine learning models are compared using forecasting metrics defined as correlation coefficient (R), mean absolute error (MAE), root mean square error (RMSE), and mean square error (MSE) between the observed and forecasted river flow data to assess the models' effectiveness. The results show that RF performed the best followed by MLP and SVR. In measurable terms, superiority of RF over MPL and SVR models was demonstrated by R-2 = 0.993, 0.910, and 0.831, RMSE = 0.069, 0.084, and 0.104, MAE = 0.040, 0.058, and 0.062, respectively. The RF model performed 33.6% better than SVR and 17.85% to MLP.

689,A Simple Way to Increase the Prediction Accuracy of Hydrological Processes Using an Artificial Intelligence Model,"Rainfall and evaporation, which are known as two complex and unclear processes in hydrology, are among the key processes in the design and management of water resource projects. The application of artificial intelligence, in comparison with physical and empirical models, can be effective in the face of the complexity of hydrological processes. The present study was prepared with the aim of increasing the accuracy in monthly prediction of rainfall (R) and pan evaporation (EP) by providing a simple solution to determining new inputs for forecasting scenarios. Initially, the prediction of two parameters, R and EP, for the current and one-three lead times, by determining the different input modes, was developed with the SVM model. Then, in order to increase the accuracy of the predictions, the month number (tau) was added to all scenarios in predicting both the R and EP parameters. The results of the intelligent model using several statistical indices (i.e., root mean square error (RMSE), Kling-Gupta (KGE) and correlation coefficient (CC)), with the help of case visual indicators, were compared. The month number (tau) was able to greatly improve the prediction accuracy of both the R and EP parameters under the SVM model and overcome the complexities within these two hydrological processes that the scenarios were not initially able to solve with high accuracy. This is proven in all time steps. According to the RMSE, KGE and CC indices, the highest increase in the forecast accuracy for the upcoming two months of rainfall (Rt+2) for Ardabil station in scenario 2 (SVM-2) was 19.1, 858 and 125%, and for the current month of pan evaporation (EPt) for Urmia station in scenario 6 (SVM-6), this occurred at the rates of 40.2, 11.1 and 7.6%, respectively. Finally, in order to investigate the characteristic of the month number in the SVM model under special conditions such as considering the highest values of the R and EP time series, it was proved that by using the month number of the SVM model, again, the accuracy could be improved (on average, 17% improvement for rainfall, and 13% for pan evaporation) in almost all time steps. Due to the wide range of effects of the two variables studied in the hydrological discussion, the results of the present study can be useful in agricultural sciences and in water management in general and will help owners.",https://doi.org/10.3390/su13147752,10.3390/su13147752,"Meidute-Kavaliauskiene, Ieva; Jabehdar, Milad Alizadeh; Davidaviciene, Vida; Ghorbani, Mohammad Ali; Sammen, Saad Sh",SUSTAINABILITY,rainfall; prediction; pan evaporation; hydrology; artificial intelligence; month number,SUPPORT VECTOR MACHINES; NEURAL-NETWORKS; GROUNDWATER LEVELS; EVAPORATION; REGRESSION,,MDPI,BASEL,"ST ALBAN-ANLAGE 66, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND",,2071-1050,,SUSTAINABILITY-BASEL,Sustainability,JUL,2021,13,14,,,7752,
690,Sustainable and reliable design of reverse osmosis desalination with hybrid renewable energy systems through supply chain forecasting using recurrent neural networks,"Renewable energy systems coupled with reverse osmosis (RO) desalination represent a great contribution to the fields of energy and sustainability. Especially in remote areas, where reliability issues associated with integrated systems result in problems of insufficient power supply or supply loss due to the intermittency of renewable sources and varying freshwater demand. This research aims to design a sustainable and reliable hybrid renewable energy system (HRES) coupled with RO desalination system (HRES-RO), considering different operational scenarios with fluctuating renewable energy supply, and changeable water.demand. First, future energy supply from renewable sources, and water demand were forecasted to deal with the stochastic behavior of several variables including freshwater demand, ambient temperature, solar radiation, and wind speed by means of recurrent neural networks (RNN). Then, multi-criteria optimization was conducted using extended mathematical programming (EMP) with the aim of minimizing the total annual costs and greenhouse gas emission. Finally, the potential loss of power supply probability (PLPSP) was introduced as a tool to illustrate the sustainability of the proposed scenarios. The results showed that the proposed framework resulted in an HRES with optimized installation strategy using 111 photovoltaic panels and 5 wind turbines by considering three criteria (economic cost, environmental effect, and energy reliability). The designed system reduced PLPSP by 18.3% compared with the base case. Furthermore, the results demonstrated the contribution of advanced forecasting algorithms to address future uncertainties in the energy supply chain. (C) 2019 Elsevier Ltd.

691,Monthly reservoir inflow forecasting using a new hybrid SARIMA genetic programming approach,"Forecasting reservoir inflow is one of the most important components of water resources and hydroelectric systems operation management. Seasonal autoregressive integrated moving average (SARIMA) models have been frequently used for predicting river flow. SARIMA models are linear and do not consider the random component of statistical data. To overcome this shortcoming, monthly inflow is predicted in this study based on a combination of seasonal autoregressive integrated moving average (SARIMA) and gene expression programming (GEP) models, which is a new hybrid method (SARIMA-GEP). To this end, a four-step process is employed. First, the monthly inflow datasets are pre-processed. Second, the datasets are modelled linearly with SARIMA and in the third stage, the non-linearity of residual series caused by linear modelling is evaluated. After confirming the non-linearity, the residuals are modelled in the fourth step using a gene expression programming (GEP) method. The proposed hybrid model is employed to predict the monthly inflow to the Jamishan Dam in west Iran. Thirty years' worth of site measurements of monthly reservoir dam inflow with extreme seasonal variations are used. The results of this hybrid model (SARIMA-GEP) are compared with SARIMA, GEP, artificial neural network (ANN) and SARIMA-ANN models. The results indicate that the SARIMA-GEP model (R-2=78.8, VAF=78.8, RMSE=0.89, MAPE=43.4, CRM=0.053) outperforms SARIMA and GEP and SARIMA-ANN (R-2=68.3, VAF=66.4, RMSE=1.12, MAPE=56.6, CRM=0.032) displays better performance than the SARIMA and ANN models. A comparison of the two hybrid models indicates the superiority of SARIMA-GEP over the SARIMA-ANN model.",https://doi.org/10.1007/s12040-017-0798-y,10.1007/s12040-017-0798-y,"Moeeni, Hamid; Bonakdari, Hossein; Ebtehaj, Isa",JOURNAL OF EARTH SYSTEM SCIENCE,Forecasting; inflow; time series; hybrid; gene expression programming,ADAPTIVE NEURO-FUZZY; RIVER FLOW; TIME-SERIES; DISCHARGE COEFFICIENT; INFERENCE SYSTEM; ARIMA-ANN; NETWORK; MODELS,,INDIAN ACAD SCIENCES,BANGALORE,"C V RAMAN AVENUE, SADASHIVANAGAR, P B #8005, BANGALORE 560 080, INDIA",2347-4327,0973-774X,,J EARTH SYST SCI,J.

692,Identifying Key Hydrological Processes in Highly Urbanized Watersheds for Flood Forecasting with a Distributed Hydrological Model,"The world has experienced large-scale urbanization in the past century, and this trend is ongoing. Urbanization not only causes land use/cover (LUC) changes but also changes the flood responses of watersheds. Lumped conceptual hydrological models cannot be effectively used for flood forecasting in watersheds that lack long time series of hydrological data to calibrate model parameters. Thus, physically based distributed hydrological models are used instead in these areas, but considerable uncertainty is associated with model parameter derivation. To reduce model parameter uncertainty in physically based distributed hydrological models for flood forecasting in highly urbanized watersheds, a procedure is proposed to control parameter uncertainty. The core concept of this procedure is to identify the key hydrological and flood processes in the highly urbanized watersheds and the sensitive model parameters related to these processes. Then, the sensitive model parameters are adjusted based on local runoff coefficients to reduce the parameter uncertainty. This procedure includes these steps: collecting the latest LUC information or estimating this information using satellite remote sensing images, analyzing LUC spatial patterns and identifying dominant LUC types and their spatial structures, choosing and establishing a distributed hydrological model as the forecasting tool, and determining the initial model parameters and identifying the key hydrological processes and sensitive model parameters based on a parameter sensitivity analysis. A highly urbanized watershed called Shahe Creek in the Pearl River Delta area was selected as a case study. This study finds that the runoff production processes associated with both the ferric luvisol and acric ferralsol soil types and the runoff routing process on urban land are key hydrological processes. Additionally, the soil water content under saturated conditions, the soil water content under field conditions and the roughness of urban land are sensitive parameters.",https://doi.org/10.3390/w11081641,10.3390/w11081641,"Wang, Huanyu; Chen, Yangbo",WATER,flood forecasting; urbanization; distributed hydrological model; land use; cover; satellite remote sensing,COVER CHANGE; LAND-USE; CLASSIFICATION; SURFACE; SYSTEM; CALIBRATION; SATELLITE; NETWORKS; EUROPEEN; CLIMATE,,MDPI,BASEL,"ST ALBAN-ANLAGE 66, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND",,2073-4441,,WATER-SUI,Water,AUG,2019,11,8,,,1641,
693,Streamflow and Hydrological Drought Trend Analysis and Forecasting in Cyprus,"The persistent water shortage in Cyprus has been alleviated by importing freshwater from neighbouring countries, and severe droughts have been met with financial reimbursement from the EU at least twice. The goal of this research is to investigate and perform short-term forecasting of both streamflow and hydrological drought trends over the island. Eleven hydrometric stations with a 34-year common record length of the mean daily discharge from 10/1979 to 09/2013 are used for this purpose, with the relevant upstream catchments considered to represent pristine conditions. The Streamflow Drought Index (SDI) successfully captures the hydrological drought conditions over the island, and the performance of the index is validated based on both the historic drought archives and results from other drought indices for the island. The Mann-Kendall (M-K) test reveals that the annual and seasonal time series of the discharge volumes always illustrate a decreasing but insignificant trend at a significance level of a = 0.05; additionally, the decrease per decade in the average annual streamflow volume based on Sen's slope statistic is approximately -9.4%. The M-K test on the SDI reveals that drought conditions intensified with time. Ten autoregressive integrated moving average (ARIMA) models are built and used to forecast the mean monthly streamflow values with moderate accuracy; the best ARIMA forecast model in each catchment is derived by comparing two model-performance statistical measures for the different (p,d,q) model parameters.

694,A Multi-Step Approach Framework for Freight Forecasting of River-Sea Direct Transport without Direct Historical Data,"The freight forecasting of river-sea direct transport (RSDT) is crucial for the policy making of river-sea transportation facilities and the decision-making of relevant port and shipping companies. This paper develops a multi-step approach framework for freight volume forecasting of RSDT in the case that direct historical data are not available. First, we collect publicly available shipping data, including ship traffic flow, speed limit of each navigation channel, free-flow running time, channel length, channel capacity, etc. The origin-destination (O-D) matrix estimation method is then used to obtain the matrix of historical freight volumes among all O-D pairs based on these data. Next, the future total freight volumes among these O-D pairs are forecasted by using the gray prediction model, and the sharing rate of RSDT is estimated by using the logit model. The freight volume of RSDT is thus determined. The effectiveness of the proposed approach is validated by forecasting the RSDT freight volume on a shipping route of China.",https://doi.org/10.3390/su11154252,10.3390/su11154252,"Guo, Zhaoxia; Le, Weiwei; Wu, Youkai; Wang, Wei",SUSTAINABILITY,river-sea direct transportation; O-D matrix estimation; logit model; gray prediction model,CONTAINER THROUGHPUT; DEMAND; TIME,,MDPI,BASEL,"ST ALBAN-ANLAGE 66, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND",,2071-1050,,SUSTAINABILITY-BASEL,Sustainability,AUG,2019,11,15,,,4252,
695,A Composite Uncertainty Forecasting Model for Unstable Time Series: Application of Wind Speed and Streamflow Forecasting,"Wind speed and streamflow series always are nonlinear and unstable because the effects of chaotic weather systems. These inherent features make them difficult to forecast, especially in a changing environment. To improve forecasting accuracy, an innovation uncertainty forecasting architecture is developed by coupling data decomposition method, feature selection, multiple artificial intelligence (AI) techniques and composite strategy to do unstable time series forecasting. In the designed architecture, the AVMD (adaptive variational mode decomposition) is first applied to excavate implicit information from the original time series. Then, the random forest is utilized to select the suitable inputs for each mode. After that, the GPR (Gaussian Process Regression), a very famous probabilistic AI technique, is driven by various neural networks (ELM (Extreme Learning Machine), BP (Back Propagation Neural Networks), GRNN(Generalized Regression Neural Networks) and RBF (Radial Basis Function Neural Networks)) to produce both deterministic and probabilistic forecasting results in a nonlinear manner to play strengths of each other. The effectiveness and applicability of the proposed approach is verified by unstable wind speed data and streamflow data, and also compared with eleven related models. Results indicate that the proposed model not only improves the forecasting accuracy for deterministic predictions, but also provides more probabilistic information for decision making. The proposed method achieves significantly better performance than the traditional forecasting models both on wind speed forecasting and streamflow forecasting with at least 50% average performance promotion over all the eleven competitors. Comprehensive comparisons demonstrate the superior performance of the proposed method than the involved models as a powerful tool for unstable series forecasting.",https://doi.org/10.1109/ACCESS.2020.3034127,10.1109/ACCESS.2020.3034127,"Sun, Na; Zhang, Shuai; Peng, Tian; Zhou, Jianzhong; Sun, Xinguo",IEEE ACCESS,Forecasting; Predictive models; Wind speed; Data models; Computational modeling; Uncertainty; Unstable time series prediction; hybrid model; GPR; artificial intelligence; combination forecasting,NEURAL-NETWORK; SECONDARY DECOMPOSITION; PREDICTION INTERVAL; HYBRID MODEL; MACHINE; OPTIMIZATION; MULTISTEP,,IEEE-INST ELECTRICAL ELECTRONICS ENGINEERS INC,PISCATAWAY,"445 HOES LANE, PISCATAWAY, NJ 08855-4141 USA",2169-3536,,,IEEE ACCESS,IEEE Access,,2020,8,,209251,209266,,
696,Towards Safer Data-Driven Forecasting of Extreme Streamflows,"Predicting extreme events is one of the major goals of streamflow forecasting, but models that are reliable under such conditions are hard to come by. This stems in part from the fact that, in many cases, calibration is based on recorded time series that do not comprise extreme events. The problem is particularly relevant in the case of data-driven models, which are focused in this work. Based on synthetic and real world streamflow forecasting examples, two main research questions are addressed: 1) would/should the models chosen by established practice be maintained were extreme events being considered and 2) how can established practice be improved in order to reduce the risks associated with the poor forecasting of extreme events? Among the data-driven models employed in streamflow forecasting, Support Vector Regression (SVR) has earned the researchers' interest due to its good comparative performance. The present contribution builds upon the theory underlying this model in order to illustrate and discuss its tendency to predictably underestimate extreme flood peaks, raising awareness to the obvious risks that entails. While focusing on SVR, the work highlights dangers potentially present in other non-linear regularized models. The results clearly show that, under certain conditions, established practices for validation and choice may fail to identify the best models for predicting extreme streamflow events. Also, the paper puts forward practical recommendations that may help avoiding potential problems, namely: establishing up to what return period does the model maintain good performances; privileging small lambda hyperparameters in Radial Basis Function (RBF) SVR models; preferring linear models when their validation performances are similar to those of non-linear models; and making use of predictions made by more than one type of data-driven model.",https://doi.org/10.1007/s11269-017-1834-z,10.1007/s11269-017-1834-z,"Matos, Jos P.; Portela, Maria M.; Schleiss, Anton J.",WATER RESOURCES MANAGEMENT,Artificial neural networks; Discharge; Extreme events; Forecasting; Support vector regression,SUPPORT VECTOR MACHINE; ARTIFICIAL NEURAL-NETWORK; RIVER FLOW; UNCERTAINTY; PREDICTION; MODELS; PRECIPITATION; REGRESSION; INFLOW; SYSTEM,,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0920-4741,1573-1650,,WATER RESOUR MANAG,Water Resour.

697,Skillful Subseasonal Prediction of US Extreme Warm Days and Standardized Precipitation Index in Boreal Summer,"Skillful subseasonal prediction of extreme heat and precipitation greatly benefits multiple sectors, including water management, public health, and agriculture, in mitigating the impact of extreme events. A statistical model is developed to predict the weekly frequency of extreme warm days and 14-day standardized precipitation index (SPI) during boreal summer in the United States. We use a leading principal component of U.S. soil moisture and an index based on the North Pacific sea surface temperature (SST) as predictors. The model outperforms the NCEP Climate Forecast System, version 2 (CFSv2), at weeks 3-4 in the eastern United States. It is found that the North Pacific SST anomalies persist for several weeks and are associated with a persistent wave train pattern, which leads to increased occurrences of blocking and extreme temperature over the eastern United States. Extreme dry soil moisture conditions persist into week 4 and are associated with an increase in sensible heat flux and a decrease in latent heat flux, which may help to maintain the overlying anticyclone. The clear-sky conditions associated with blocking anticyclones further decrease soil moisture and increase the frequency of extreme warm days. This skillful statistical model has the potential to aid in irrigation scheduling, crop planning, and reservoir operation and to provide mitigation of impacts from extreme heat events.",https://doi.org/10.1175/JCLI-D-20-0878.1,10.1175/JCLI-D-20-0878.1,"Miller, Douglas E.; Wang, Zhuo; Li, Bo; Harnos, Daniel S.; Ford, Trent",JOURNAL OF CLIMATE,Atmosphere-land interaction; Atmosphere-ocean interaction; Blocking; Extreme events; Climate variability; Soil moisture; Statistical forecasting,SOIL-MOISTURE; UNITED-STATES; HEAT WAVES; CIRCUMGLOBAL TELECONNECTION; HOT DAYS; TEMPERATURE; IMPACT; FORECAST; PREDICTABILITY; VARIABILITY,,AMER METEOROLOGICAL SOC,BOSTON,"45 BEACON ST, BOSTON, MA 02108-3693 USA",0894-8755,1520-0442,,J CLIMATE,J.

698,Prediction of flood using optimized neural network with Gray wolf algorithm (Maroon River case study),"Floods, as one of the most frequent natural hazards, cause irreparable damage to infrastructure and agriculture, and housing every year. In order to avoid financial and human losses, the importance of flood forecasting seems inevitable. Considering that floods are caused by many natural and anthropogenic factors and also have limitations such as lack of complete information. In this study, artificial neural networks have been used as an efficient method for flood prediction. The neural network inputs include the Dubai River and the Eshel River, this data was collected over 8 Years from the Maroon River. The network used is a multilayer perceptron, also the neural network weights are optimized by the Gray wolf algorithm and the results are compared with other common methods. Analysis of the output results shows that the neural network with the Gray Wolf algorithm has better results than neural network and Genetic algorithms and the error of this method is 0.53%, which indicates high accuracy and precision for flood prediction compared to other evolutionary algorithms. This method is used to obtain the best amount of data for testing and training. As the results, the best rate is 80% for training and 20% for testing. Obtained results show the neural network error squares with 80% of the training data and 20% of the test data.",https://doi.org/10.15551/pesd2021152004,10.15551/pesd2021152004,"Doumari, Sajjad Amiri",PRESENT ENVIRONMENT AND SUSTAINABLE DEVELOPMENT,Flood Routing; Artificial Neural Network; Gray Wolf Algorithm; Maroon River,ACCURATE PREDICTION; MODEL,,"ALEXANDRU IOAN CUZA UNIV PRESS, FAC GEOGRAPHY & GEOLOGY",IASI,"STR PINILUI NR 1A, IASI, ROMANIA",1843-5971,2284-7820,,PRESENT ENV SUST DEV,Present Environ.

699,DEVELOPMENT OF RAINFALL FORECASTING MODEL USING MACHINE LEARNING WITH SINGULAR SPECTRUM ANALYSIS,"Agriculture is the key point for survival for developing nations like India. For farming, rainfall is generally significant. Rainfall updates are help for evaluate water assets, farming, ecosystems and hydrology. Nowadays rainfall anticipation has become a foremost issue. Forecast of rainfall offers attention to individuals and knows in advance about rainfall to avoid potential risk to shield their crop yields from severe rainfall. This study intends to investigate the dependability of integrating a data pre-processing technique called singular-spectrum-analysis (SSA) with supervised learning models called least-squares support vector regression (LS-SVR), and Random-Forest (RF), for rainfall prediction. Integrating SSA with LS-SVR and RF, the combined framework is designed and contrasted with the customary approaches (LS-SVR and RF). The presented frameworks were trained and tested utilizing a monthly climate dataset which is separated into 80:20 ratios for training and testing respectively. Performance of the model was assessed using Root Mean Square Error (RMSE) and Nash-Sutcliffe Efficiency (NSE) and the proposed model produces the values as 71.6 %, 90.2 % respectively.

700,Seasonal forecasting of hydrological drought in the Limpopo Basin: a comparison of statistical methods,"The Limpopo Basin in southern Africa is prone to droughts which affect the livelihood of millions of people in South Africa, Botswana, Zimbabwe and Mozambique. Seasonal drought early warning is thus vital for the whole region. In this study, the predictability of hydrological droughts during the main runoff period from December to May is assessed using statistical approaches. Three methods (multiple linear models, artificial neural networks, random forest regression trees) are compared in terms of their ability to forecast streamflow with up to 12 months of lead time. The following four main findings result from the study. 1. There are stations in the basin at which standardised streamflow is predictable with lead times up to 12 months. The results show high inter-station differences of forecast skill but reach a coefficient of determination as high as 0.73 (cross validated). 2. A large range of potential predictors is considered in this study, comprising well-established climate indices, customised teleconnection indices derived from sea surface temperatures and antecedent streamflow as a proxy of catchment conditions. El Nino and customised indices, representing sea surface temperature in the Atlantic and Indian oceans, prove to be important teleconnection predictors for the region. Antecedent streamflow is a strong predictor in small catchments (with median 42% explained variance), whereas teleconnections exert a stronger influence in large catchments. 3. Multiple linear models show the best forecast skill in this study and the greatest robustness compared to artificial neural networks and random forest regression trees, despite their capabilities to represent nonlinear relationships. 4. Employed in early warning, the models can be used to forecast a specific drought level. Even if the coefficient of determination is low, the forecast models have a skill better than a climatological forecast, which is shown by analysis of receiver operating characteristics (ROCs). Seasonal statistical forecasts in the Limpopo show promising results, and thus it is recommended to employ them as complementary to existing forecasts in order to strengthen preparedness for droughts.",https://doi.org/10.5194/hess-21-1611-2017,10.5194/hess-21-1611-2017,"Seibert, Mathias; Merz, Bruno; Apel, Heiko",HYDROLOGY AND EARTH SYSTEM SCIENCES,,SOUTHERN AFRICA; NEURAL-NETWORK; RIVER-BASIN; PREDICTABILITY; VARIABILITY; PREDICTION; RAINFALL; CLIMATE; PRECIPITATION; PERFORMANCE,,COPERNICUS GESELLSCHAFT MBH,GOTTINGEN,"BAHNHOFSALLEE 1E, GOTTINGEN, 37081, GERMANY",1027-5606,1607-7938,,HYDROL EARTH SYST SC,Hydrol.

701,Sensitivity of the weather research and forecasting model to parameterization schemes for regional climate of Nile River Basin,"Regional climate models (RCMs) have been used to simulate rainfall at relatively high spatial and temporal resolutions useful for sustainable water resources planning, design and management. In this study, the sensitivity of the RCM, weather research and forecasting (WRF), in modeling the regional climate of the Nile River Basin (NRB) was investigated using 31 combinations of different physical parameterization schemes which include cumulus (Cu), microphysics (MP), planetary boundary layer (PBL), land-surface model (LSM) and radiation (Ra) schemes. Using the European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecast (ECMWF) ERA-Interim reanalysis data as initial and lateral boundary conditions, WRF was configured to model the climate of NRB at a resolution of 36 km with 30 vertical levels. The 1999-2001 simulations using WRF were compared with satellite data combined with ground observation and the NCEP reanalysis data for 2 m surface air temperature (T2), rainfall, short- and longwave downward radiation at the surface (SWRAD, LWRAD). Overall, WRF simulated more accurate T2 and LWRAD (with correlation coefficients > 0.8 and low root-mean-square error) than SWRAD and rainfall for the NRB. Further, the simulation of rainfall is more sensitive to PBL, Cu and MP schemes than other schemes of WRF. For example, WRF simulated less biased rainfall with Kain-Fritsch combined with MYJ than with YSU as the PBL scheme. The simulation of T2 is more sensitive to LSM and Ra than to Cu, PBL and MP schemes selected, SWRAD is more sensitive to MP and Ra than to Cu, LSM and PBL schemes, and LWRAD is more sensitive to LSM, Ra and PBL than Cu, and MP schemes. In summary, the following combination of schemes simulated the most representative regional climate of NRB: WSM3 microphysics, KF cumulus, MYJ PBL, RRTM longwave radiation and Dudhia shortwave radiation schemes, and Noah LSM. The above configuration of WRF coupled to the Noah LSM has also been shown to simulate representative regional climate of NRB over 1980-2001 which include a combination of wet and dry years of the NRB.",https://doi.org/10.1007/s00382-017-3870-z,10.1007/s00382-017-3870-z,"Tariku, Tebikachew Betru; Gan, Thian Yew",CLIMATE DYNAMICS,WRF; Configuration of regional climate model; Temperature; Rainfall; Short and longwave radiation of Nile River Basin,DENSITY GAUGE DATASET; HEAVY RAINFALL EVENT; EASTERN AFRICA; BULK PARAMETERIZATION; CLOUD MICROPHYSICS; WEST-AFRICA; VALIDATION; VARIABILITY; TRMM; PRECIPITATION,,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"ONE NEW YORK PLAZA, SUITE 4600, NEW YORK, NY, UNITED STATES",0930-7575,1432-0894,,CLIM DYNAM,Clim.

702,Performance enhancement of SVM model using discrete wavelet transform for daily streamflow forecasting,"Streamflow modeling becomes a vital task in any hydrological study for an improved planning and management of water resources. Soft computing and machine learning techniques are becoming popular day by day for their predictive capability when limited input data are available. In the present study, Support Vector Machine (SVM) technique is applied to forecast 1-day, 3-day, and 5-day ahead streamflow using daily streamflow time-series of Khanapur, Cholachguda, and Navalgund gauging stations in Malaprabha sub-basin located in the Karnataka state of India. Furthermore, Discrete Wavelet Transform is used as a data pre-processing method to evaluate the performance enhancement of SVM model, for which four different mother wavelet functions are used and tested separately, namely, Haar, Daubechies, Coiflets, and Symlets. Models are evaluated using coefficient of determination (R-2), root-mean-square error, and Nash-Sutcliffe efficiency. The study indicates that the performance of SVM model improves considerably when wavelet method is coupled. It is found that the R-2 values for Khanapur station using SVM are 0.91, 0.66, and 0.46 for 1-day, 3-day, and 5-day lead-time forecasts, respectively. However, when wavelet method is coupled with SVM model, the R-2 is improved to 0.99, 0.73, and 0.68 for 1-day, 3-day, and 5-day lead-time forecasts, respectively.",https://doi.org/10.1007/s12665-021-09394-z,10.1007/s12665-021-09394-z,"Kambalimath, Shruti S.; Deka, Paresh Chandra",ENVIRONMENTAL EARTH SCIENCES,Soft computing; Streamflow forecasting; Data pre-processing; Support vector machine (SVM); Discrete wavelet transform (DWT),,,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"ONE NEW YORK PLAZA, SUITE 4600, NEW YORK, NY, UNITED STATES",1866-6280,1866-6299,,ENVIRON EARTH SCI,Environ.

703,Random forest classification to determine environmental drivers and forecast paralytic shellfish toxins in Southeast Alaska with high temporal resolution,"Paralytic shellfish poison toxins (PSTs) produced by the dinoflagellate in the genus Alexandrium are a threat to human health and subsistence lifestyles in Southeast Alaska. It is important to understand the drivers of Alex-andrium blooms to inform shellfish management and aquaculture, as well as to predict trends of PST in a changing climate. In this study, we aggregate environmental data sets from multiple agencies and tribal partners to model and predict concentrations of PSTs in Southeast Alaska from 2016 to 2019. We used daily PST concentrations interpolated from regularly sampled blue mussels (Mytilus trossulus) analyzed for total PSTs using a receptor binding assay. We then created random forest models to classify shellfish above and below a threshold of toxicity (80 mu g 100 g(-1)) and used two methods to determine variable importance. We obtained a multivariate model with key variables being sea surface temperature, salinity, freshwater discharge, and air temperature. We then used a similar model trained using lagged environmental variables to hindcast out-of-sample (OOS) shellfish toxicities during April-October in 2017, 2018, and 2019. Hindcast OOS accuracies were low (37-50%); however, we found forecasting using environmental variables may be useful in predicting the timing of early summer blooms. This study reinforces the efficacy of machine learning to determine important drivers of harmful algal blooms, although more complex models incorporating other parameters such as toxicokinetics are likely needed for accurate regional forecasts.",https://doi.org/10.1016/j.hal.2020.101918,10.1016/j.hal.2020.101918,"Harley, John R. y; Lanphier, Kari; Kennedy, Esther; Whitehead, Chris; Bidlack, Allison",HARMFUL ALGAE,HABs; Paralytic shellfish toxins; PSP; Alaska; Blue mussels; Machine learning,RECEPTOR-BINDING ASSAY; ALEXANDRIUM-CATENELLA; PUGET-SOUND; MARINE ECOSYSTEMS; ALGAL BLOOMS; DINOPHYCEAE; TEMPERATURE; PATTERNS; CYSTS; THAU,,ELSEVIER,AMSTERDAM,"RADARWEG 29, 1043 NX AMSTERDAM, NETHERLANDS",1568-9883,1878-1470,,HARMFUL ALGAE,Harmful Algae,NOV,2020,99,,,,101918,
704,Simulating the meteorology and PM10 concentrations in Arizona dust storms using the Weather Research and Forecasting model with Chemistry (Wrf-Chem),"Nine dust storms in south-central Arizona were simulated with the Weather Research and Forecasting with Chemistry model (WRF-Chem) at 2 km resolution. The windblown dust emission algorithm was the Air Force Weather Agency model. In comparison with ground-based PM10 observations, the model unevenly reproduces the dust-storm events. The model adequately estimates the location and timing of the events, but it is unable to precisely replicate the magnitude and timing of the elevated hourly concentrations of particles 10 mu m and smaller ([PM10]).Furthermore, the model underestimated [PM10] in highly agricultural Pinal County because it underestimated surface wind speeds and because the model's erodible fractions of the land surface data were too coarse to effectively resolve the active and abandoned agricultural lands. In contrast, the model overestimated [PM10] in western Arizona along the Colorado River because it generated daytime sea breezes (from the nearby Gulf of California) for which the surface-layer speeds were too strong. In Phoenix, AZ, the model's performance depended on the event, with both under- and overestimations partly due to incorrect representation of urban features. Sensitivity tests indicate that [PM10] highly relies on meteorological forcing. Increasing the fraction of erodible surfaces in the Pinal County agricultural areas improved the simulation of [PM10] in that region. Both 24-hr and 1-hr measured [PM10] were, for the most part, and especially in Pinal County, extremely elevated, with the former exceeding the health standard by as much as 10-fold and the latter exceeding health-based guidelines by as much as 70-fold. Monsoonal thunderstorms not only produce elevated [PM10], but also cause urban flash floods and disrupt water resource deliveries. Given the severity and frequency of these dust storms, and conceding that the modeling system applied in this work did not produce the desired agreement between simulations and observations, additional research in both the windblown dust emissions model and the weather research/physicochemical model is called for.Implications: While many dust storms can be considered to be natural, in semi-arid climates such storms often have an anthropogenic component in their sources of dust. Applying the natural, exceptional events policy to these storms with strong signatures of anthropogenic sources would appear not only to be misguided but also to stifle genuine regulatory efforts at remediation. Those dust storms that have resulted, in part, from passage over abandoned farm land should no longer be considered natural; policymakers and lawmakers need to compel the owners of such land to reduce its potential for windblown dust.",https://doi.org/10.1080/10962247.2017.1357662,10.1080/10962247.2017.1357662,"Hyde, Peter; Mahalov, Alex; Li, Jialun",JOURNAL OF THE AIR & WASTE MANAGEMENT ASSOCIATION,,UNITED-STATES; MINERAL DUST; PRECIPITATION; IMPACT; PARAMETERIZATION; SYSTEM; VALLEY,,TAYLOR & FRANCIS INC,PHILADELPHIA,"530 WALNUT STREET, STE 850, PHILADELPHIA, PA 19106 USA",1096-2247,2162-2906,,J AIR WASTE MANAGE,J.

705,The application of ensemble precipitation forecasts to reservoir operation,"Although inflow forecasts are useful information that can be used for improving reservoir operation efficiency, uncertainty is still a challenge for getting sound operation results. Ensemble precipitation forecasts can take uncertainties under consideration, so they have been a research topic for improving reservoir operations. In this paper, a rainfall-runoff model, combined of a multiple linear regression model (for non-flood seasons) and the Xinanjiang model (for flood seasons), for inflow forecasts and a stochastic dynamic programming model for reservoir operations are developed in order to effectively use the ensemble precipitation forecast. To explore the best way for using the ensemble precipitation forecast, two post-processing techniques, i.e., ensemble forecast averaging (EFA) and interval value (IV), are tested. The ensemble precipitation forecast from the European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts (ECMWF) was chosen due to its high accuracy, and the Huanren reservoir, located in China, was used to test the newly developed models. The results show that, compared with the traditional rule curve, hydropower generation increases by 4.86% and 4.55%, respectively, when EFA and IV are used, which indicates that the use of ensemble forecasts facilitates considerable improvements in operating performance.",https://doi.org/10.2166/ws.2018.105,10.2166/ws.2018.105,"Peng, Anbang; Zhang, Xiaoli; Peng, Yong; Xu, Wei; You, Fangfang",WATER SUPPLY,ensemble precipitation forecasts; inflow forecast; reservoir operation; stochastic dynamic programming model,XINANJIANG MODEL,,IWA PUBLISHING,LONDON,"ALLIANCE HOUSE, 12 CAXTON ST, LONDON SW1H0QS, ENGLAND",1606-9749,1607-0798,,WATER SUPPLY,Water Supply,MAR,2019,19,2,588,595,,
706,Hybrid artificial neural network and cooperation search algorithm for nonlinear river flow time series forecasting in humid and semi-humid regions,"Accurate river flow forecasting is of great importance for the scientific management of water resources system. With the advantages of easy implementation and high flexibility, artificial neural network (ANN) has been widely employed to address the complex hydrological forecasting problem. However, the conventional ANN method often suffers from some defects in practice, like slow convergence and local minimum. In order to enhance the ANN performance, this study proposes a hybrid river flow forecasting method by integrating the novel cooperation search algorithm (CSA) into the learning process of ANN. In other words, the computational parameters of the ANN network (like threshold and linking weights) are iteratively optimized by the CSA method in the feasible state space. The proposed method is applied to the river flow data collected from two real-world hydrological stations in China. Several Quantitative indexes are chosen to compare the performance of the developed models, while the comprehensive analysis between the simulated and observed flow data are conducted. The experimental results show that in different scenarios, the hybrid method based on ANN and CSA always outperforms the control models and yields superior forecasting results during both training and testing phases. In Three Gorges Project, the presented method makes 11.10% and 5.42% improvements in the Nash-Sutcliffe efficiency and Coefficient correlation values of the standard ANN method in the testing phase. Thus, this interesting finding shows that the performance of the artificial intelligence models in river flow time series forecasting can be effectively improved by metaheuristic algorithm with outstanding global search ability.

707,Pioneer use of gene expression programming for predicting seasonal streamflow in Australia using large scale climate drivers,"This paper presents development of an artificial intelligence (AI)-based model, genetic expression programming (GEP) to predict long-term streamflow using large-scale climate drivers as predictors. GEP is chosen over artificial neural networks (ANNs) model, as ANN is a black-box model, whereas GEP is able to explain the developed forecast models with mathematical expressions. As a case study, 12 streamflow measuring stations were selected from four different regions of New South Wales (NSW) in eastern Australia. A number of climate indices, Pacific Decadal Oscillation (PDO), Indian Ocean Dipole (IOD), El Nino Southern Oscillation (ENSO) and ENSO Modoki index (EMI), were selected as candidate predictors based on the findings of some preliminary studies. Higher predictabilities of the GEP-based models are evident from the Pearson correlation (r) values ranging between 0.57 and 0.97, which are mostly about twice the values achieved by multiple linear regression (MLR) models in the preliminary study. Performances of the developed models were assessed using standard statistical measures such as root relative squared error (RRSE), relative absolute error (RAE), root mean square error (RMSE), mean absolute error (MAE), Nash-Sutcliffe efficiency (NSE) and Pearson correlation (r) values. The developed models are able to predict spring streamflow up to 5 months in advance with significantly high correlation values.",https://doi.org/10.1002/eco.2242,10.1002/eco.2242,"Esha, Rijwana; Imteaz, Monzur Alam",ECOHYDROLOGY,EMI; ENSO; GEP; IOD; PDO and streamflow,EASTERN AUSTRALIA; EL-NINO; SOUTHERN-OSCILLATION; NEURAL-NETWORK; RAINFALL; VARIABILITY; RUNOFF; CATCHMENT; DROUGHT; MODELS,,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",1936-0584,1936-0592,,ECOHYDROLOGY,Ecohydrology,DEC,2020,13,8,,,e2242,
708,Forecasting of Vessel Traffic Flow Using BPNN Based on Genetic Algorithm Optimization,"Accurate prediction of vessel traffic flow plays a significant role in the field of modern intelligent transportation system. In order to enhance the prediction accuracy of vessel traffic flow, this paper combines genetic algorithm (GA) and Back Propagation neural network (BPNN) to build a prediction model. Based on the vessel traffic flow data of The Wuhan Yangtze River Bridge, the simulation experiments were carried out from 2013 to 2018. The average relative error of BPNN optimized by GA is 4.03%, which is better than the average relative error of direct BPNN prediction is 5.57%. The results show that accuracy of the prediction model using BPNN with GA optimization is higher than the traditional BPNN. The BPNN optimized by GA has achieved more ideal results in the forecast of vessel traffic flow. This paper provides the theoretical basis for the relevant decision-making of the water safety authorities so as to guarantee the water traffic safety.",https://doi.org/10.1109/IWCMC51323.2021.9498607,10.1109/IWCMC51323.2021.9498607,"Yi, Qihang; Zuo, Yi; Li, Tieshan; Mao, Yuhao; Xiao, Yang",IWCMC 2021: 2021 17TH INTERNATIONAL WIRELESS COMMUNICATIONS & MOBILE COMPUTING CONFERENCE (IWCMC),Vessel traffic flow; prediction model; BP neural network; genetic algorithm; parameter optimization,,,IEEE,NEW YORK,"345 E 47TH ST, NEW YORK, NY 10017 USA",2376-6492,,978-1-7281-8616-0,INT WIREL COMMUN,,,2021,,,1059,1063,,
709,A hybrid of Random Forest and Deep Auto-Encoder with support vector regression methods for accuracy improvement and uncertainty reduction of long-term streamflow prediction,"Streamflow forecasting is an important component of water resources planning and management. Data-Driven Models (DDMs) are common approaches for streamflow prediction. DDMs try to obtain a mathematical relation between variables without any prior knowledge or assumption about the physical relation between them. Hence, these models are effective for complex process modeling. In this study, we use the Support Vector Regression (SVR) and Multiple Linear Regression (MLR) models for long-term streamflow prediction. Moreover, three approaches, Random Forest (RF), Deep Auto-Encoder (DAE), and Principle Component Analysis method (PCA) are employed as pre-processing methods and they are combined to SVR and MLR (six hybrid models produced) in order to improve the accuracy of prediction and reduce its uncertainty. Different evaluation criteria, including R-2, RMSE, NSE, P-factor, and R-factor are computed to evaluate the efficiency of the hybrid models. The results of our study on Bookan dam indicate that the DAE-SVR model, in comparison with the PCA-MLR, RF-MLR, DAE-MLR, PCA-SVR hybrid models, provides a significant improvement in the runoff prediction accuracy and the reduction of its uncertainty. DAE-SVR and RF-SVR have the highest values in NSE (0.93 and 0.87, respectively), and the lowest values in RMSE (33.85 and 43.68 MCM, respectively) for the first forecast horizon. The uncertainty analysis of the streamflow prediction shows that DAE-SVR has the best performance at the 95% confidence level due to its P-factor and R-factor values (0.9 and 0.64, respectively). Furthermore, the DAE-SVR performance is likewise better than other hybrid models in the two, three, and four months forecast horizons.",https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jhydrol.2020.125717,10.1016/j.jhydrol.2020.125717,"Abbasi, Mahdi; Farokhnia, Ashkan; Bahreinimotlagh, Masoud; Roozbahani, Reza",JOURNAL OF HYDROLOGY,Long-term streamflow prediction; Dimension reduction approach; Variable selection approach; Random Forest; Deep Auto-Encoder; Support vector regression,MODELS; SELECTION; NETWORK; SVM,,ELSEVIER,AMSTERDAM,"RADARWEG 29, 1043 NX AMSTERDAM, NETHERLANDS",0022-1694,1879-2707,,J HYDROL,J.

710,Inter-comparison between retrospective ensemble streamflow forecasts using meteorological inputs from ECMWF and NOAA/ESRL in the Hudson River sub-basins during Hurricane Irene (2011),"The objective of this work was to evaluate the benefits of using multi-model meteorological ensembles in representing the uncertainty of hydrologic forecasts. An inter-comparison experiment was performed using meteorological inputs from different models corresponding to Hurricane Irene (2011), over three sub-basins of the Hudson River basin. The ensemble-based precipitation inputs were used as forcing in a hydrological model to retrospectively forecast hourly streamflow, with a 96-hour lead time. The inputs consisted of 73 ensemble members, namely one high-resolution ECMWF deterministic member, 51 ECMWF members and 21 NOAA/ESRL (GEFS Reforecasts v2) members. The precipitation inputs were resampled to a common grid using the bilinear resampling method that was selected upon analysing different resampling methods. The results show the advantages of forcing hydrologic forecasting systems with multi-model ensemble forecasts over using deterministic and single model ensemble forecasts. The work showed that using the median of all 73 ensemble streamflow forecasts relatively improved the Nash-Sutcliffe Efficiency and lowered the biases across the examined sub-basins, compared with using the ensemble median from an individual model. This research contributes to the growing literature that demonstrates the promising capabilities of multi-model systems to better describe the uncertainty in streamflow predictions.",https://doi.org/10.2166/nh.2018.182,10.2166/nh.2018.182,"Saleh, F.; Ramaswamy, V; Georgas, N.; Blumberg, A.

711,Prediction of macrophyte distribution: The role of natural versus anthropogenic physical disturbances,"QuestionsDo natural and anthropogenic physical disturbances equally affect the distribution of aquatic plant communities? Can hydrodynamic and geomorphological features be used to predict the establishment of macrophyte communities at the shoreline scale? LocationsTwo large, shallow lakes, southwest France. MethodsBased on field observations (vegetation occurrence and anthropogenic modifications of the shore) and data generated by a geographic information system (wave exposure, wave-induced sediment re-suspension, slope and land cover), we defined sites and community groups using cluster and indicator species analyses. The groups were then analysed by means of a statistical classifier (Random Forest). These different steps in data treatment enabled us to characterize the importance of each physical factor in determining macrophyte occurrence and distribution. As a result, a predictive map to forecast aquatic plant distribution at the shoreline scale was obtained. ResultsAnthropogenic disturbances were less important parameters than natural physical variables in structuring the distribution of lakeshore macrophytes. Within natural factors, wave-induced sediment re-suspension and slope had the most impact; nevertheless, the presence of swimming areas seemed to have a strong impact on aquatic habitats, being correlated with the total absence of aquatic vegetation. The predictive map obtained through the model spatially defined the position and occurrence of suitable sites for the settlement of both invasive and rare and endangered species. ConclusionsIn this study, natural disturbances play a major role in structuring aquatic plant distribution over physical anthropogenic factors. The model contributes to improving knowledge on plant communities with respect to local hydrodynamic and morphological features of lakeshores. Furthermore, the model provides a predictive map as a useful tool for the management of aquatic vegetation in temperate shallow lakes.",https://doi.org/10.1111/avsc.12378,10.1111/avsc.12378,"Bertrin, Vincent; Boutry, Sebastien; Alard, Didier; Haury, Jacques; Jan, Gwilherm; Moreira, Sylvia; Ribaudo, Cristina",APPLIED VEGETATION SCIENCE,aquatic weeds; distribution model; hydromorphological alteration; isoetids; lakeshore zone; softwater lakes; variable importance; vegetation management; wave action,AQUATIC PLANTS; MORPHOLOGICAL TRAITS; LOBELIA-DORTMANNA; WAVE EXPOSURE; WATER PLANTS; LAKE; VEGETATION; SEDIMENT; GROWTH; DEPTH,,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",1402-2001,1654-109X,,APPL VEG SCI,Appl.

712,The Comparison of Grey System and the Verhulst Model for Rainfall and Water in Dam Prediction,"A time series of data of rainfall in Thailand between the years 2005 and 2015 was employed to predict possible future rainfall based on Julong Deng's grey systems theory and the grey Verhulst model to see which model can predict more accurately with uncertain and limited data. Firstly, the rainfall data were arranged to display the overall patterns of rainfall volume along with its frequency as well as the temperature during Thailand's rainy seasons. This makes it possible to see the cycle of rainfall, which is too long for people to intuitively understand the nature of precipitation. One puzzling phenomenon that has made rainfall forecast elusive is the unpredictability of the haphazard nature of rainfall in Thailand. A more precise prediction would certainly result in a better control of water volume in rivers and dams for fruitful agricultural business and adequate human consumption. This can also prevent the flooding that can devastate the economy and transportation of the whole country and also tremendously improve the future water management policy in many ways. This effective prediction could also be employed elsewhere around the globe for similar benefits. Hence, the grey systems theory and the grey Verhulst model are juxtaposed to determine a better prediction possible.",https://doi.org/10.1155/2018/7169130,10.1155/2018/7169130,"Puripat, Chalermchai; Sarikavanij, Sukuman",ADVANCES IN METEOROLOGY,,,,HINDAWI LTD,LONDON,"ADAM HOUSE, 3RD FLR, 1 FITZROY SQ, LONDON, W1T 5HF, ENGLAND",1687-9309,1687-9317,,ADV METEOROL,Adv.

713,A Nonlinear Autoregressive Modeling Approach for Forecasting Groundwater Level Fluctuation in Urban Aquifers,"The application of a nonlinear autoregressive modeling approach with exogenous input (NARX) neural networks for modeling groundwater level fluctuation has been examined by several researchers. However, the suitability of NARX in modeling groundwater level dynamics in urbanized and arid aquifer systems has not been comprehensively investigated. In this study, a NARX-based modeling approach is presented to establish a robust water management tool to aid urban water managers in controlling the development of shallow water tables induced by artificial recharge activity. Temperature data series are used as exogenous inputs for the NARX network, as they better reflect the intensity of artificial recharge activities, such as excessive lawns irrigation. Input delays and feedback delays for the NARX networks are determined based on the autocorrelation and cross-correlation analyses of detrended groundwater levels and monthly temperature averages. The validation of the proposed approach is assessed through a rolling validation procedure. Four observation wells in Kuwait City are selected to test the applicability of the proposed approach. The results showed the superiority of the NARX-based approach in modeling groundwater levels in such an urbanized and arid aquifer system, with coefficient of determination (R-2) values ranging between 0.762 and 0.994 in the validation period. Comparison with other statistical models applied to the same study area shows that NARX models presented here reduced the mean absolute error (MAE) of groundwater levels forecasts by 50%. The findings of this paper are promising and provide a valuable tool for the urban city planner to assist in controlling the problem of shallow water tables for similar climatic and aquifer systems.",https://doi.org/10.3390/w12030820,10.3390/w12030820,"Alsumaiei, Abdullah A.",WATER,groundwater level; NARX network; arid region; artificial recharge; urban area,ARTIFICIAL NEURAL-NETWORKS; FUZZY INFERENCE SYSTEM; SUBSURFACE-WATER RISE; PREDICTION; SIMULATION; ALGORITHM; ANN,,MDPI,BASEL,"ST ALBAN-ANLAGE 66, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND",,2073-4441,,WATER-SUI,Water,MAR,2020,12,3,,,820,
