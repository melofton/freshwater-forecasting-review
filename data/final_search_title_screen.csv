Two of the most ubiquitous stressors are climate change and non-point source nutrient pollution. Agricultural conservation practices (ACPs, i.e. farming practices that reduce runoff, prevent erosion, and curb excessive nutrient loading) offer a potential means to mitigate the negative effects of non-point source pollution on fish populations. However, our understanding of how ACP implementation amidst a changing climate will affect fish production in large ecosystems that receive substantial upstream sediment and nutrient inputs remains incomplete. Towards this end, we explored how anticipated climate change and the implementation of realistic ACPs might alter the recruitment dynamics of three fish populations (native walleye Sander vitreus and yellow perch Perca flavescens and invasive white perch Morone americana) in the highly productive, dynamic west basin of Lake Erie. We projected future (2020-2065) recruitment under different combinations of anticipated climate change (n = 2 levels) and ACP implementation (n = 4 levels) in the western Lake Erie catchment using predictive biological models driven by forecasted winter severity, spring warming rate, and Maumee River total phosphorus loads that were generated from linked climate, catchment-hydrology, and agricultural-practice-simulation models. In general, our models projected reduced walleye and yellow perch recruitment whereas invasive white perch recruitment was projected to remain stable or increase relative to the recent past. Our modelling also suggests the potential for trade-offs, as ACP implementation was projected to reduce yellow perch recruitment with anticipated climate change. Overall, our study presents a useful modelling framework to forecast fish recruitment in Lake Erie and elsewhere, as well as offering projections and new avenues of research that could help resource management agencies and policy-makers develop adaptive and resilient management strategies in the face of anticipated climate and land-management change.","[Dippold, David A.; Aloysius, Noel R.; Fraker, Michael E.; Ludsin, Stuart A.] Ohio State Univ, Aquat Ecol Lab, Dept Evolut Ecol & Organismal Biol, Columbus, OH 43210 USA; [Aloysius, Noel R.; Martin, Jay F.] Ohio State Univ, Dept Food Agr & Biol Engn, Columbus, OH 43210 USA; [Keitzer, Steven Conor] Tusculum Univ, Dept Nat Sci, Tusculum, TN USA; [Yen, Haw; Daggupati, Prasad] Texas A&M Univ, Blackland Res & Extens Ctr, College Stn, TX USA; [Arnold, Jeffrey G.; White, Mike J.] Agr Res Ctr, USDA, Temple, TX USA; [Robertson, Dale M.] US Geol Survey, Upper Midwest Water Sci Ctr, Middleton, WI USA; [Sowa, Scott P.] Michigan Field Off, Nat Conservancy, Lansing, MI USA; [Johnson, Mari-Vaughn V.] USDA, Resource Assessment Div, Nat Resources Conservat Serv, Temple, TX USA; [Aloysius, Noel R.] Univ Missouri, Coll Agr Food & Nat Resources, Columbia, MO USA; [Daggupati, Prasad] Univ Guelph, Sch Engn, Guelph, ON, Canada",,"Ludsin, SA (corresponding author), Ohio State Univ, Aquat Ecol Lab, Dept Evolut Ecol & Organismal Biol, Columbus, OH 43210 USA.",ludsin.1@osu.edu,"Robertson, Dale/O-1913-2018","Robertson, Dale/0000-0001-6799-0596; Yen, Haw/0000-0002-5509-8792; Aloysius, Noel/0000-0002-9094-427X; Keitzer, Steven/0000-0002-8164-4099; Fraker, Michael/0000-0002-1813-706X; Sowa, Scott/0000-0002-5425-2591; Martin, Jay/0000-0002-1599-5931",Ohio State UniversityOhio State University; United States Department of Agriculture Conservation Effects Assessment Project [GRT00031346]; Great Lakes Fishery Commission [2016_LUD_44056]; Nature Conservancy [GRT00042416]; National Science Foundation Coupled Human and Natural Systems [GRT00022685],"The Ohio State University; United States Department of Agriculture Conservation Effects Assessment Project, Grant/Award Number: GRT00031346; Great Lakes Fishery Commission, Grant/Award Number: 2016_LUD_44056; Nature Conservancy, Grant/Award Number: GRT00042416; National Science Foundation Coupled Human and Natural Systems, Grant/Award Number: GRT00022685",,140,9,9,3,33,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0046-5070,1365-2427,,FRESHWATER BIOL,Freshw.

To explore this issue, we forecasted how the stream fish communities in the Western Lake Erie Basin (WLEB) would respond to increasing amounts of agricultural conservation practice (ACP) implementation under two IPCC future greenhouse gas emission scenarios (RCP4.5: moderate reductions; RCP8.5: business-as-usual conditions) during 2020-2065. We used output from 19 General Circulation Models to drive linked agricultural land use (APEX), watershed hydrology (SWAT), and stream fish distribution (boosted regression tree) models, subsequently analyzing how projected changes in habitat would influence fish community composition and functional trait diversity. Our models predicted both positive and negative effects of climate change and ACP implementation on WLEB stream fishes. For most species, climate and ACPs influenced species in the same direction, with climate effects outweighing those of ACP implementation. Functional trait analysis helped clarify the varied responses among species, indicating that more extreme climate change would reduce available habitat for large-bodied, cool-water species with equilibrium life-histories, many of which also are of importance to recreational fishing (e.g., northern pike, smallmouth bass). By contrast, available habitat forwarm-water, benthic species with more periodic or opportunistic life-histories (e.g., northern hogsucker, greater redhorse, greenside darter) was predicted to increase. Further, ACP implementation was projected to hasten these shifts, suggesting that efforts to improve water quality could come with costs to other ecosystem services (e.g., recreational fishing opportunities). Collectively, our findings demonstrate the need to consider biological outcomes when developing strategies to mitigate water quality impairment and highlight the value of physical-biological modeling approaches to agricultural and biological conservation planning in a changing climate.

There is a wide range of hydrology models using lumped conceptual approaches all the way to more physically based distributed algorithms. Most of these models come with a steep learning curve before they can be used efficiently by the end user, and they can be tricky to calibrate appropriately. Only a small number of hydrology models can be considered easy to set up and use, and even fewer provide their source code for easy modification to be tailored to individual needs. These drawbacks make it difficult to use these models in educational applications. The goal of this paper is to introduce a very simple, yet efficient, lumped-conceptual hydrological model designed to address the above problems. The MATLAB-based HMETS hydrological model is simple and can be easily and quickly set up on a new watershed, including automatic calibration using state of the art optimization algorithms. Despite its simplicity, the model has proved to perform well against two other lumped-conceptual hydrological models over 320 watersheds. HMETS obtained a median Nash-Sutcliffe Efficiency of 0.72 in validation, compared to 0.64 for MOHYSE (similar structure) and 0.77 for HSAMI (more complex structure). The model's source code is freely available and includes an optional simplified user interface. A climate change impacts simulation tool using the constant scaling downscaling method is also incorporated to the interface. HMETS has been tested in the Construction Engineering Final-Year Project for a group of 60 undergraduate students.","[Martel, Jean-Luc; Brissette, Francois; Poulin, Annie] Ecole Technol Super, 1100 Notre Dame West St, Montreal, PQ H3C 1K3, Canada; [Demeester, Kenjy] Ecole Polytech Montreal, 2900 Blvd Edouard Monpetit, Montreal, PQ H3T 1J4, Canada; [Arsenault, Richard] Rio Tinto, Quebec Power Operat, 1954 Davis St, Jonquiere, PQ G7S 3B6, Canada",,"Martel, JL (corresponding author), Ecole Technol Super, 1100 Notre Dame West St, Montreal, PQ H3C 1K3, Canada.",jean-luc.martel.1@ens.etsmtl.ca; kenjy.demeester@polymtl.ca; francois.brissette@etsmtl.ca; annie.poulin@etsmtl.ca; richard.arsenault@riotinto.com,,"Martel, Jean-Luc/0000-0001-7142-6875",,,,23,34,35,1,10,TEMPUS PUBLICATIONS,"DURRUS, BANTRY","IJEE , ROSSMORE,, DURRUS, BANTRY, COUNTY CORK 00000, IRELAND",0949-149X,,,INT J ENG EDUC,Int.

Typically, current and projected air temperatures are used to forecast future distributions of invasive species based on climate matching in an ecological niche modeling approach. While this approach was originally developed for terrestrial species, it has also been widely applied to aquatic species even though aquatic species do not experience air temperatures directly. In the case of lakes, species respond to lake thermal regimes, which reflect the interaction of climate and lake attributes such as depth, size, and clarity. The result is that adjacent waterbodies can differ notably in thermal regime. Given these obvious limitations of modeling aquatic species distributions using climate data, we take advantage of recent advances in simulating lake thermal regimes to model the distributions of invasive spiny water flea (Bythotrephes cederstromii) for current and projected future climates in the upper Midwest of the USA. We compared predictions and future projections from models based on modeled air temperatures with models based on modeled water temperature. All models predicted that the number of suitable lakes in the region will decrease with climate change. Models based on air and water temperature differed dramatically in the extent of this decrease. The air temperature model predicted 89% of study lakes to be suitable, with suitability declining dramatically in the late century with climate warming to just a single suitable lake. Lake suitability predictions from the water temperature model declined to a much lesser degree with warming (42% of lakes were predicted to be suitable, declining to 19% in the late century) and were more spatially independent. Our results expose the limitations of using air temperatures to model habitat suitability for aquatic species, and our study further highlights the importance of understanding lake-specific responses to climate when assessing aquatic species responses to climate change. While we project a contraction in the potential range ofBythotrepheswith warming in the study region, we anticipate thatBythotrepheswill likely continue to expand into new lakes that will remain suitable in the following decades.","[Walsh, Jake R.; Vander Zanden, M.

However, climate change represents a main barrier to fully realizing a BE. Enabling conditions that will support the sustainable development of a BE and increase its climate resiliency must be promoted. Romania has high potential to contribute to the development of the EU BE due to its geographic characteristics, namely the presence of the Danube Delta-Black Sea macrosystem, which is part of the Romanian Lower Danube Euroregion (RLDE). Aquatic living resources represent a sector which can significantly contribute to the growth of the BE in the RLDE, a situation which imposes restrictions for both halting biodiversity loss and maintaining the proper conditions to maximize the benefits of the existing macrosystem. It is known that climate change causes water quality problems, accentuates water level fluctuations and loss of biodiversity and induces the destruction of habitats, which eventually leads to fish stock depletion. This paper aims to develop an analytical framework based on multiple linear predictive and forecast models that offers cost-efficient tools for the monitoring and control of water quality, fish stock dynamics and biodiversity in order to strengthen the resilience and adaptive capacity of the BE of the RLDE in the context of climate change. The following water-dependent variables were considered: total nitrogen (TN); total phosphorus (TP); dissolved oxygen (DO); pH; water temperature (wt); and water level, all of which were measured based on a series of 26 physicochemical indicators associated with 4 sampling areas within the RLDE (Braila, Galati, Tulcea and Sulina counties). Predictive models based on fish species catches associated with the Galati County Danube River Basin segment and the Danube Delta Biosphere Reserve Administration territory were included in the analytical framework to establish an efficient tool for monitoring fish stock dynamics and structures as well as identify methods of controlling fish biodiversity in the RLDE to enhance the sustainable development and resilience of the already-existing BE and its expansion (blue growth) in the context of aquatic environment climate variation. The study area reflects the integrated approach of the emerging BE, focused on the ocean, seas, lakes and rivers according to the United Nations Agenda. The results emphasized the vulnerability of the RLDE to climate change, a situation revealed by the water level, air temperature and water quality parameter trend lines and forecast models. Considering the sampling design applied within the RLDE, it can be stated that the Tulcea county Danube sector was less affected by climate change compared with the Galati county sector as confirmed by water TN and TP forecast analysis, which revealed higher increasing trends in Galati compared with Tulcea. The fish stock biodiversity was proven to be affected by global warming within the RLDE, since peaceful species had a higher upward trend compared with predatory species. Water level and air temperature forecasting analysis proved to be an important tool for climate change monitoring in the study area. The resulting analytical framework confirmed that time series methods could be used together with machine learning prediction methods to highlight their synergetic abilities for monitoring and predicting the impact of climate change on the marine living resources of the BE sector within the RLDE. The forecasting models developed in the present study were meant to be used as methods of revealing future information, making it possible for decision makers to adopt proper management solutions to prevent or limit the negative impacts of climate change on the BE. Through the identified independent variables, prediction models offer a solution for managing the dependent variables and the possibility of performing less cost-demanding aquatic environment monitoring activities.","[Petrea, Stefan Mihai; Simionov, Ira Adeline; Mogodan, Alina] Univ Galatzi, Fac Food Sci & Engn, Food Sci Food Engn Biotechnol & Aquaculture Dept, Galati 800008, Romania; [Zamfir, Cristina; Cristea, Dragos Sebastian; Buhociu, Florin Marian] Univ Galatzi, Fac Econ & Business Adm, Business Adm Dept, Galati 800008, Romania; [Nuta, Florian Marcel] Danubius Univ Galati, Fac Econ, Finance & Business Adm Dept, Galati 800654, Romania; [Rahoveanu, Adrian Turek] Univ Agron Sci & Vet Med Bucharest, Fac Management & Rural Dev, Bucharest 011464, Romania; [Nancu, Dumitru] Bucharest Univ Econ Studies, Finance & Accountings Dept, Bucharest 010374, Romania",,"Cristea, DS (corresponding author), Univ Galatzi, Fac Econ & Business Adm, Business Adm Dept, Galati 800008, Romania.",floriann@univ-danubius.ro; aditurek@yahoo.com; dumitru.nancu@gmail.com,,"Nuta, Florian Marcel/0000-0001-8663-4183","Romanian National Authority for Scientific Research and Innovation, CNCS/CCCDI-UEFISCDI project within PNCDI IIIConsiliul National al Cercetarii Stiintifice (CNCS)Unitatea Executiva pentru Finantarea Invatamantului Superior, a Cercetarii, Dezvoltarii si Inovarii (UEFISCDI) [PN-III-P2-2.1-PTE-2019-0697]","This work was supported by a grant from the Romanian National Authority for Scientific Research and Innovation, CNCS/CCCDI-UEFISCDI, project PN-III-P2-2.1-PTE-2019-0697 within PNCDI III.",,104,0,0,6,6,MDPI,BASEL,"ST ALBAN-ANLAGE 66, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND",,2071-1050,,SUSTAINABILITY-BASEL,Sustainability,NOV,2021,13,21,,,,,,,11563,10.3390/su132111563,,,36,Green & Sustainable Science & Technology; Environmental Sciences; Environmental Studies,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Science & Technology - Other Topics; Environmental Sciences & Ecology,XA2FM,WOS:000720469700001,,gold,,,2022-02-17

The approach allows to (i) handle the uncertainty associated with the projection of climate variables, (ii) preserve an accurate description of flow and transport processes, and (iii) drastically accelerate computationally intensive simulations, at a time. A long-term climate scenario (i.e. referred to the 30-years 2061-2090) is developed for the study area by considering changes in the natural recharge to groundwater, the baseflow of the main rivers, and the rate of nitrate leaching. Global sensitivity analysis is performed to assess the relative influence of these factors on the quantity of interest (QoI), i.e. the long-term prediction of groundwater nitrate concentration. Our analysis enables also us to compute the spatial statistics and variability of the moments of the QoI over the study area and to perform Monte Carlo simulations to fully characterize the probabilistic behavior of the QoI at selected sensitive locations.","[Focaccia, S.; Ciriello, V] Univ Bologna, Dipartimento Ingn Civile Chim Ambientale & Mat DI, Bologna, Italy; [Panini, G.; Pedrazzoli, P.] IRETI SpA, Reggio Emilia, Italy",,"Ciriello, V (corresponding author), Univ Bologna, Dipartimento Ingn Civile Chim Ambientale & Mat DI, Bologna, Italy.",v.ciriello@unibo.it,"Ciriello, Valentina/L-6369-2013","Ciriello, Valentina/0000-0002-1670-6740","University of Bologna RFO (Ricerca Fondamentale Orientata); BIR (Budget Integrato per la Ricerca); Department of Civil, Chemical, Environ-mental and Materials Engineering (DICAM) of the University of Bologna","Authors are thankful to the 2 Reviewers, Editor and Associate Editor for the time invested in the review process as well as the constructive comments that helped improve the overall quality of this work.

In this study, a multi-scenario ensemble streamflow forecast (MESF) method is developed for analyzing the streamflow variation under considering climate and land-use changes, through incorporating CA-Markov model, global climate model (GCM) and Soil and Water Assessment Tool (SWAT) model within a general framework. The advantages of MESF are as follows: (i) it can simultaneously assess the impacts of land-use and climate changes on streamflow; (ii) it can obtain the possible trend and the range of future streamflows through ensemble forecast under multiple scenarios; (iii) based on analysis of streamflow processes under extreme scenarios, it can examine the effects of key factors on streamflow. The MESF method is applied to the upper reaches of the Amu Darya River Basin in Central Asia. Totally 72 scenarios, under different land-use patterns, GCMs and Representative Concentration Pathways (RCPs), are analyzed. Ensemble forecast results reveal that (i) during 2021-2050, the average annual precipitation and the average annual temperature would both increase, but the mean annual streamflow would decrease; (ii) compared to the impact of land-use change, climate change has more obvious effects on the streamflow (with contribution of 78.8%-98.7%); (iii) among all factors of land-use change, glacier melting triggered by climate warming is the most prominent factor; (iv) the peak flow in one year would have a tendency to shift from summer to spring due to the rising temperature and the speeding up snow melt.","[Xu, Z.

This provides a potential resource to predict the influence of seasonal climate anomalies on surface water balance in catchments and hydro-thermodynamics in related water bodies (e.g., lakes or reservoirs). Obtaining seasonal forecasts for impact variables (e.g., discharge and water temperature) requires a link between seasonal climate forecasts and impact models simulating hydrology and lake hydrodynamics and thermal regimes. However, this link remains challenging for stakeholders and the water scientific community, mainly due to the probabilistic nature of these predictions. In this paper, we introduce a feasible, robust, and open-source workflow integrating seasonal climate forecasts with hydrologic and lake models to generate seasonal forecasts of discharge and water temperature profiles. The workflow has been designed to be applicable to any catchment and associated lake or reservoir, and is optimized in this study for four catchment-lake systems to help in their proactive management. We assessed the performance of the resulting seasonal forecasts of discharge and water temperature by comparing them with hydrologic and lake (pseudo)observations (reanalysis). Precisely, we analysed the historical performance using a data sample of past forecasts and reanalysis to obtain information about the skill (performance or quality) of the seasonal forecast system to predict particular events. We used the current seasonal climate forecast system (SEAS5) and reanalysis (ERA5) of the European Centre for Medium Range Weather Forecasts (ECMWF). We found that due to the limited predictability at seasonal time-scales over the locations of the four case studies (Europe and South of Australia), seasonal forecasts exhibited none to low performance (skill) for the atmospheric variables considered. Nevertheless, seasonal forecasts for discharge present some skill in all but one case study. Moreover, seasonal forecasts for water temperature had higher performance in natural lakes than in reservoirs, which means human water control is a relevant factor affecting predictability, and the performance increases with water depth in all four case studies. Further investigation into the skillful water temperature predictions should aim to identify the extent to which performance is a consequence of thermal inertia (i.e., lead-in conditions).

Six research questions are proposed: (i) How can we improve the access to input data for hydrological and ecological modeling? (ii) What is the role of glacier and snow in modifying the hydrological services? (iii) How can we best assess hydrologic services supplies and demands with the available data and tools? (iv) What will be the impact of the main hydrologic changes on species diversity in rivers? (v) Can we meet the targets of multi-sectorial river-related policies under different climate and landuse forecasting scenarios? (vi) How detailed do ES data and models need to be to answer relevant policy questions? The above questions are tackled through an integrated framework to access, share, process, model, and deliberate on hydrologic ecosystems services. State-of-the-art models have been selected, and will be compared and improved to model different ecosystems and their services. Initial results from a first SWAT model of Switzerland and Species Distribution Models are presented. Expected outputs from various climate and land use change scenarios include rivers' hydrology, predicted biodiversity, and the assessment of ecosystem services in terms of provisioning services (e.g. water resources), regulating services (e.g. nutrient, sediment and flood water retention), and cultural services (e.g. biodiversity, recreation). The expected outcome of the project is to improve integrated evidence-based water policy in the future through the analysis of tradeoffs and synergies between services.

CRB operational seasonal streamflow forecasts are produced using ESP, which represents climate using an ensemble of meteorological sequences of historical temperature and precipitation, but do not typically leverage additional real-time subseasonal-to-seasonal climate forecasts. Any improvements to streamflow forecasts would help stakeholders who depend on operational projections for decision making. We explore incorporating climate forecasts into ESP through variations on an ESP trace weighting approach, focusing on Colorado River unregulated inflows forecasts to Lake Powell. The k-nearest neighbors (kNN) technique is employed using North American Multi-Model Ensemble one- and three-month temperature and precipitation forecasts, and preceding three-month historical streamflow, as weighting factors. The benefit of disaggregated climate forecast information is assessed through the comparison of two kNN weighting strategies; a basin-wide kNN uses the same ESP weights over the entire basin, and a disaggregated-basin kNN applies ESP weights separately to four subbasins. We find in general that climate-informed forecasts add greater marginal skill in late winter and early spring, and that more spatially granular disaggregated-basin use of climate forecasts slightly improves skill over the basin-wide method at most lead times.","[Baker, Sarah A.] US Bur Reclamat Boulder, Lower Colorado Reg, Boulder, CO 89005 USA; [Rajagopalan, Balaji] Univ Colorado, Dept Civil Environm & Architectural Engn, Boulder, CO 80309 USA; [Wood, Andrew W.] Natl Ctr Atmospher Res Boulder, Climate & Global Dynam, Boulder, CO USA",,"Baker, SA (corresponding author), US Bur Reclamat Boulder, Lower Colorado Reg, Boulder, CO 89005 USA.",sabaker@usbr.gov,"Baker, Sarah/N-9269-2018","Baker, Sarah/0000-0002-8240-1873","NOAA's Climate Program Office's Modeling, Analysis, Predictions, and Projections (MAPP) Program [NA16OAR4310138, NA14OAR4310238]; Bureau of Reclamation [R16AC00039]","This study was supported by NOAA's Climate Program Office's Modeling, Analysis, Predictions, and Projections (MAPP) Program under Awards NA16OAR4310138 and NA14OAR4310238, and the Bureau of Reclamation under Cooperative Agreement R16AC00039.

Low flow periods have a direct impact on the environment, on the inland waterway navigation, on the hydropower production as well as on the sediment management, among others. Similar to floods, low flows are naturally occurring phenomena which can significantly hinder different uses and functions of the rivers and impact the aquatic system and the water quality. Moreover, it is projected that, in the future, climate change might lead to drier summers over the European region and therefore to more frequent and severe low flow periods. The results presented here show that the summer 2018 low flow situation, over the Rhine and Elbe Rivers basin, could have been predicted up to two seasons ahead by using previous months' sea surface temperature, sea level pressure, precipitation, mean air temperature and soil moisture. The lagged relationship between the predictand (e.g. seasonal streamflow) and the climate and oceanic predictors varies between 1 month (e.g. precipitation) up to 6 months (e.g. sea surface temperature). Taking into account that all predictors are available in real-time, the forecast scheme can be used to provide early warnings for the upcoming low flow situations, thus offering the possibility for better management of the water resources.","[Ionita, M.; Nagavciuc, V] Helmholtz Ctr Polar & Marine Res, Alfred Wegener Inst, Bussestr 24, D-27570 Bremerhaven, Germany; [Nagavciuc, V] Stefan Cel Mare Univ, Fac Forestry, Suceava 720229, Romania",,"Ionita, M (corresponding author), Helmholtz Ctr Polar & Marine Res, Alfred Wegener Inst, Bussestr 24, D-27570 Bremerhaven, Germany.",Monica.Ionita@awi.de,"Nagavciuc, Viorica/AAJ-4642-2020","Ionita, Monica/0000-0001-8240-4380; Nagavciuc, Viorica/0000-0003-1111-9616",Polar Regions and Coasts in the Changing Earth System (PACES) program of the AWI; AWI Strategy Fund Project-PalEX; Helmholtz Climate Initiative-REKLIM; Projekt DEAL,This study was promoted by Helmholtz funding through the Polar Regions and Coasts in the Changing Earth System (PACES) program of the AWI.

Here, we used random forests to model plankton species and community metrics as a function of biological, climatic, physical, and chemical data from long-term (2000-2017) monitoring data collected from Lake Muggelsee Berlin, Germany. We (1) compared the predictability of well-known lake plankton metric types (biomass, abundance, taxonomic diversity, Shannon diversity, Simpson diversity, evenness, taxonomic distinctness, and taxonomic richness) and (2) assessed how the relative influence of different environmental drivers varies across lake plankton metric models. Overall, the metric predictability was highest for biomass and abundance followed by taxonomic richness. The biomass of dominant phytoplankton taxonomic groups such as cyanobacteria (adjusted-R-2 = 0.53) and the abundance of dominant zooplankton taxonomic groups such as rotifers (adjusted-R-2 = 0.59) and daphnids (adjusted-R-2 = 0.51) were more predictable than other metric types. The plankton metric predictability increased when grouping phytoplankton species according to their functional traits (adjusted-R-2 = 0.37 +/- 0.14, mean +/- SD, n = 36 functional groups) compared to higher taxonomic units (adjusted-R-2 = 0.25 +/- 0.15, n = 22 taxonomic groups). Light, nutrients, water temperature, and seasonality for phytoplankton and food resources for zooplankton were the main drivers of both taxonomic and functional groups, giving confidence that our models captured the expected major environmental drivers. Our quantitative analyses highlight the multidimensionality of lake planktonic responses to environmental drivers and have implications for our capacity to select appropriate metrics for forecasting the future of lake ecosystems under global change scenarios.","[Kakouei, Karan; Kraemer, Benjamin M.; Adrian, Rita] Leibniz Inst Freshwater Ecol & Inland Fisheries I, Dept Ecosyst Res, Berlin, Germany; [Adrian, Rita] Free Univ Berlin, Inst Biol, Berlin, Germany",,"Kakouei, K (corresponding author), Leibniz Inst Freshwater Ecol & Inland Fisheries I, Dept Ecosyst Res, Berlin, Germany.",kakouei@igb-berlin.de,,,LimnoSCenES project [AD 91/22-1]; Belmont Forum; MANTEL-ITN project within the European Union [722518]; Projekt DEAL,"This study was funded through the LimnoSCenES project (Research on social-ecological scenarios for biodiversity and ecosystem service changes in north temperate freshwater ecosystems over the next half century; AD 91/22-1) supported by the network programming and funding research on biodiversity and ecosystem services across European countries and territories (BiodivERsA) and the Belmont Forum.

However, increasing frequency and intensity of precipitation events is necessitating the short-term management of such reservoirs to reduce downstream flooding. Operational management of reservoirs at hourly/daily timescales is challenging due to the uncertainty associated with the inflow forecasts and the volumes in the reservoir. We present an ensemble-based streamflow prediction and optimization framework consisting of a regional scale hydrologic model forced with ensemble precipitation inputs to obtain probabilistic inflows to the reservoir. A multi-objective dynamic programming model was used to obtain optimized release strategies accounting for the inflow uncertainties. The proposed framework was evaluated at a water supply reservoir in the Hackensack River basin in New Jersey during Hurricanes Irene and Sandy. Hurricane Irene resulted in the overtopping of the dam despite releases made in anticipation of the event and resulted in severe downstream flooding. Hurricane Sandy was characterized by low rainfall, however, raised significant concerns of flooding given the nature of the event. The improvement in NSE for the Hurricane Irene inflows from 0.5 to 0.76 and reduction of the spread of PBIAS with decreasing lead times resulted in improvements in the forecast informed releases. This study provides perspectives on the benefits of the proposed forecasting and optimization framework in reducing the decision making burden on the operator by providing the uncertainties associated with the inflows, releases and the water levels in the reservoir.","[Ramaswamy, V.; Saleh, F.] Stevens Inst Technol, Davidson Lab, Dept Civil Environm & Ocean Engn, Hoboken, NJ 07030 USA",,"Ramaswamy, V (corresponding author), Stevens Inst Technol, Davidson Lab, Dept Civil Environm & Ocean Engn, Hoboken, NJ 07030 USA.",arvee1991@gmail.com,"Ramaswamy, Venkatsundar/AAF-5233-2020",,,,,94,7,7,8,21,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0920-4741,1573-1650,,WATER RESOUR MANAG,Water Resour.

Frequent flooding, one of the extremes, needs to be analyzed while considering climate change to mitigate flood risk. This study forecast streamflow and evaluate risk of flooding in the Neuse River, North Carolina considering future climatic scenarios, and comparing them with an existing Federal Emergency Management Agency study. The cumulative distribution function transformation method was adopted for bias correction to reduce the uncertainty present in the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project Phase 6 (CMIP6) streamflow data. To calculate 100-year and 500-year flood discharges, the Generalized Extreme Value (L-Moment) was utilized on bias-corrected multimodel ensemble data with different climate projections. Out of all projections, shared socio-economic pathways (SSP5-8.5) exhibited the maximum design streamflow, which was routed through a hydraulic model, the Hydrological Engineering Center's River Analysis System (HEC-RAS), to generate flood inundation and risk maps. The result indicates an increase in flood inundation extent compared to the existing study, depicting a higher flood hazard and risk in the future. This study highlights the importance of forecasting future flood risk and utilizing the projected climate data to obtain essential information to determine effective strategic plans for future floodplain management.","[Pokhrel, Indira; Kalra, Ajay] Southern Illinois Univ, Sch Civil Environm & Infrastruct Engn, 1230 Lincoln Dr, Carbondale, IL 62901 USA; [Rahaman, Md Mafuzur] AECOM, 2380 McGee St,Suite 200, Kansas City, MO 64108 USA; [Thakali, Ranjeet] Bayer Risse Engn Inc, 78 State Highway 173 W,Suite 6, Hampton, NJ 08827 USA",,"Kalra, A (corresponding author), Southern Illinois Univ, Sch Civil Environm & Infrastruct Engn, 1230 Lincoln Dr, Carbondale, IL 62901 USA.",indira.pokhrel@siu.edu; kalraa@siu.edu; mafuzur.rahaman@aecom.com; rthakali@bayer-risse.com,"Thakali, Ranjeet/K-1405-2019","Thakali, Ranjeet/0000-0001-5698-5601","Office of the Vice-Chancellor for Research at Southern Illinois University, Carbondale","The authors would like to thank the three reviewers for their valuable comments.

The Department of Meteorology and Hydrology (DMH), Myanmar is thus, bestowed with the responsibility of flood forecasting within the country for early warning. This study presents a new web-based Decision Support System (DSS), for DMH's use in operational flood forecasting. The new DSS, that has a forecast lead time of 24-72 h, is a significant improvement over the existing forecasting systems used by DMH, which had a lead time of 4-24 h. Moreover, the new DSS couples Hydrological Engineering Centre Hydrological Modelling System (HEC-HMS) with Weather and Research (WRF) rainfall forecast for Ayeyarwady river basin (ARB), the principle river basin of the country. In addition to the hydro-meteorological coupling, core modules of the DSS include rainfall forecasting, bias correction and flow error correction. The hydrological model setup of the DSS was calibrated and validated for the periods 2008-2012 and 2013-2014 with observed rainfall. The DSS was then actively deployed and tested operationally by DMH using bias-corrected WRF rainfall forecasts for the period 2015-2017. Performance of the system is very good in forecasting flows and floods within ARB, and also provides additional lead time to DMH for issuing the flood advisories. Hence, the novel web-based flood forecasting DSS, is an important applied research contribution, that is being successfully used by the operational staff of DMH for short-term flood forecasting in Myanmar and has the potential to improve flood resiliency of similar agencies in the SEA region.","[Agarwal, Anshul; Ghimire, Uttam; Srinivasan, Govindarajalu; Dash, Itesh; Shakya, Niraj] Reg Integrated Multi Hazard Early Warning Syst, Outreach Bldg,Asian Inst Technol Campus, Klongluang, Pathumthani, Thailand; [Than, Htay Htay; Oo, Myo Tun] Minist Transport & Commun, Dept Meteorol & Hydrol, Nay Pyi Taw, Myanmar",,"Agarwal, A (corresponding author), Reg Integrated Multi Hazard Early Warning Syst, Outreach Bldg,Asian Inst Technol Campus, Klongluang, Pathumthani, Thailand.",anshul@rimes.int,,"Ghimire, Uttam/0000-0003-0336-3731; Agarwal, Anshul/0000-0001-7795-7730",Indian National Centre for Ocean Information Services [88/2014],This work was supported by Indian National Centre for Ocean Information Services: [Grant Number 88/2014].,,64,2,2,0,3,TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD,ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OR14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1571-5124,1814-2060,,INT J RIVER BASIN MA,Int.

Design/methodology/approach - The hybrid models GA-SVM and GA-RVM were developed for the optimal control of parameters for predicting (based on the current month's variables) and forecasting (based on the previous three months' variables) phytoplankton dynamics in a Macau freshwater reservoir, MSR, which has experienced cyanobacterial blooms in recent years. There were 15 environmental parameters, including pH, SiO2, alkalinity, bicarbonate (HCO3-), dissolved oxygen (DO), total nitrogen (TN), UV254, turbidity, conductivity, nitrate (NO3-), orthophosphate (PO43-), total phosphorus (TP), suspended solids (SS) and total organic carbon (TOC) selected from the correlation analysis, with eight years (2001-2008) of data for training, and the most recent three years (2009-2011) for testing. Findings - For both accuracy performance and generalized performance, the ANN, GA-SVM and GA-RVM had similar predictive powers of R-2 of 0.73-0.75. However, whereas ANN and GA-RVM models showed very similar forecast performances, GA-SVM models had better forecast performances of R-2 (0.862), RMSE (0.266) and MAE (0.0710) with the respective parameters of 0.987, 0.161 and 0.032 optimized using GA.

In Europe, the third cycle of river basin management plans (2021-2027) according to the Water Framework Directive must take into account the potential impacts of climate change on water quality, including effects on relevant biological indicators. Here, we applied a Bayesian network as a meta-model for linking future climate and land-use scenarios for the time horizon 2050-2070, via process-based catchment and lake models, to cyanobacteria abundance and ecological status of a eutrophic lake. Building upon previous applications of the model, a new version was developed to include relevant climatic variables such as wind speed. Explorative scenarios showed that the combination of low wind and high temperature gave the most synergistic effects on cyanobacteria under high levels of eutrophication (Chl-a concentration). Considering the management target of good ecological status, however, the climate-related promotion of cyanobacteria blooms contributed most to degrading the ecological status at intermediate levels of eutrophication. Future developments of this model will aim to strengthen the link between climate variables and ecological responses, to make the model also useful for seasonal forecasting.","[Moe, S.

Actual observational data of Armhydromet for maximum flow rate, air temperature and precipitation were used as the source material. The available literature sources were processed and analyzed, the mathematical-statistical, geographical, and also methods of comparison and analysis were applied. To determine the maximum flow rates of the Marmarik River, the Ankavan post and the Gomur River, the Meghradzor post, the winter period precipitation, the sum of positive temperatures, liquid precipitation, the volume of the runoff of the flood period were used, but no reliable dependencies were obtained. Dependencies obtained can be used for consultations. To determine the maximum flow at the Aghavnadzor post of the Marmarik River, a multifactorial correlation close relationship was obtained, which can be used to compile operational forecasts of the maximum flow in this river site. The absolute values of the maximum river flow of the Marmarik River at Aghavnadzor are estimated for different scenarios of climate change. For different scenarios and cases in the Marmarik River basin, a different degree of changes in the maximum flow might be expected. Moreover, the largest decrease in the maximum runoff of the Marmarik River basin is expected under the conditions of an increase in the average air temperature of the spring season by 2.7-3.9 and a decrease in the amount of spring atmospheric precipitation by 2.4-2.6%. As a result of the study, it turned out that in the study area there is only a tendency to decrease the values of maximum water discharge which is the result of both human activities and climate change.","[Margaryan, V.

Nowadays, climate change, floods, and other anomalies occurring more and more frequently and bringing great losses to society. The prediction of streamflow, especially flood prediction, is important for disaster prevention. Current hydrological models based on physical mechanisms can give accurate predictions of streamflow, but the effective prediction period is only about 1 month in advance, which is too short for decision making. The artificial neural network (ANN) has great potential for predicting runoff and is not only good at handling non-linear data but can also make long-period forecasts. However, most of ANN models are unstable in their predictions when faced with raw flow data, and have excessive errors in predicting extreme flows. Previous studies have shown a link between the El Nino-Southern Oscillation (ENSO) and the streamflow of the Yangtze River. In this paper, we use ENSO and the monthly streamflow data of the Yangtze River from 1952 to 2018 to predict the monthly streamflow of the Yangtze River in two extreme flood years and a small flood year by using deep neural networks. In this paper, three deep neural network frameworks are used: stacked long short-term memory, Conv long short-term memory encoder-decoder long short-term memory and Conv long short-term memory encoder-decoder gate recurrent unit. The results show that the use of ConvLSTM improves the stability of the model and increases the accuracy of the flood prediction. Besides, the introduction of ENSO to the experimental data resulted in a more accurate prediction of the time of the occurrence of flood peaks and flood flows. Furthermore, the best results were obtained on the convolutional long short-term memory+encoder-decoder gate recurrent unit model.","[Ha, Si; Liu, Darong; Mu, Lin] China Univ Geosci, Coll Marine Sci & Technol, Wuhan 430074, Peoples R China; [Mu, Lin] Shenzhen Univ, Coll Life Sci & Oceanog, Shenzhen 518060, Peoples R China",,"Liu, DR; Mu, L (corresponding author), China Univ Geosci, Coll Marine Sci & Technol, Wuhan 430074, Peoples R China.; Mu, L (corresponding author), Shenzhen Univ, Coll Life Sci & Oceanog, Shenzhen 518060, Peoples R China.",lidr1169@cug.edu.cn; moulin1977@hotmail.com,,"Liu, Da Rong/0000-0001-7581-6192",Key-Area Research and Development Program of Guangdong Province [2020B1111020005]; National Natural Science Foundation of ChinaNational Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC) [U2006210]; Shenzhen Fundamental Research Program [JCYJ20200109110220482],"This work was supported by the Key-Area Research and Development Program of Guangdong Province (Grant No. 2020B1111020005), National Natural Science Foundation of China (Grant No. U2006210) and Shenzhen Fundamental Research Program (Grant No. JCYJ20200109110220482).",,55,5,5,19,27,NATURE RESEARCH,BERLIN,"HEIDELBERGER PLATZ 3, BERLIN, 14197, GERMANY",2045-2322,,,SCI REP-UK,Sci Rep,JUN 3,2021,11,1,,,,,,,11738,10.1038/s41598-021-90964-3,,,23,Multidisciplinary Sciences,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),Science & Technology - Other Topics,ST1UL,WOS:000662236000033,34083594,"Green Published, gold",,,2022-02-17

Climate change and associated global warming and changes in precipitation patterns, combined with the expansion of generalist -invasive species are two of the main threats. Niche-based models (NBMs) are becoming inevitable tools in invasive species risk assessment and in conservation decision-making. Lithobates catesbeianus is an invasive species globally known for its adverse ecological impacts on native amphibians and biodiversity. To assess species current and future climatic suitable areas at the global and European scales we used an ensemble forecasting approach. We considered six climatic variables, three timeframes (current, 2050, and 2070), and two CO2 emission scenarios. Temperature seasonality, minimum temperature of the coldest month, maximum temperature of the warmest month, and precipitation in the driest month were the most important variables predicting bullfrog occurrence. Globally currently 3.8% of land area is suitable for bullfrog and an increase of up to 5.2% in 2070 is expected. Increase in suitable areas is expected at higher latitudes, especially in North America and central Europe. Currently, 3.45% of total Natura 2000 area is suitable, and a predicted range gain of up to 355.93% (12.28%) is expected in the highest concentration scenarios predictions. This can indicate that the 64 native amphibian species present in the Natura 2000 network could be at increased risk. The choice of Natura 2000 for a geographic detailed analysis of the possible effects on native amphibians is due to its importance for habitats and wildlife conservation.

The resulting eutrophication promotes phytoplankton blooms, in many cases of toxic cyanobacteria. Ecological models can simulate the main processes driving algal blooms. They help to understand how phytoplankton responds to different forcing. Another major use of models is as predictive tool supporting the management of water resources. Yuqiao Reservoir is the main drinking water source for Tianjin, the fifth most populated city in China. During the last decade, drinking water production has been impaired by recurrent cyanobacteria blooms. The water quality management of the reservoir, conducted by the Hai River Water Conservancy Commission, requires an early warning system in order to anticipate the cyanobacteria blooms and to adapt the treatment process. Therefore, within the framework of a French-Chinese project on Integrated Water Resources Management (IWRM) of the catchment of the Hai river, a modelling approach of cyanobacteria growth, which could be later embedded in an early warning system, was proposed. In this study, we calibrated a one-dimensional vertical, physical-ecological model aimed at forecasting cyanobacteria blooms in the Yuqiao Reservoir. We first introduce the study site and its ecological status. Then we describe the model and the input data set. The calibration and validation results are presented for water temperature and chlorophyll-a concentration at the measurement dates. The short-term forecast modelling is performed for temperature and cyanobacteria over a 5-day ahead period.

The concentration of dissolved oxygen (DO) is a primary indicator of the health state of the aquatic habitats, and its modeling is crucial for river water quality management. This paper investigates the importance of the choices of different techniques for preprocessing and stochastic modeling for developing a simple and reliable linear stochastic model for forecasting DO in urban rivers. We describe several methods of evaluation, preprocessing, and modeling for the DO parameter time series in the Credit River, Ontario, Canada, to achieve the optimum data preprocessing and input selection techniques and consequently obtain the optimum performance of the stochastic models as an effective river management tool. The Manly normalization and standardization (S-td) methods were chosen for preprocessing the time series. Modeling the preprocessed time series using the stochastic autoregressive integrated moving average (ARIMA) model resulted in very accurate forecasts with a negligible difference from sole normalization and spectral analysis (S-f) methods.","[Stajkowski, Stephen; Farghaly, Hani; Gharabaghi, Bahram] Univ Guelph, Sch Engn, Guelph, ON NIG 2W1, Canada; [Zeynoddin, Mohammad; Bonakdari, Hossein] Univ Laval, Dept Soils & Agrifood Engn, Quebec City, PQ G1V 0A6, Canada",,"Gharabaghi, B (corresponding author), Univ Guelph, Sch Engn, Guelph, ON NIG 2W1, Canada.; Bonakdari, H (corresponding author), Univ Laval, Dept Soils & Agrifood Engn, Quebec City, PQ G1V 0A6, Canada.",stajkows@uoguelph.ca; mohammad.zeynoddin.1@ulaval.ca; hfarghaly17@gmail.com; bgharaba@uoguelph.ca; hossein.bonakdari@fsaa.ulaval.ca,"Bonakdari, Hossein/AAW-5398-2021; Gharabaghi, Bahram/F-9977-2016; Bonakdari, Hossein/B-9305-2018","Gharabaghi, Bahram/0000-0003-0454-2811; Bonakdari, Hossein/0000-0001-6169-3654",NSERC Discovery GrantNatural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada (NSERC) [400675]; Ontario Ministry of Transportation Grant [050235],"This research was funded by an NSERC Discovery Grant (#400675), and in partnership with the Ontario Ministry of Transportation Grant (#050235).",,53,6,6,0,5,MDPI,BASEL,"ST ALBAN-ANLAGE 66, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND",,2073-4441,,WATER-SUI,Water,SEP,2020,12,9,,,,,,,2568,10.3390/w12092568,,,16,Environmental Sciences; Water Resources,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),Environmental Sciences & Ecology; Water Resources,OF6RJ,WOS:000581331900001,,gold,,,2022-02-17

However, traditional computational models like hydrologic models need many data about the catchment itself. Sometimes these important data on catchments are not available due to many reasons. Therefore, artificial neural networks (ANNs) are useful soft computing tools in predicting real-world scenarios, such as forecasting future water availability from a catchment, in the absence of intensive data, which are required for modeling practices in the context of hydrology. These ANNs are capable of building relationships to nonlinear real-world problems using available data and then to use that built relationship to forecast future needs. Even though Sri Lanka has an extensive usage of water resources for many activities, including drinking water supply, irrigation, hydropower development, navigation, and many other recreational purposes, forecasting studies for water resources are not being carried out. Therefore, there is a significant gap in forecasting water availability and water needs in the context of Sri Lanka. Thus, this paper presents an artificial neural network model to forecast the inflows of one of the most important reservoirs in northern Sri Lanka using the upstream catchment's rainfall. Future rainfall data are extracted using regional climate models for the years 2021-2050 and the inflows of the reservoir are forecasted using the validated neural network model. Several training algorithms including Levenberg-Marquardt (LM), BFGS quasi-Newton (BFG), scaled conjugate gradient (SCG) have been used to find the best fitting training algorithm to the prediction process of the inflows against the measured inflows. Results revealed that the LM training algorithm outperforms the other tests algorithm in developing the prediction model. In addition, the forecasted results using the projected climate scenarios clearly showcase the benefit of using the forecasting model in solving future water resource management to avoid or to minimize future water scarcity. Therefore, the validated model can effectively be used for proper planning of the proposed drinking water supply scheme to the nearby urban city, Jaffna in northern Sri Lanka.","[Karunanayake, Chamaka; Gunathilake, Miyuru B.; Rathnayake, Upaka] Sri Lanka Inst Informat Technol, Fac Engn, Dept Civil Engn, Malabe, Sri Lanka",,"Rathnayake, U (corresponding author), Sri Lanka Inst Informat Technol, Fac Engn, Dept Civil Engn, Malabe, Sri Lanka.",chamakakarunanayake@gmail.com; miyurubandaragunathilake@gmail.com; upakasanjeewa@gmail.com,"Rathnayake, Upaka/ABB-9627-2021","Gunathilake, Miyuru/0000-0001-7052-1942; Karunanayake, Chamaka/0000-0001-7934-0099; Rathnayake, Upaka/0000-0002-7341-9078",,,,81,2,2,3,4,HINDAWI LTD,LONDON,"ADAM HOUSE, 3RD FLR, 1 FITZROY SQ, LONDON, W1T 5HF, ENGLAND",1687-9724,1687-9732,,APPL COMPUT INTELL S,Appl.

However, it is difficult to find hydrologic data for North Korea, and direct observations of the nation's hydrology are practically impossible to make. Therefore, because of the difficulties in collecting hydrological data, studies on climate change and hydrology in North Korea are rarely conducted. This study collected precipitation and temperature data from 27 weather stations located in North Korea (provided by the World Meteorological Organization), and used the RCP8.5 climate change scenario of the Korean Meteorological Administration to calculate potential future evapotranspiration for each station. The study applied a lumped conceptual model (Water And Snow Balance MODeling system (WASMOD)) to North Korea's representative river basins (Daedong River, Aprok River) to obtain a supplementary hydrologic data time series through doing calculations based on the calculated time series data of the future hydrologic cycle components of North Korea.

Despite the recent advances in hydrometeorological prediction, real-time streamflow forecasting over the Himalayas remains a critical issue and challenge, especially with complex basin physiography, shifting weather patterns and sparse and biased in-situ hydrometeorological monitoring data. In this study, we demonstrate the utility of low-complexity data-driven persistence-based approaches for skillful streamflow forecasting in the Himalayan country Nepal. The selected approaches are: (1) simple persistence, (2) streamflow climatology and (3) anomaly persistence. We generated the streamflow forecasts for 65 stream gauge stations across Nepal for short-to-medium range forecast lead times (1 to 12 days). The selected gauge stations were monitored by the Department of Hydrology and Meteorology (DHM) Nepal, and they represent a wide range of basin size, from similar to 17 to similar to 54,100 km(2). We find that the performance of persistence-based forecasting approaches depends highly upon the lead time, flow threshold, basin size and flow regime. Overall, the persistence-based forecast results demonstrate higher forecast skill in snow-fed rivers over intermittent ones, moderate flows over extreme ones and larger basins over smaller ones. The streamflow forecast skill obtained in this study can serve as a benchmark (reference) for the evaluation of many operational forecasting systems over the Himalayas.","[Ghimire, Ganesh R.] Univ Iowa, IIHR Hydrosci & Engn, Iowa City, IA 52242 USA; [Sharma, Sanjib] Penn State Univ, Earth & Environm Syst Inst, University Pk, PA 16801 USA; [Panthi, Jeeban] Univ Rhode Isl, Dept Geosci, Kingston, RI 02881 USA; [Talchabhadel, Rocky] Kyoto Univ, Disaster Prevent Res Inst, Fushimi Ku, Kyoto 6128235, Japan; [Parajuli, Binod] Minist Energy Water Resources & Irrigat, Dept Hydrol & Meteorol, Kathmandu 44600, Nepal; [Dahal, Piyush] Small Earth Nepal, Kathmandu 44600, Nepal; [Baniya, Rupesh] Tribhuvan Univ, Inst Engn, Pulchowk Campus, Lalitpur 44700, Nepal",,"Ghimire, GR (corresponding author), Univ Iowa, IIHR Hydrosci & Engn, Iowa City, IA 52242 USA.",ganeshghimire1986@gmail.com; sanjibsharma66@gmail.com; Panthijeeban@gmail.com; rocky.ioe@gmail.com; binodparaj@gmail.com; piyush.dahal@gmail.com; rupesh.baniya480@gmail.com,"; Talchabhadel, Rocky/AAC-3420-2019","Panthi, Jeeban/0000-0002-9410-8244; Ghimire, Ganesh R./0000-0002-4284-3941; Talchabhadel, Rocky/0000-0003-0526-7663",,,,44,2,2,0,0,MDPI,BASEL,"ST ALBAN-ANLAGE 66, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND",,2571-9394,,FORECASTING-BASEL,Forecasting,SEP,2020,2,3,,,,,230,247,,10.3390/forecast2030013,,,18,Multidisciplinary Sciences,Emerging Sources Citation Index (ESCI),Science & Technology - Other Topics,UU4OB,WOS:000698780700003,,"Green Published, gold",,,2022-02-17

The hydrologic model is forced with an ensemble of high-resolution climate projections from the Weather Research and Forecasting (WRF) model. The latter has been extended with an interactive lake model (FLake) to capture the effect of the Great Lakes on the regional climate. The WRF ensemble encompasses two different moist physics configurations at resolutions of 90, 30, and 10km, as well as four different initial and boundary conditions, so as to control for natural climate variability. The integrated hydrologic model is run with a representative seasonal cycle, which effectively controls natural climate variability, while remaining computationally tractable with a large integrated model. However, the range of natural variability is also investigated, as are the impacts of climate model resolution and bias correction. The two WRF configurations show opposite climate change responses in summer precipitation, but similar responses otherwise. The hydrologic simulations generally follow the climate forcing; however, due to the memory of the subsurface, the differences in summer propagate throughout the entire seasonal cycle. This results in a set of dry scenarios with reduced streamflow and water availability year-round and a set of wet scenarios with increased streamflow for all times excluding the spring peak, which does not increase. Most of the analysis focuses on streamflow, but changes in the seasonal cycle of baseflow and groundwater recharge are also analyzed. Plain Language Summary In this study we investigate the impact of climate change on water resources using state-of-the-art computer simulations. The simulations were conducted using physically based models, which simulate the circulation of the atmosphere, rainfall, and the flow of water above and below the surface. The region of interest here is the Grand River Watershed, located in the Great Lakes region (southern Ontario, Canada). We show that with high resolution and a physical representation of the Great Lakes, only a simple correctionmuch less than for global climate modelsis necessary, in order to simulate a realistic climate. We find that predicted climate change impacts on water resources depend strongly on some approximations commonly made to represent thunderstorms and precipitation in climate models. The most likely scenario, based on our analysis, is an increase in precipitation and streamflow in all seasons except spring, but some scenarios also show less precipitation in summer, which results in lower streamflow year-round. A major result is that differences in summer precipitation can affect streamflow in all seasons, but only if the interaction with groundwater is properly accounted for. At the moment uncertainty in future summer precipitation changes limits our ability to predict impacts on water resources.","[Erler, Andre R.; Frey, Steven K.; Khader, Omar; Park, Young-Jin; Hwang, Hyoun-Tae; Sudicky, Edward A.] Aquanty, Waterloo, ON, Canada; [Erler, Andre R.; d'Orgeville, Marc; Peltier, W.

Physical models, ensemble streamflow prediction (ESP), do not have skill beyond interannual time scales. However, Global Climate Models have good skill in projecting decadal temperatures. This, combined with the sensitivity of CRB flows to temperature from recent studies, motivate the research question, can skill in decadal temperature projections be translated to operationally skillful flow projections and consequently, water resources management? To explore this, we used temperature projections from the Community Earth System Model-Decadal Prediction Large Ensemble (CESM-DPLE) along with past basin runoff efficiency as covariates in a Random Forest (RF) method to project ensembles of multiyear mean flow at the key aggregate gauge of Lees Ferry, Arizona. RF streamflow projections outperformed both ESP and climatology in a 1982-2017 hindcast, as measured by ranked probability skill score. The projections were disaggregated to monthly and subbasin scales to drive the Colorado River Mid-term Modeling System (CRMMS) to generate ensembles of water management variables. The projections of pool elevations in Lakes Powell and Mead, the two largest U.S. reservoirs that are critical for water resources management in the basin, were found to reduce the hindcast median root mean square error by up to -20% and -30% at lead times of 48 and 60 months, respectively, relative to projections generated from ESP. This suggests opportunities for enhancing water resources management in the CRB and potentially elsewhere.","[Woodson, David; Rajagopalan, Balaji] Univ Colorado, Dept Civil Environm & Architectural Engn, Boulder, CO 80309 USA; [Rajagopalan, Balaji] Cooperat Inst Res Environm Sci, Boulder, CO USA; [Baker, Sarah; Smith, Rebecca; Prairie, James] US Bur Reclamat, Boulder, CO USA; [Towler, Erin; Ge, Ming] Natl Ctr Atmospher Res, POB 3000, Boulder, CO 80307 USA; [Zagona, Edith] Univ Colorado, Ctr Adv Decis Support Water & Environm Syst CADSW, Boulder, CO 80309 USA",,"Woodson, D (corresponding author), Univ Colorado, Dept Civil Environm & Architectural Engn, Boulder, CO 80309 USA.",david.woodson@colorado.edu,"; Rajagopalan, Balaji/A-5383-2013","Woodson, David/0000-0001-9852-5355; ZAGONA, EDITH/0000-0003-1333-0589; Towler, Erin/0000-0002-1784-1346; Rajagopalan, Balaji/0000-0002-6883-7240",USBR (Science & Technology grant) [19264]; CU-Boulder CEAE; Central Arizona Water Conservation District; Denver Water; California's Six Agency Committee; Southern Nevada Water Authority; National Center for Atmospheric Research (NCAR) - National Science Foundation (NSF) [1852977],"David Woodson and Dr Balaji Rajagopalan would like to thank the USBR (Science & Technology grant #19264) and CU-Boulder CEAE for research funding.

Regional hydrology and the downstream water flow in the rivers of Himalayan origin may change due to variations in snow and glacier melt in the region. This study examines the mid-21st century climate projections over western Himalayas from the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project Phase 5 (CMIP5) global climate models under Representative Concentration Pathways (RCP) scenarios (RCP4.5 and RCP8.5). All the global climate models used in the present analysis indicate that the study region would be warmer by mid-century. The temperature trends from all the models studied here are statistically significant at 95% confidence interval. Multi-model ensemble spreads show that there are large differences among the models in their projections of future climate with spread in temperature ranging from about 1.5 degrees C to 5 degrees C over various areas of western Himalayas in all the seasons. Spread in precipitation projections lies between 0.3 and 1 mm/day in all the seasons. Major shift in the timing of evaporation maxima and minima is noticed. The GFDL_ESM2G model products have been downscaled to Satluj River basin using the weather research and forecast (WRF) model and impact of climate change on streamflow has been studied. The reduction of precipitation during JJAS is expected to be > 3-6 mm/day in RCP8.5 as compared to present climate. It is expected that precipitation amount shall increase over Satluj basin in future (mid-21st century) The soil and water assessment tool (SWAT) model has been used to simulate the Satluj streamflow for the present and future climate using GFDL_ESM2G precipitation and temperature data as well as the WRF model downscaled data. The computations using the global model data show that total annual discharge from Satluj will be less in future than that in present climate, especially in peak discharge season (JJAS). The SWAT model with downscaled output indicates that during winter and spring, more discharge shall occur in future (RCP8.5) in Satluj River.","[Tiwari, Sarita; Kar, Sarat C.] Natl Ctr Medium Range Weather Forecasting, A-50,Sect 62, Noida, India; [Tiwari, Sarita; Bhatla, R.] Banaras Hindu Univ, Dept Geophys, Varanasi, Uttar Pradesh, India",,"Kar, SC (corresponding author), Natl Ctr Medium Range Weather Forecasting, A-50,Sect 62, Noida, India.",sckar@nanrwf.gov.in,,"Bhatla, R/0000-0002-8031-8857",,,,57,7,7,1,19,ELSEVIER,AMSTERDAM,"RADARWEG 29, 1043 NX AMSTERDAM, NETHERLANDS",0921-8181,1872-6364,,GLOBAL PLANET CHANGE,Glob.

Reservoir operations for each member of an ESP are individually modeled to forecast system conditions and calculate risk of reaching critical operational thresholds. Reservoir release decisions are simulated to manage forecasted risk with respect to established risk tolerance levels. EFO was developed for Lake Mendocino, a 111,000 acre-foot reservoir near Ukiah, California, to evaluate its viability to improve reservoir storage reliability without increasing downstream flood risk. Lake Mendocino is a dual use reservoir, owned and operated for flood control by the United States Army Corps of Engineers and operated for water supply by Sonoma Water. EFO was simulated using a 26-year (1985-2010) ESP hindcast generated by the California-Nevada River Forecast Center, which provides 61-member ensembles of 15-day flow forecasts. EFO simulations yield generally higher storage levels during the flood management season while maintaining needed flood storage capacity by strategically prereleasing water in advance of forecasted storms. Model results demonstrate a 33% increase in median storage at the end of the flood management season (10 May) over existing operations without marked changes in flood frequency for locations downstream from Lake Mendocino.

In this study, our aim is to identify knowledge gaps, monitoring assessment objectives, and management recommendations that should be critically reviewed through the iterative monitoring-modelling-assessment cycles of adaptive management. In the watershed, the presence of multiple SWAT applications provides assurance that a wide array of physical, chemical, and biological processes with distinct characterizations are used to reproduce the patterns of flow and nutrient export in agricultural lands. While there are models with more advanced mechanistic representation of certain facets of the hydrological cycle (surface runoff, groundwater and sediment erosion) or better equipped to depict urban settings, we believe that greater insights will be gained by revisiting several influential assumptions (tile drainage, fertilizer/manure application rates, land-use/landcover data) and recalibrating the existing SWAT models to capture both baseline and event-flow conditions and daily nutrient concentration (not loading) variability in multiple locations rather than a single downstream site. It is also critical to redesign land-use management scenarios by accommodating recent conceptual and technical advancements of their life-cycle effectiveness, the variability in their starting operational efficiency, and differential response to storm events or seasonality, as well as the role of legacy phosphorus. In the receiving waterbody, the development of data-driven models to establish causal linkages between the trophic status of Lake Erie and external phosphorus loading represents a pragmatic means to draw forecasts regarding the phyto-plankton community response to different management actions. Two critical next steps to further augment the empirical modelling work is the iterative updating as more data are acquired through monitoring and the introduction of additional explanatory variables that are likely associated with the occurrence of cyanobacteria-dominated blooms. The majority of the process-based models are not constrained by the available data, and therefore their primary value is their use as heuristic tools to advance our understanding of Lake Erie. The validation of their predictive power should become one of the overarching objectives of the iterative monitoring-modelling-assessment cycles. With respect to the projected responses of the system to nutrient loading reduction, we express our skepticism with the optimistic predictions of the extent and duration of hypoxia, given our limited knowledge of the sediment diagenesis processes in the central basin along with the lack of data related to the vertical profiles of organic matter and phosphorus fractionation or sedimentation/burial rates. Our study also questions the adequacy of the coarse spatiotemporal (seasonal/annual, basin- or lake-wide) scales characterizing the philosophy of both water quality management objectives and modelling enterprise in Lake Erie, as this strategy seems somewhat disconnected from the ecosystem services targeted. We conclude by emphasizing that the valuation of ecosystem services should be integrated into the decision-making process, as we track the evolution of the system over time.","[Arhonditsis, George B.; Neumann, Alex; Shimoda, Yuko; Kim, Dong-Kyun; Dong, Feifei; Onandia, Gabriela; Yang, Cindy; Javed, Aisha; Brady, Meghan; Visha, Ariola; Ni, Felicity; Cheng, Vincent] Univ Toronto, Dept Phys & Environm Sci, Ecol Modelling Lab, Toronto, ON M1C 1A4, Canada",,"Arhonditsis, GB (corresponding author), Univ Toronto, Dept Phys & Environm Sci, Ecol Modelling Lab, Toronto, ON M1C 1A4, Canada.",georgea@utsc.utoronto.ca,"Arhonditsis, George B/C-6980-2009; Dong, Feifei/AAW-7470-2020; Arhonditsis, George/AAI-7897-2020","Dong, Feifei/0000-0003-1241-1563; Arhonditsis, George/0000-0001-5359-8737; Neumann, Alex/0000-0003-1590-8516; Javed, Aisha/0000-0002-8516-6370",International Joint Commission [1042700743],"This project has received funding support from the International Joint Commission (Requisition Number 1042700743).

MPC can manage the water system in a holistic manner and has a flexible structure to incorporate specific elements, such as setpoints and constraints. Therefore, MPC has shown its versatile performance in many branches of WRM. Nonetheless, with the in-depth understanding of stochastic hydrology in recent studies, MPC also faces the challenge of how to cope with hydrological uncertainty in its decision-making process. A possible way to embed the uncertainty is to generate an Ensemble Forecast (EF) of hydrological variables, rather than a deterministic one. The combination of MPC and EF results in a more comprehensive approach: Multi-scenario MPC (MS-MPC). In this study, we will first assess the model performance of MS-MPC, considering an ensemble streamflow forecast. Noticeably, the computational inefficiency may be a critical obstacle that hinders applicability of MS-MPC. In fact, with more scenarios taken into account, the computational burden of solving an optimization problem in MS-MPC accordingly increases. To deal with this challenge, we propose the Adaptive Control Resolution (ACR) approach as a computationally efficient scheme to practically reduce the number of control variables in MS-MPC. In brief, the ACR approach uses a mixed-resolution control time step from the near future to the distant future. The ACR-MPC approach is tested on a real-world case study: an integrated flood control and navigation problem in the North Sea Canal of the Netherlands. Such an approach reduces the computation time by 18% and up in our case study. At the same time, the model performance of ACR-MPC remains close to that of conventional MPC. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd.

Researchers have explored the impact of HABs on local economies, but know relatively little about the decision making that informs these behaviors that lead to financial losses. Understanding the factors that inform this decision-making is critical to developing mitigative solutions. This study seeks to understand how HABs in Western Lake Erie affect angler decision-making, before evaluating a possible decision-support tool a harmful algal bloom forecast known as the Experimental Lake Erie HAB Tracker. The HAB Tracker provides a nowcast and five-day forecast of the spatial distribution and transport of Microcystis, the predominant species of harmful algae in Western Lake Erie. Data collected using focus groups and surveys were coded to identify key themes that influence angler decision-making. The theory of the diffusion of innovations provides an analytical framework to evaluate the potential for widespread adoption of the HAB forecast among Lake Erie anglers. Analysis of emerging themes revealed that Lake Erie anglers face three key decision-points when fishing in HABs: whether to fish, where to fish, and whether to eat the fish. Five primary variables factored into angler decisions on where and whether to fish including 1) perceptions of HAB aesthetics, 2) perceptions of the impact of HABs on angler health, 3) perceptions of the impact of HABs on fish, 4) communication methods, 5) perceptions of HABs by customers of charter captains. Most participants in this study sought to avoid fishing in HABs primarily for aesthetic reasons. Recreational anglers are more likely than charter captains to adopt the HAS Tracker as a decision-support tool, because it is compatible with their information needs and provides a relative advantage over existing sources of information. Charter captains are less likely to adopt the HAB Tracker, because they rely on their existing knowledge and social network for HAB information. If researchers can reduce the complexity of forecast information while increasing its accessibility and reliability, then all anglers will be more likely to adopt a HAS forecast as a decision-support tool while fishing in Lake Erie during bloom season.","[Gill, Devin; Rowe, Mark] Univ Michigan, CIGLR, 4840 S State Rd, Ann Arbor, MI 48108 USA; [Joshi, Sonia Joseph] Univ Michigan, Sch Environm & Sustainabil, 440 Church St, Ann Arbor, MI 48109 USA",,"Gill, D (corresponding author), Univ Michigan, CIGLR, 4840 S State Rd, Ann Arbor, MI 48108 USA.",deving@umich.edu; mdrowe@umich.edu; soniajos@umich.edu,,"Rowe, Mark/0000-0002-0852-3346; Gill, Devin/0000-0001-5062-7969","Cooperative Institute for Great Lakes Research (CIGLR) through the NOAA; University of Michigan, USAUniversity of Michigan System [NA12OAR4320071]","This work was funded by the Cooperative Institute for Great Lakes Research (CIGLR) through the NOAA Cooperative Agreement with the University of Michigan, USA (NA12OAR4320071).

Answers to these questions are somewhat unclear but critical for designing ecological management strategies. Here we forecast potential impacts of climate change on freshwater lake fish communities of Ontario, Canada, by contrasting species composition, species richness, functional diversity and functional composition for present versus projected communities under best-case and business-as-usual climate change scenarios. Results indicate that the composition of projected communities differs from present, and includes a shift from cold- and cool-water species to warm-water species. Species richness in projected communities is estimated to increase by 60-81%, but functional diversity is estimated to decline. These projected communities are estimated to have on average 22% shorter mean body length, 38% lighter body weight and 36% less fecundity than present. Also, the present configuration of sport and commercially important fishes are projected to decline in their distribution, potentially impacting ecosystem services associated with commercial and recreational fisheries. Together, climate change may initiate a compositional shift that may result in an important shift in community functional structure, which is likely to affect important aquatic ecosystem services.","[Biswas, Shekhar R.; Sharma, Sapna] York Univ, Dept Biol, 4700 Keele St, Toronto, ON M3J 1P3, Canada; [Biswas, Shekhar R.] Lakehead Univ, Fac Nat Resources Management, 955 Oliver Rd, Thunder Bay, ON P7B 5E1, Canada; [Vogt, Richard J.] Univ Quebec, Dept Biol Sci, CP 8888,Succ Ctr Ville, Montreal, PQ H3C 3P8, Canada",,"Biswas, SR (corresponding author), Lakehead Univ, Fac Nat Resources Management, 955 Oliver Rd, Thunder Bay, ON P7B 5E1, Canada.",shekhar.forest@gmail.com,,"Biswas, Shekhar/0000-0001-9203-2488; Sharma, Sapna/0000-0003-4571-2768",Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council CanadaNatural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada (NSERC); York University,"We thank Ontario Ministry of Natural Resources for the fish data; Thomas Van Zuiden and Miranda Chen for the climate data; Saiful Khan for the map of the study area; and John Magnuson, Begona Santos and two anonymous reviewers for valuable comments on an earlier version of this manuscript.

In order to maintain reliable water supplies, reservoir operation and water resource management, accurate streamflow forecasts are very important. Based on monthly flow data from five hydrological stations in the middle and lower parts of the Hanjiang River Basin, between 1989 and 2009, we consider an efficient approach of adopting the gene expression programming model based on wavelet decomposition and de-noising (WDDGEP) to forecast river flow. Original flow time series data are initially decomposed into one sub-signal approximation and seven sub-signal details using the dmey wavelet. A wavelet threshold de-noising method is also applied in this study. Data that have been de-noised after decomposition are then adopted as inputs for WDDGEP models. Finally, the forecasted sub-signal results are summed to formulate an ensemble forecast for the original monthly flow series. A comparison of the prediction accuracy between the two models is based on three performance evaluation measures. Results show that the new WDDGEP models can effectively enhance accuracy in forecasting streamflow, and the proposed wavelet-based de-noising of the observed non-stationary time series is an effective measure to improve simulation accuracy.","[Lu, Xiaorong; Wang, Xuelei; Zhang, Liang; Yang, Chao; Song, XinXin] Chinese Acad Sci, Inst Geodesy & Geophys, Wuhan 430077, Hubei, Peoples R China; [Lu, Xiaorong; Wang, Xuelei; Zhang, Liang; Yang, Chao; Song, XinXin] Key Lab Environm & Disaster Monitoring & Evaluat, Wuhan 430077, Hubei, Peoples R China; [Lu, Xiaorong; Zhang, Ting; Yang, Chao; Song, XinXin] Univ Chinese Acad Sci, Beijing 100049, Peoples R China; [Yang, Qing] Key Lab Pollut Ecol & Environm Engn, Shenyang 110016, Liaoning, Peoples R China; [Zhang, Ting] Hubei Univ Sci & Technol, Sch Resource & Environm Sci & Engn, Xianning 437100, Hubei, Peoples R China",,"Wang, XL (corresponding author), Chinese Acad Sci, Inst Geodesy & Geophys, Wuhan 430077, Hubei, Peoples R China.; Wang, XL (corresponding author), Key Lab Environm & Disaster Monitoring & Evaluat, Wuhan 430077, Hubei, Peoples R China.",xueleiwang@whigg.ac.cn,,,"National Natural Science Foundation of ChinaNational Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC) [41571202, 41171426]; Key Program of Institute of Geodesy and Geophysics, Chinese Academy of Sciences; Natural Science Foundation of Hubei Province, ChinaNatural Science Foundation of Hubei Province [2014CFB330]","This work was supported by: (1) the National Natural Science Foundation of China (Grant No. 41571202, 41171426); (2) the Key Program of Institute of Geodesy and Geophysics, Chinese Academy of Sciences; and (3) the Natural Science Foundation of Hubei Province, China (Project No. 2014CFB330).",,31,7,7,1,7,IWA PUBLISHING,LONDON,"ALLIANCE HOUSE, 12 CAXTON ST, LONDON SW1H0QS, ENGLAND",1998-9563,2224-7955,,HYDROL RES,Hydrol.

However, it remains an enormous challenge to produce forecasts of water quality variables that are accurate enough to meet public demand. In this study, we developed and evaluated a new forecast framework for real-time forecasting of daily dissolved oxygen (DO), ammonium nitrogen (NH), total phosphorus (TP) and total nitrogen (TN) concentrations at lead times from one to six days for Lake Chaohu, the fifth largest freshwater lake in China. The forecast framework is based on a 3-D hydrodynamic ecological model referred to as EcoLake. We used hydrological, meteorological and water quality data from multiple sources to generate initial conditions and forcing functions. Solar radiation and inflows from tributaries which are not readily available were calculated using forecasted cloud cover and rainfall. Forecast skill was evaluated based on 122 forecasts produced on different days in 2017 and for each of the 12 sampling sites. Results indicate that the skill of the forecast framework varies considerably across water quality variables, sampling sites, and lead times. Generally, the forecast framework is more skillful than the persistence forecasts, which use the most recent observations as forecasts. The TN forecasts tend to be the most skillful with a mean RMSE skill score of 28.5% averaged across the six lead times. The DO forecasts tend to have the lowest skill with an average value of 10.9%. Model sensitivity experiments further revealed that errors in the raw air temperature and wind speed forecasts have a noticeable impact on the overall skill of DO and NH forecasts. The forecast framework proposed here could be a useful operational forecasting tool to enhance the effectiveness of the drinking water supply and public health protection based on the water quality management of Lake Chaohu.

In recent years niche-based models (NBMs) have been used to predict species distribution and are an important tool for conservation and management of aquatic ecosystems. In this work, the current and future climatic suitability areas of the invasive species Corbicula fluminea, which has known adverse ecological and economic impacts, were investigated. The species distribution modelling was based on nine algorithms in BIOMOD2, summarized in an ensemble forecasting approach. To model the species distribution, eight climatic parameters related to temperature and precipitation variables were considered. Three time frames (current, 2050 and 2070) were modelled using four increasing CO2 emission scenarios. The performance of individual models was excellent according to the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) and good to excellent according to true skill statistics (TSS). Annual mean temperature, minimum temperature of the coldest month and mean temperature of the coldest quarter were the most important variables predicting C. fluminea occurrence. Of the total continental area, 6.6% was predicted to be suitable for C. fluminea in current conditions. In the future, suitable area will increase from the current value of 6.6% to values from 9.4% to 12.6%, according to the 2050 projections and up to 12.7% in 2070 in high emission scenarios. Overall, the results indicate that climate change will favour the expansion of C. fluminea into new river basins, especially at higher latitudes, and that future climatic scenarios may double the suitable area for Corbicula fluminea.","[Gama, Mafalda; Anastacio, Pedro Manuel] Univ Evora, MARE Marine & Environm Sci Ctr, Evora, Portugal; [Crespo, Daniel] Univ Coimbra, CFE, Coimbra, Portugal; [Dolbeth, Marina] Univ Porto, Interdisciplinary Ctr Marine & Environm Res, CIIMAR, Oporto, Portugal",,"Gama, M (corresponding author), Univ Evora, Escola Ciencias & Tecnol, Dept Paisagem Ambiente & Ordenamento, Colegio Luis Antonio Verney, Rua Romao Ramalho 59, P-7000 Evora, Portugal.",ana.gama@ci.uc.pt,"Anastácio, Pedro/B-4716-2008; Dolbeth, Marina/AAF-7501-2019; de Jesus Andrade e Crespo, Daniel/O-2627-2017; Dolbeth, Marina/I-3840-2013; CIIMAR, BYT/N-6498-2017","Anastácio, Pedro/0000-0003-1808-3847; Dolbeth, Marina/0000-0002-8775-0351; de Jesus Andrade e Crespo, Daniel/0000-0003-4402-5229; Dolbeth, Marina/0000-0002-8775-0351; CIIMAR, BYT/0000-0002-3703-4402; Gama, Mafalda/0000-0001-8682-1923","Programa Operacional de Factores de Competitividade - COMPETE; FCT - Fundacao para a Ciencia e TecnologiaPortuguese Foundation for Science and Technology [SFRH/BD/80252/2011.post-doc, SFRH/BPD/41117/2007]; Fundacao para a Ciencia e Tecnologia (FCT)Portuguese Foundation for Science and TechnologyEuropean Commission [UID/MAR/04292/2013]","Programa Operacional de Factores de Competitividade - COMPETE; FCT - Fundacao para a Ciencia e Tecnologia, Grant/Award Number: SFRH/BD/80252/2011.post-doc, Grant/Award Number: SFRH/BPD/41117/2007.

Climate change induced alteration of the hydrological cycle is one of the main threats to future accessibility of water resources. Effective prediction of possible impacts of climate change on groundwater reserves, a crucial water resource, could be of great importance for sustainable water management. In a comparative study, artificial neural network (ANN), least square support vector machine (LSSVM), and nonlinear autoregressive network with exogenous inputs (NARX) models was applied to evaluate possible impacts of three representative concentration pathways (RCP) climate change scenarios (RCP2.6, RCP4.5, RCP8.5) on groundwater levels in Tasuj Plain, Iran. Four general circulation models (GCM) was used to predict temperature and precipitation values for the future period 2022-2050 and found that future temperature increased, while the amount of precipitation decreased. To improve the accuracy of three models in groundwater level prediction, db4 wavelet transform was applied. The results indicated that the Wavelet-NARX approach gave the best accuracy in forecasting groundwater level in the study area. In all cases, prediction indicated that groundwater level in all representative wells would decline in future.","[Ghazi, Babak; Jeihouni, Esmaeil] Islamic Azad Univ, Dept Civil Engn, Sofian Branch, Sofian, Iran; [Kalantari, Zahra] Stockholm Univ, Dept Phys Geog, Stockholm, Sweden; [Kalantari, Zahra] Stockholm Univ, Bolin Ctr Climate Res, Stockholm, Sweden",,"Ghazi, B (corresponding author), Islamic Azad Univ, Dept Civil Engn, Sofian Branch, Sofian, Iran.",Babak.ghazi1986@gmail.com,"Kalantari, Zahra/ABG-6635-2020; Ghazi, Babak/AAS-2453-2020; Jeihouni, Esmaeil/AAN-5044-2021","Kalantari, Zahra/0000-0002-7978-0040; Ghazi, Babak/0000-0002-3311-0228; Jeihouni, Esmaeil/0000-0002-4399-7694",,,,76,3,3,4,6,SPRINGER HEIDELBERG,HEIDELBERG,"TIERGARTENSTRASSE 17, D-69121 HEIDELBERG, GERMANY",1866-7511,1866-7538,,ARAB J GEOSCI,Arab.

Decision-support systems, composed of a hydrological forecasting system and a reservoir model, can ensure that reservoir operation objectives are attained more effectively than by relying solely on expert judgment. In this study, a simple ensemble inflow forecasting system coupled with a reservoir model is developed and the proposed model-based operational water management decisions are compared with those based on expert judgment for the Shipshaw River in Quebec, Canada. Given that no natural streamflow records are available for the Shipshaw River, the HEC-HMS hydrological model is calibrated using a regionalization method based on physical similarity. The calibrated hydrological model is fed by ensemble meteorological forecasts that include 20 members, with a 10-day horizon and a 6-hour time step. The proposed decision-support system can help avoid small flooding events while potentially improving energy production by 2 to 60% for this case study. The proposed forecasting system also allows water-resource managers to anticipate events with a greater lead time.","[Reig, Estelle; Boucher, Marie-Amelie] Univ Sherbrooke, Dept Civil & Bldg Engn, Sherbrooke, PQ, Canada; [Tremblay, Eric] Resolute Forest Prod, Hydrosaguenay, Saguenay, PQ, Canada",,"Reig, E (corresponding author), Univ Sherbrooke, Dept Civil & Bldg Engn, Sherbrooke, PQ, Canada.",estelle.reig@gmail.com,,"Boucher, Marie-Amelie/0000-0002-4246-2444",,,,73,0,0,1,5,TAYLOR & FRANCIS INC,PHILADELPHIA,"530 WALNUT STREET, STE 850, PHILADELPHIA, PA 19106 USA",0701-1784,1918-1817,,CAN WATER RESOUR J,Can.

Its floodplain eco-system, which is strongly tied to seasonal flood pulse, is extremely important for food security, trade and economy of Cambodia, supporting the livelihoods of about 1.7 million people. On the other hand, flood can also be extremely devastating in the region along the TSL. In recent years, studies have pointed out that rapid growing number of water infrastructures as well as future climate changes may alter the hydrological cycle of the Mekong River Basin (MRB) and are expected to influence the flood pulse of the TSL and surrounding TSL floodplain. Therefore, it is timely to understand historical inundation extent and predict its likely future state. In this study, we proposed a Rotated Empirical Orthogonal Function (REOF) analysis-based daily inundation extent estimation framework, integrating multi-temporal stack of Sentinel-1A Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) imagery and Jason-series satellite altimetry data. The framework can generate daily, cloud-free and gap-free inundation extents for any given time depending on the altimetry data provided. A long-term El Nino and Southern Oscillation (ENSO) index-based daily TSL level forecasting method with months of lead time was also proposed to fulfill the framework's forecasting capacity. In this study, the framework was adopted in the TSL floodplain area for hindcast (2003 to 2015) and forecast (January to July 2019) of daily inundation extents. Estimated inundation extents were cross-compared with MODIS-derived and Sentinel-1-derived inundation maps, resulting in up to higher than 90% of Critical Success Index (CSI). The proposed framework has (1) innovative capacity of estimation of future daily areal inundation extents and is (2) a fully remote sensing-based framework which can empower local authorities tasked with water resource management decisions without relying on upstream countries. The framework has potential to be implemented in other major river basins or wetlands (e.g., Amazon River Basin, and Congo River Basin). The implementation on SAR imagery from other satellites with different bands of electromagnetic wave is also possible but requires more investigation.","[Chang, Chi-Hung; Lee, Hyongki; Kim, Donghwan] Univ Houston, Dept Civil & Environm Engn, 5000 Gulf Fwy,Bldg 4,Rm 216, Houston, TX 77204 USA; [Kim, Donghwan] Joint Forces Mil Univ, Dept Mil Strategy, Daejeon 34059, South Korea; [Hwang, Euiho] K Water Inst, Water Resources Res Ctr, 200 Sintanjin Ro, Daejeon 34350, South Korea; [Hossain, Faisal] Univ Washington, Dept Civil & Environm Engn, Wilcox Hall 167,2117 Mason Rd, Seattle, WA 98195 USA; [Chishtie, Farrukh; Jayasinghe, Susantha; Basnayake, Senaka] Asian Disaster Preparedness Ctr, SM Tower,24th Floor,979-69 Paholyothin Rd, Bangkok 10400, Thailand; [Chishtie, Farrukh] Spatial Informat Grp LLC, 2529 Yolanda Ct, Pleasanton, CA 94566 USA",,"Lee, H (corresponding author), Univ Houston, Dept Civil & Environm Engn, 5000 Gulf Fwy,Bldg 4,Rm 216, Houston, TX 77204 USA.",cchang21@uh.edu; hlee@uh.edu; donghwan.kma@gmail.com; ehhwang@kwater.or.kr; fhossain@uw.edu; Farrukh.chishtie@adpc.net; susantha@adpc.net; senaka_basnayake@adpc.net,"Lee, Hyongki/AAD-5210-2021","Lee, Hyongki/0000-0001-6478-7533; , Donghwan/0000-0002-9373-0680","NASANational Aeronautics & Space Administration (NASA) [80NSSC18K0423, 80NSSC20K0152]; Ministry of Environment, South Korea, under the Demand Responsive Water Supply Service Program [2019002650004]","This study is partly supported by NASA's Applied Sciences Program for GEOGLOWS (80NSSC18K0423) and SERVIR (80NSSC20K0152), and by the Ministry of Environment, South Korea, under the Demand Responsive Water Supply Service Program (Grant number 2019002650004).

To understand streamflow forecasting predictability, this study considered the three largest rivers in China and explored deterministic and probabilistic skill metrics on the monthly scale according to ensemble streamflow hindcasts from the hydrological model Hydrologiska Byrans Vattenbalansavdelning (HBV) driven by multiple climate forcings from the climate system model by the Beijing Climate Center (BCC_CSM1.1m). The effects of initial conditions (ICs) and meteorological forcings (MFs) on skill were investigated using the conventional ensemble streamflow prediction (ESP) and reverse-ESP (revESP). The results revealed the following: (1) Skill declines as lead time increases, and forecasting is generally the most skillful for lead month 1; (2) skill is higher for dry rivers than wet rivers, and higher for dry target months than wet months for the Yellow and Yangtze Rivers, suggesting greater skill in potential drought forecasting than flood forecasting; (3) the relative operating characteristic (ROC) area is greater for abnormal terciles than the near-normal tercile for all three rivers, greater for the above-normal tercile than the below-normal tercile for the Yellow and Yangtze Rivers, but slightly greater for the below-normal tercile than the above-normal tercile for the Xijiang River; and (4) the influence of ICs outweighs that of MFs in dry months, and the period of influence varies from 1 to 3 months; however, the influence of MFs is dominant in wet target months. These findings will help improve the understanding of both the seasonal streamflow forecasting predictability based on coupled climate system/hydrological models and of streamflow forecasting for variable rivers and seasons.","[Liu, Lyuliu; Zhang, Peiqun; Zhai, Jianqing; Zhang, Li; Xiao, Chan] China Meteorol Adm, Natl Climate Ctr, Beijing 100081, Peoples R China; [Wu, Ying] China Meteorol Adm, Publ Meteorol Serv Ctr, Beijing 100081, Peoples R China",,"Liu, LL (corresponding author), China Meteorol Adm, Natl Climate Ctr, Beijing 100081, Peoples R China.",liull@cma.gov.cn; wuying@cma.gov.cn; zhangpq@cma.gov.cn; zhaijq@cma.gov.cn; zhangli@cma.gov.cn; xiaochan@cma.gov.cn,,,"National Key Research and Development Program of China; China Meteorological Administration [2018YFE0196000, 2017YFA0605004, GYHY201406021]; UK-China Research and Innovation Partnership Fund through the Met Office Climate Science for Service Partnership (CSSP) China, Newton Fund",This research was funded by [National Key Research and Development Program of China; the Nonprofit Special Scientific Research supported by the China Meteorological Administration] grant number [2018YFE0196000 and 2017YFA0605004; GYHY201406021].

However, with aquifers stressed by overdraft, contamination from land use, and the hydrologic impacts of climate change, identifying reliable sources for new wells is increasingly challenging. Well forecasting is a process in which potential groundwater resources are evaluated for a location of interest. While this process forecasts the depth of each aquifer for a given location, it takes historical groundwater well data from nearby locations into account. Conventionally, well forecasting is done by geological survey professionals by manually analyzing the well data and, that makes the process both time and resource-intensive. This study presents a novel web application that performs well forecasting for any location within the state of Iowa in a matter of seconds utilizing client-side computing instead of expensive professional labor. The web application generates well forecasts by triangulating millions of combinations of historical aquifer depth data of nearby wells stored in a state-level database. The proposed web system also provides water quality information for arsenic, nitrate, and bacteria (total c and fecal coliform) on the same interface with forecasts. The system is open to the public and is aimed to provide a go-to tool for homeowners, well drillers and, authorities to help inform decision-making regarding groundwater well development and water quality monitoring efforts.

For example, if managers received a forecast indicating a high likelihood of impending impairment, they could make decisions today to prevent or mitigate poor water quality in the future. Increasing the number of automated, real-time freshwater forecasts used for management requires integrating interdisciplinary expertise to develop a framework that seamlessly links data, models, and cyberinfrastructure, as well as collaborations with managers to ensure that forecasts are embedded into decision-making workflows. The goal of this study is to advance the implementation of near-term, iterative ecological forecasts for freshwater management. We first provide an overview of FLARE (Forecasting Lake And Reservoir Ecosystems), a forecasting framework we developed and applied to a drinking water reservoir to assist water quality management, as a potential open-source option for interested users. We used FLARE to develop scenario forecasts simulating different water quality interventions to inform manager decision-making. Second, we share lessons learned from our experience developing and running FLARE over 2 years to inform other forecasting projects. We specifically focus on how to develop, implement, and maintain a forecasting system used for active management. Our goal is to break down the barriers to forecasting for freshwater researchers, with the aim of improving lake and reservoir management globally.","[Carey, Cayelan C.; Woelmer, Whitney M.; Lofton, Mary E.; Bookout, Bethany J.; Hounshell, Alexandria G.; Howard, Dexter W.; Lewis, Abigail S.

This study developed an interactive lake-atmosphere-hydrology modeling system by coupling the regional Climate-Weather Research and Forecasting model (CWRF) with the 3-D unstructured-grid Finite Volume Coastal Ocean Model (FVCOM) in the Great Lakes region. The sensitivity of the coupled system, relative to the CWRF baseline using the 1-D Lake, Ice, Snow and Sediment Simulator (LISSS), was evaluated in representing lake-climate conditions during 1999-2015 against observations. As coupled with CWRF, FVCOM outperformed LISSS in simulating water surface temperature, ice cover, and vertical thermal structure at seasonal to interannual scales for all the five lakes and realistically reproduced the regional circulation patterns. In warm seasons, the improved lake conditions significantly corrected LISSS overestimates of surface air temperature together with larger-scale circulation changes. Consequently, precipitation was generally reduced over each lake basin, mainly because of decreased surface moisture and heat fluxes along with enhanced atmospheric stability. Through the dynamic coupling, FVCOM predicts the water level fluctuations in direct response to the CWRF NBS components and connecting channel flows based on a stage-fall-discharge formulation. This coupled CWRF-FVCOM reasonably captured the NBS variations and predicted the water level fluctuations for Lakes Superior and Michigan-Huron. It represents a major advance in interacting regional climate and watershed processes to dynamically predict Great Lakes' water level seasonal-interannual variations. Plain Language Summary Coupling 3-D hydrodynamics with climate models is necessary but difficult for resolving multiscale interactions and has been rarely implemented in predicting Great Lakes' water level fluctuations because of issues in treating net basin supply (NBS) components and connecting channel flows. We developed an interactive lake-atmosphere- hydrology modeling system by coupling the regional Climate-Weather Research and Forecasting model (CWRF) with the 3-D unstructured-grid Finite Volume Coastal Ocean Model (FVCOM) and compared it with the baseline CWRF configured with 1-D lake model to understand how 3-D hydrodynamic processes affect the prediction of the lake and regional climate conditions. The coupled CWRF-FVCOM system significantly improved the simulation of all the five lakes' conditions at seasonal to interannual scales and realistically reproduced the regional circulation patterns. Our analysis also explained the processes that are associated with such sensitivity. Furthermore, as a unique contribution to the literature, we constructed FVCOM to dynamically predict the water level fluctuations in direct response to the coupled CWRF NBS components and connecting channel flows based on a stage-fall-discharge formulation. This coupled CWRF-FVCOM system represents a major advance in interacting regional climate and watershed processes to dynamically predict Great Lakes' water level seasonal-interannual variations.","[Sun, Lei] Nanjing Univ Informat Sci & Technol, Sch Atmospher Sci, Nanjing, Peoples R China; [Sun, Lei; Liang, Xin-Zhong] Univ Maryland, Earth Syst Sci Interdisciplinary Ctr, College Pk, MD 20742 USA; [Liang, Xin-Zhong] Univ Maryland, Dept Atmospher & Ocean Sci, College Pk, MD 20742 USA; [Xia, Meng] Univ Maryland Eastern Shore, Dept Nat Sci, Princess Anne, MD USA",,"Liang, XZ (corresponding author), Univ Maryland, Earth Syst Sci Interdisciplinary Ctr, College Pk, MD 20742 USA.; Liang, XZ (corresponding author), Univ Maryland, Dept Atmospher & Ocean Sci, College Pk, MD 20742 USA.",xliang@umd.edu,,,"U.S. National Science Foundation Innovations at the Nexus of Food, Energy and Water Systems [EAR1639327, EAR1903249]","The research was supported by U.S. National Science Foundation Innovations at the Nexus of Food, Energy and Water Systems under Grants EAR1639327 and EAR1903249.

The complex interactive effects of these environmental factors as well as the resilience of phytoplankton communities further make the prediction of phytoplankton communities' dynamics challenging. In this study, we analyzed multiple environmental factors and their relative importance in predicting both phytoplankton shifting and cyanobacteria abundance in two regulated shallow lakes in central China. Our results indicated that the phytoplankton community in the study areas could be mainly classified into 1. Cryptophyta dominated group, 2. Biologically diverse group, and 3. Cyanobacteria dominated group. The Multinomial Logistic Regression model indicated the Cryptophyta dominated group was sensitive to temperature, while other groups were sensitive to both temperature and nutrients. The interactive effects of temperature and nutrients were synergistic in the cyanobacteria dominated group, while they were antagonistic or minor in other groups. The Negative Binomial Regression model suggested high total phosphorus and low total nitrogen but not temperature were responsible for high cyanobacteria abundance. The conditional plot indicated nutrients affected cyanobacteria abundance more significantly under low wind speeds and lake volume fluctuations, and cyanobacteria abundance in the cyanobacteria dominated group maintained high levels with increasing hydrological dynamics. Our results demonstrated that environmental factors played inconsistently significant roles in different phytoplankton groups, and reducing nutrients could decrease adverse effects of warming and water project constructions. Our models can also be applied to forecast phytoplankton shifting and cyanobacteria abundance in the management of regulated shallow lakes.","[Rao, Ke; Zhang, Xiang; Xu, Jing] Wuhan Univ, State Key Lab Water Resources & Hydropower Engn S, Wuhan 430072, Peoples R China; [Rao, Ke; Zhang, Xiang; Xu, Jing] Wuhan Univ, Hubei Key Lab Water Syst Sci Sponge City Construc, Wuhan 430072, Peoples R China; [Rao, Ke; Wang, Mo; Guo, Wenqi] Hydrol & Water Resources Survey Bur Wuhan City, Wuhan 430074, Peoples R China; [Liu, Jianfeng] Changjiang Water Resources Commiss, Changjiang River Sci Res Inst, Wuhan 430010, Peoples R China; [Huang, Guangwei] Sophia Univ, Grad Sch Global Environm Studies, Tokyo 1028554, Japan",,"Zhang, X (corresponding author), Wuhan Univ, Sch Water Resources & Hydropower Engn, 8 Donghu South Rd, Wuhan 430072, Peoples R China.",zhangxiang@whu.edu.cn,"Rao, Ke/ABC-1172-2021","Zhang, Xiang/0000-0003-0965-7298",National Key Research and Develop-ment Program of China [2019YFC0408901]; National Natural Science Foundation of ChinaNational Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC) [41890823],"This research was funded by National Key Research and Develop-ment Program of China (No. 2019YFC0408901) and the National Natural Science Foundation of China (No.41890823) .

Results indicate that shifts in the seasonality of precipitation and changing climatology are consistent with periods of overprediction and underprediction in streamflow forecasts. Multiple linear regression of SNOTEL data, postcedent precipitation, and land-cover changes explained 2%-18% more variability in streamflow prediction than using SNOTEL station data alone. Simulated basin-wide snowpack from a physically based model had significant negative trends in snow water equivalent (-4.33 mm/yr) and snow-covered area (-0.05%/yr) during the melt period April-June. Simulated streamflow from a precipitation-runoff model increased an average 5% when the effects of bark beetle-induced tree mortality were compared to a baseline simulation with static vegetation. The effects of a 2013 wildfire increased simulated seasonal streamflow an average 35% for 1-4 years postfire.

Population increase and water cycle intensification are extending not only globally but also among Pakistan's water resources. The frequency of floods has increased in the last few decades in the country, which emphasizes the importance of efficient practices needed to adopt for various aspects of water resource management such as reservoir scheduling, water sustainability, and water supply. The purpose of this study is to develop a novel hybrid model for streamflow forecasting and validate its efficiency at the upper Indus basin (UIB), Pakistan. Maximum streamflow in the River Indus from its upper mountain basin results from melting snow or glaciers and climatic unevenness of both precipitation and temperature inputs, which will, therefore, affect rural livelihoods at both a local and a regional scale through effects on runoff in the Upper Indus basin (UIB). This indicates that basins receive the bulk of snowfall input to sustain the glacier system. The present study will help find the runoff from high altitude catchments and estimated flood occurrence for the proposed and constructed hydropower projects of the Upper Indus basin (UIB). Due to climate variability, the upper Indus basin (UIB) was further divided into three zone named as sub-zones, zone one (z1), zone two (z2), and zone three (z3). The hybrid models are designed by incorporating artificial intelligence (AI) models, which includes Feedforward backpropagation (FFBP) and Radial basis function (RBF) with decomposition methods. This includes a discrete wavelet transform (DWT) and ensemble empirical mode decomposition (EEMD). On the basis of the autocorrelation function and the cross-correlation function of streamflow, precipitation and temperature inputs are selected for all developed models. Data have been analyzed by comparing the simulation outputs of the models with a correlation coefficient (R), root mean square errors (RMSE), Nash-Sutcliffe Efficiency (NSE), mean absolute percentage error (MAPE), and mean absolute errors (MAE). The proposed hybrid models have been applied to monthly streamflow observations from three hydrological stations and 17 meteorological stations in the UIB. The results show that the prediction accuracy of the decomposition-based models is usually better than those of AI-based models. Among the DWT and EEMD based hybrid model, EEMD has performed significantly well when compared to all other hybrid and individual AI models. The peak value analysis is also performed to confirm the results' precision rate during the flood season (May-October). The detailed comparative analysis showed that the RBFNN integrated with EEMD has better forecasting capabilities as compared to other developed models and EEMD-RBF can capture the nonlinear characteristics of the streamflow time series during the flood season with more precision.","[Tayyab, Muhammad; Dong, Xiaohua] China Three Gorges Univ, Coll Hydraul & Environm Engn, Yichang 443002, Peoples R China; [Tayyab, Muhammad; Sun, Na; Zhou, Jianzhong] Huazhong Univ Sci & Technol, Sch Hydropower & Informat Engn, Wuhan 430074, Hubei, Peoples R China; [Ahmad, Ijaz] Univ Engn & Technol, Ctr Excellence Water Resources Engn, Lahore 54890, Pakistan; [Dong, Xiaohua] Hubei Prov Collaborat Innovat Ctr Water Secur, Wuhan 430070, Hubei, Peoples R China",,"Dong, XH (corresponding author), China Three Gorges Univ, Coll Hydraul & Environm Engn, Yichang 443002, Peoples R China.; Dong, XH (corresponding author), Hubei Prov Collaborat Innovat Ctr Water Secur, Wuhan 430070, Hubei, Peoples R China.",mtayyab@hust.edu.cn; ijaz.ahmad@cewre.edu.pk; sunna@hust.edu.cn; jz.zhou@hust.edu.cn; xhdong@ctgu.edu.cn,"Ahmad, Ijaz/AAX-8015-2021","Ahmad, Ijaz/0000-0002-7219-8533; TAYYAB, MUHAMMAD/0000-0002-0638-3044","State Key Program of National Natural Science of ChinaNational Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC) [51239004]; National Natural Science Foundation of ChinaNational Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC) [51309105, 40701024]; Power Construction Corporation of China [DJ-ZDZX-2016-02]","This study was supported by the State Key Program of National Natural Science of China (51239004), the National Natural Science Foundation of China (51309105, 40701024) and the application research of hydro-meteorological major key technology funded by the Power Construction Corporation of China (DJ-ZDZX-2016-02).",,105,13,14,4,17,MDPI,BASEL,"ST ALBAN-ANLAGE 66, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND",,2073-4433,,ATMOSPHERE-BASEL,Atmosphere,DEC,2018,9,12,,,,,,,494,10.3390/atmos9120494,,,35,Environmental Sciences; Meteorology & Atmospheric Sciences,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),Environmental Sciences & Ecology; Meteorology & Atmospheric Sciences,HG6AB,WOS:000455062300038,,gold,,,2022-02-17

Informing reservoir operation for real-time flood control coping with forecast uncertainty encourages overall robust control of risk probability, vulnerability, and resilience of upstream and downstream protection areas. Current stochastic programming models or chance constrained programming models (CCP) focuses on reducing either risk loss or vulnerability, thereby failing to ensure systematic control. This study established a robust multiobjective operation and risk decision-making model to inform reservoir operations. The proposed model includes three modules. First, a copula function was applied to capture multidimensional temporal dependences of forecast uncertainties, following which stochastic inflow scenarios were generated. Second, a robust multiobjective optimization (RMOO) model was established with the objectives of minimizing the probability of risk events, Conditional Value-at-Risk of risk loss (vulnerability) and the maximum sequential duration for both upstream and downstream areas. Then, an adaptive reference multiobjective evolutionary algorithm was used to solve the model and obtain noninferior solutions. Finally, the TOPSIS multicriteria decision-making method was introduced to select the compromise solution. Methodologies were verified by application to Xianghongdian reservoir, China. The main findings were as follows. (1) The copula function effectively captured the multidimensional positive temporal dependences of forecast uncertainties. (2) RMOO provided more widely distributed noninferior solutions than CCP, and performed better in lowering vulnerability of the system. (3) RMOO reduced the maximum release by 135.6 m(3)/s (7.33%) by increasing prerelease before the occurrence of flood peak. The proposed methodologies provide insights for supporting robust control of real-time operations of a reservoir system through simultaneous control of flood risk probability, vulnerability, and resilience.","[Huang, Xin; Xu, Bin; Zhong, Ping-an; Yao, Hongyi; Yue, Hao; Zhu, Feilin; Lu, Qingwen; Sun, Yu; Mo, Ran] Hohai Univ, Coll Hydrol & Water Resources, Nanjing 210098, Peoples R China; [Xu, Bin] Nanjing Hydraul Res Inst, State Key Lab Hydrol Water Resources & Hydraul En, Nanjing 210029, Peoples R China; [Xu, Bin] CMA HHU Joint Lab Hydrometeorol Studies, Nanjing 210098, Peoples R China; [Li, Zhen; Liu, Weifeng] Minist Water Resources, Gen Inst Water Resources & Hydropower Planning &, Beijing 100120, Peoples R China",,"Xu, B (corresponding author), Hohai Univ, Coll Hydrol & Water Resources, Nanjing 210098, Peoples R China.",xinhuang@hhu.edu.cn; xubin_hhu@hhu.edu.cn; zhongpa_hhu@163.com; yaohy1@outlook.com; yh1005@hhu.edu.cn; zhufeilin@hhu.edu.cn; luqw@hhu.edu.cn; sunyu666@hhu.edu.cn; hhuhazardmo@163.com; lizhen@giwp.org.cn; liuweifeng@giwp.org.cn,,,"Fundamental Research Funds for the Central UniversitiesFundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities [B200202028, B200204038, B200202032]; China Postdoctoral Science FoundationChina Postdoctoral Science Foundation [2018T110525]; Qing Lan Project of Jiangsu Province","TThis study is supported by the Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities (Grant No. B200202028, B200204038, B200202032), the China Postdoctoral Science Foundation Funded Project (Grant No. 2018T110525), and Qing Lan Project of Jiangsu Province.

In contrast, hybrid statistical-dynamical forecasts (combining statistical methods with dynamical climate predictions) are still uncommon, and their skill is largely unknown. Here we conduct systematic forecasting of seasonal streamflow using eight GCMs from the North American Multi-Model Ensemble, 0.5-9.5 months ahead, at 290 stream gauges in the U.S. Midwest. Probabilistic forecasts are developed for low to high streamflow using predictors that reflect climatic and anthropogenic influences. Results indicate that GCM forecasts of climate and antecedent climatic conditions enhance seasonal streamflow predictability; while land cover and population density predictors decrease biases or enhance skill in certain catchments. This paper paves the way for novel forecasting approaches using dynamical GCM predictions within statistical frameworks. Plain Language Summary Streamflow forecasts several months ahead of a season are important for water management and the prevention of risks related to floods and hydrological droughts. However, existing methods for producing seasonal streamflow forecasts are often complex and computationally intensive. Here we provide a systematic evaluation of a statistical-dynamical approach to streamflow forecasting in several hundred river catchments across the U.S. Midwest. We assess whether global climate model forecasts can be used as predictors in statistical models to produce skillful forecasts of river flow, up to 10 months ahead. Results indicate that forecasts of rainfall and temperature, antecedent climatic conditions, as well as information on population density and land cover, can be used effectively to forecast streamflow at seasonal time scales. By including information on the future antecedent climatic conditions, streamflow forecasts can be enhanced months ahead. Information on human influences, in contrast, helps reduce the biases in the streamflow forecasts. These results pave the way for statistical-dynamical forecasting in catchments around the world and suggest that process-driven combinations of different predictors can be used to produce skillful streamflow forecasts in different seasons, for both high flows (i.e., floods) and low flows (i.e., representative of hydrological droughts).","[Slater, Louise J.] Loughborough Univ, Dept Geog, Loughborough, Leics, England; [Villarini, Gabriele] Univ Iowa, IIHR Hydrosci & Engn, Iowa City, IA USA",,"Slater, LJ (corresponding author), Loughborough Univ, Dept Geog, Loughborough, Leics, England.",l.slater@lboro.ac.uk,"Villarini, Gabriele/F-8069-2016","Villarini, Gabriele/0000-0001-9566-2370; Slater, Louise/0000-0001-9416-488X",Broad Agency Announcement (BAA) Program; Engineer Research and Development Center (ERDC)-Cold Regions Research and Engineering Laboratory (CRREL)United States Department of Defense [W913E5-16-C-0002]; National Science Foundation under CAREER grant [AGS-1349827],"We thank two anonymous reviewers for helpful feedback, Christel Prudhomme for constructive discussion, as well as the different modeling centers, and the USGS for making their data publicly available.

The feature selection methods in the current hydrology research community are not able to handle the problem in such basins. The paper proposes a novel feature selection algorithm-Bubble Selection-based on the idea of utilizing geographic distance as a metric. Evaluation of the performance of the algorithm is carried out by applying the Bubble Selection, to the case study of modeling Austria's water resources of 540 stations in a single run mode. The aim is to select features for each station among 2412 stations, streamflow, precipitation, snow, snow depth, and water level measurements are available. The proposed algorithm allows considerably reducing the dimension of features. The Bubble Selection algorithm is further combined with the Sequential Forward Selection algorithm. Performance of the hybrid model is compared with the performance of Feature Ranking method in terms of the coefficient of determination, Nash-Sutcliffe Efficiency, and percent bias. The results show the superiority of the proposed hybrid algorithm over the Feature Ranking. The paper introduces a methodology to model a large basin and it reveals some skills that a feature selection algorithm should have.","[Selvi, O.] Istanbul Aydin Univ, Fac Engn, Dept Comp Engn, Istanbul, Turkey; [Huseyinov, I.] Istanbul Aydin Univ, Fac Engn, Software Engn Dept, Istanbul, Turkey",,"Selvi, O (corresponding author), Istanbul Aydin Univ, Fac Engn, Dept Comp Engn, Istanbul, Turkey.",osmanselvi84@gmail.com,"SELVİ, Osman/AAH-5875-2020","SELVİ, Osman/0000-0001-8666-9984",,,,27,1,1,0,5,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"ONE NEW YORK PLAZA, SUITE 4600, NEW YORK, NY, UNITED STATES",1735-1472,1735-2630,,INT J ENVIRON SCI TE,Int.

Based on an Instantaneous Point Source Two-dimensional Water Quality Model and the security requirements of water quality, an early warning and forecasting model was presented, and then the system was advanced by a MATLAB platform. In addition, a hypothetical case was also carried out for the Fenghuangshan drinking water source area. Within 0.040 h to 0.096 h after the accident, the water quality could meet the standard, and the warning level was primary and intermediate, sequentially. From 0.096 h to 11.960 h after the accident, the pollutant concentration exceeded the standard, under which conditions advanced warning started. Then the intermediate and primary warnings restarted in sequence until the pollutant concentration decreased to the background value. Therefore, the proposed model could accurately predict the spatial-temporal change trend of pollutant concentration, and the developed system could efficiently realize early warnings and the forecasting of water quality safety.","[Ding, Xiaowen; Zhang, Jianjie; Jiang, Guihong; Zhang, Shanghong] North China Elect Power Univ, Minist Educ, Key Lab Reg Energy & Environm Syst Optimizat, Beijing 102206, Peoples R China; [Ding, Xiaowen] Univ Regina, Inst Energy Environm & Sustainable Communities, Regina, SK S4S 7H9, Canada",,"Ding, XW (corresponding author), North China Elect Power Univ, Minist Educ, Key Lab Reg Energy & Environm Syst Optimizat, Beijing 102206, Peoples R China.; Ding, XW (corresponding author), Univ Regina, Inst Energy Environm & Sustainable Communities, Regina, SK S4S 7H9, Canada.",binger2000dxw@hotmail.com; zhangjj150118@163.com; Jiangguihong109@163.com; zhangshanghong@ncepu.edu.cn,,,key technology and demonstration of improving water quality of reservoir areas by the joint scheduling of the cascade reservoir group [2014ZX07104-005]; Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities of PRC,"The work described in this study was funded by the key technology and demonstration of improving water quality of reservoir areas by the joint scheduling of the cascade reservoir group (2014ZX07104-005), and the Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities of PRC.",,31,1,4,3,30,MDPI,BASEL,"ST ALBAN-ANLAGE 66, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND",2073-4441,,,WATER-SUI,Water,JUL,2017,9,7,,,,,,,465,10.3390/w9070465,,,15,Environmental Sciences; Water Resources,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),Environmental Sciences & Ecology; Water Resources,FC2PY,WOS:000406681700016,,"Green Submitted, gold",,,2022-02-17

MLPNN model was employed to determine the optimal input combinations of each station implementing evaluation criteria. In both training and testing stages in the three stations, the results of comparison indicated that the EPR technique would generally perform more efficiently than MLPNN and OP-ELM models.

The majority of annual runoff is derived from spring snowmelt, and therefore April-July water supply volume (WSV) forecasts produced by the Colorado Basin River Forecast Center are critical to basin water management. The primary objective of this study was to evaluate the impact of snow data assimilation (DA) in a distributed hydrologic model on WSV forecasting error and skill in headwater catchments of the UCRB. To do this, a framework was built to use the Localized Ensemble transform Kalman filter to update modeled snow water equivalent (SWE) states in the Hydrology Laboratory-Research Distributed Hydrologic Model with SNOTEL SWE observations and spatially and temporally complete MODIS Snow Covered-Area and Grain size data. The DA approach was assessed by evaluating ensemble streamflow prediction forecasts over a 20-year period for 23 catchments in the UCRB. Overall, the DA approach improved water supply forecast skill in 80% of pilot basins with an average improvement in the median continuous rank probability skill score of 4%. A research-to-operations transition was facilitated by automating the implementation of the DA approach. This work demonstrates the capacity for gridded and point snow products to be used to objectively update model states in an operational forecasting setting.","[Micheletty, P.; Perrot, D.; Day, G.] RTI Int Ft Collins, Ctr Water Resources, Ft Collins, CO 80528 USA; [Rittger, K.] Univ Colorado, Inst Arctic & Alpine Res, Boulder, CO 80309 USA",,"Micheletty, P (corresponding author), RTI Int Ft Collins, Ctr Water Resources, Ft Collins, CO 80528 USA.",pmicheletty@rti.org,,"Micheletty, Paul/0000-0002-4173-2684",NASA's water resources program [13-WATER13-0072]; RTI International,This work was supported by NASA's water resources program (no. 13-WATER13-0072) and partially through RTI International.

This study developed an artificial intelligence (AI)-based management methodology that integrated multi-step streamflow forecasts and multi-objective reservoir operation optimization for water resource allocation. Following the methodology, we aimed to assess forecast quality and forecast-informed reservoir operation performance together due to the influence of inflow forecast uncertainty. Varying combinations of climate and hydrological variables were input into three AI-based models, namely a long short-term memory (LSTM), a gated recurrent unit (GRU), and a least-squares support vector machine (LSSVM), to forecast short-term streamflow. Based on three deterministic forecasts, the stochastic inflow scenarios were further developed using Bayesian model averaging (BMA) for quantifying uncertainty. The forecasting scheme was further coupled with a multi-reservoir optimization model, and the multi-objective programming was solved using the parameterized multi-objective robust decision-making (MORDM) approach. The AI-based management framework was applied and demonstrated over a multi-reservoir system (25 reservoirs) in the Zhoushan Islands, China. Three main conclusions were drawn from this study: (1) GRU and LSTM performed equally well on streamflow forecasts, and GRU might be the preferred method over LSTM, given that it had simpler structures and less modeling time; (2) higher forecast performance could lead to improved reservoir operation, while uncertain forecasts were more valuable than deterministic forecasts, regarding two performance metrics, i.e., water supply reliability and operating costs; (3) the relationship between the forecast horizon and reservoir operation was complex and depended on the operating configurations (forecast quality and uncertainty) and performance measures. This study reinforces the potential of an AI-based stochastic streamflow forecasting scheme to seek robust strategies under uncertainty.","[Guo, Yuxue; Yu, Xinting; Xu, Yue-Ping; Chen, Hao; Gu, Haiting; Xie, Jingkai] Zhejiang Univ, Inst Hydrol & Water Resources Civil Engn & Archit, Hangzhou 310058, Peoples R China",,"Xu, YP (corresponding author), Zhejiang Univ, Inst Hydrol & Water Resources Civil Engn & Archit, Hangzhou 310058, Peoples R China.",yuepingxu@zju.edu.cn,,"Chen, Hao/0000-0001-9704-2781",Key Project of Zhejiang Natural Science Foundation [LZ20E090001]; Zhejiang Key Research and Development Program [2021C03017]; Fundamental Research Funds for the Zhejiang Provincial Universities [2021XZZX015],"This research has been supported by the Key Project of Zhejiang Natural Science Foundation (grant no.

The accuracies of the models are compared for three basins, that is, 1801, 1805, and 1822, at the Seyhan River Basin in Turkey. The comparison was performed by using coefficient of efficiency, index of agreement, and root-mean-square error. Results indicate that ANN and ANFIS are more accurate than AR and SVM for all the basins. ANN and ANFIS perform similarly, while ANN outperformed ANFIS.

Forecasting the phenology of fish migration is thus critically important to implement management actions aimed at protecting fish during their migration. In this study, an 11-year monitoring survey of Atlantic salmon smolts (Salmo salar) from the Ourthe River, Belgium, was analysed within a European Special Area of Conservation to improve the understanding of environment-induced spring migration. A logistic model was fitted to forecast smolt migration and to calculate phenological indicators for management, i.e. the onset, end, and duration of migration, while accounting for the influence of photoperiod, water temperature, and hydrological conditions. The results indicated that the photo-thermal units accumulated by smolts above a 7 degrees C temperature threshold was a relevant proxy to reflect the synergistic effect between temperature and photoperiod on smolt migration. After integrating the effect of river flow pulses, the model accurately explained the inter-annual changes in migration timing (R-2= 0.95). The model predictions provide decisive management information to identify sensitive periods during which mitigation measures (e.g. hydropower turbine shutdown, river discharge management) should be conducted to promote smolt survival. The model was used to predict phenological characteristics under future scenarios of climate change. The results suggest a joint effect of hydrological alterations and water warming. Temperature increases of 1-4 degrees C were associated with earlier initiation of migration, 6-51 days earlier, and spring flood events greatly influenced the duration of the migration period. Accordingly, the combined effects of human-induced modifications of the hydrological regimes and increasing temperatures could result in a mismatch between the smolt and favourable survival conditions in the marine environment.","[Teichert, Nils; Trancart, Thomas; Feunteun, Eric; Ovidio, Michael] MNHN, CNRS, Lab Biol Organismes & Ecosyst Aquat BOREA, IRD,SU,UCN,UA,Stn Marine Dinard, Dinard, France; [Benitez, Jean-Philippe; Dierckx, Arnaud] Univ Liege, Biol Behav Unit, Lab Fish Demog & Hydroecol, UR FOCUS, Liege, Belgium; [Tetard, Stephane; de Oliveira, Eric] EDF R&D LNHE LabNatl Hydraul & Environm, Chatou, France",,"Teichert, N (corresponding author), MNHN, CNRS, Lab Biol Organismes & Ecosyst Aquat BOREA, IRD,SU,UCN,UA,Stn Marine Dinard, Dinard, France.",nils.teichert@mnhn.fr,,"Teichert, Nils/0000-0002-8873-9613; Ovidio, Michael/0000-0002-0136-5840","European UnionEuropean Commission; Public Service of Wallonia, General Operational Direction of Agriculture, Natural Resources and Environment, Nature and Forest Department","European Union; Public Service of Wallonia, General Operational Direction of Agriculture, Natural Resources and Environment, Nature and Forest Department",,78,8,8,1,18,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",1052-7613,1099-0755,,AQUAT CONSERV,Aquat.

Therefore, the hybrid model is robust and efficient for forecasting highly nonstationary and nonlinear streamflow. It can be used as the preferred data-driven tool to predict the daily inflow flow, which can ensure the safe operation of hydropower stations in reservoirs. As an interdisciplinary field spanning both machine learning and hydrology, daily inflow forecasting can become an important breakthrough in the application of deep learning to hydrology.","[Li, Fugang; Ma, Guangwen; Chen, Shijun; Huang, Weibin] Sichuan Univ, Coll Water Resource & Hydropower, Chengdu 610065, Peoples R China; [Li, Fugang; Ma, Guangwen; Chen, Shijun; Huang, Weibin] Sichuan Univ, State Key Lab Hydraul & Mt River Engn, Chengdu 610065, Peoples R China",,"Li, FG; Ma, GW (corresponding author), Sichuan Univ, Coll Water Resource & Hydropower, Chengdu 610065, Peoples R China.; Li, FG; Ma, GW (corresponding author), Sichuan Univ, State Key Lab Hydraul & Mt River Engn, Chengdu 610065, Peoples R China.",lifg1995@163.com; magw1960@163.com,,,National Key R&D Program of China [2018YFB0905204],the National Key R&D Program of China (2018YFB0905204).,,41,0,0,19,29,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0920-4741,1573-1650,,WATER RESOUR MANAG,Water Resour.

The presence of low-frequency structures in hydrologic time series is an important feature. It can modify the probability of extreme events occurring in different time scales, which makes the risk associated with extreme events dynamic, changing from one decade to another. This article proposes a methodology capable of dynamically detecting and predicting low-frequency streamflow (16-32 years), which presented significance in the wavelet power spectrum. The Standardized Runoff Index (SRI), the Pruned Exact Linear Time (PELT) algorithm, the breaks for additive seasonal and trend (BFAST) method, and the hidden Markov model (HMM) were used to identify the shifts in low frequency. The HMM was also used to forecast the low frequency. As part of the results, the regime shifts detected by the BFAST approach are not entirely consistent with results from the other methods. A common shift occurs in the mid-1980s and can be attributed to the construction of the reservoir. Climate variability modulates the streamflow low-frequency variability, and anthropogenic activities and climate change can modify this modulation. The identification of shifts reveals the impact of low frequency in the streamflow time series, showing that the low-frequency variability conditions the flows of a given year.","[Rafael Rolim, Larissa Zaira; de Souza Filho, Francisco de Assis] Univ Fed Ceara, Hydraul & Environm Engn Dept DEHA, BR-60440970 Fortaleza, Ceara, Brazil",,"Rolim, LZR (corresponding author), Univ Fed Ceara, Hydraul & Environm Engn Dept DEHA, BR-60440970 Fortaleza, Ceara, Brazil.",larissazairarr@gmail.com; assis@ufc.br,"de Assis Souza Filho, Francisco/AAV-8783-2020","de Assis Souza Filho, Francisco/0000-0001-5989-1731; Rolim, Larissa/0000-0002-2550-1691",Conselho Nacional de Desenvolvimento Cientifico e Tecnologico-Brasil (CNPq)Conselho Nacional de Desenvolvimento Cientifico e Tecnologico (CNPQ) [441457/2017-7],"This research was funded by the Conselho Nacional de Desenvolvimento Cientifico e Tecnologico-Brasil (CNPq), grant number 441457/2017-7 (NEXUS project).",,58,4,4,2,7,MDPI,BASEL,"ST ALBAN-ANLAGE 66, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND",,2073-4441,,WATER-SUI,Water,JUL,2020,12,7,,,,,,,2058,10.3390/w12072058,,,16,Environmental Sciences; Water Resources,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),Environmental Sciences & Ecology; Water Resources,MS3RJ,WOS:000554197400001,,gold,,,2022-02-17

A semi-distributed hydrological model, TsingHua Representative Elementary Watershed (THREW), is implemented to simulate the rainfall-runoff processes, with the help of hydrological ensemble prediction system (HEPS) approach. A post-processing method, quantile mapping method, is applied to bias correct the raw precipitation forecasts. Then we evaluate the performance of raw and post-processed streamflow forecasts for the four hydrological stations along the mainstream of Hanjiang River from 2001 to 2008. The results show that the performance of the streamflow forecasts is greatly enhanced with post-processing precipitation forecasts, especially in pre-dry season (November and December), thus providing useful information for water supply management of the central route of South to North Water Diversion Project (SNWDP).

We investigate the uncertainty of forecast sediment transport from sources, including global climate model realizations, global climate model ensemble design, forecasted hydrologic inputs, and hydrologic modeling parameterization. We then forecast sediment transport for the gently rolling watershed in Kentucky, USA. Contrary to past research forecasting hydrology with global climate models, hydrologic model parameterization was the most significant source of variance impacting forecasted sediment transport variables. Forecast of sediment transport responses shows the propagation of uncertainty from the hydrologic model parameterization was over two times greater than the uncertainty from the selected global climate model realizations. This result emphasizes researchers focused on forecasting sediment transport with global climate models may need to give as much, or more, consideration to their water-sediment linkages as climate-water-sediment linkages. Hydrologic inputs from climate change, including forecast precipitation, temperature, relative humidity, solar radiation, and wind speed, impacted sediment transport. Considering changes in precipitation and temperature alone under-predicts streamflow and sediment transport by 49% and 35%, respectively, compared to including all meteorological variables inputs. Variance introduced across the three different global climate model ensembles was a relatively small source of variance impacting forecasted streamflow or sediment yield. The results suggest a quantitative effort by the researcher to design the global climate model ensemble by considering representativeness, historical performance, and independency will lead to robust results. Ensemble average forecasts forecast streamflow and sediment yield to increase by 19% and 14%, respectively, for the lowland watershed. The sediment transport forecasts reflect the shear-limited landscape of the watershed and the transport-limited conditions in the stream channel.","[Al Aamery, Nabil; Fox, James F.] Univ Kentucky, Civil Engn, Lexington, KY 40506 USA; [Mahoney, Tyler] Univ Louisville, Civil & Environm Engn Dept, 132 Eastern Pkwy, Louisville, KY 40292 USA",,"Fox, JF (corresponding author), Univ Kentucky, Civil Engn, Lexington, KY 40506 USA.",james.fox@uky.edu,,,National Science Foundation (NSF)National Science Foundation (NSF) [163288],"We gratefully acknowledge the financial support of the this research under National Science Foundation (NSF) Award 163288.

Four quantitative statistical indexes are chosen as the evaluation benchmarks. The results from two huge hydropower reservoirs in China show that five artificial intelligence methods can achieve satisfying forecasting results, while the SVM, GPR and ELM methods can produce better performances than ANN and ANFIS in both training and testing phases with respective to four indexes.

The improved dynamic clustering algorithm is used to classify the eutrophication degree of waterbodies according to the total phosphorus and total nitrogen content. Considering four meteorological factors, air temperature, water temperature, water surface evaporation, and rainfall, synthetically for each water quality condition, the total phosphorus and total nitrogen in the waterbody are forecasted by an improved forward NARX dynamic regression neural network.

The advancement and availability of the seasonal flow forecasts provide the opportunity for reservoir operators to use flexible and early impoundment operation rules (EIOR). These flexible impoundment rules can significantly improve water conservation, particularly during dry years. In this study, we investigate the potential application of seasonal streamflow forecasts for employing EIOR in the upper Yangtze River basin. We first define thresholds to determine the streamflow condition in September, which is an important period for decision-making in the basin, and then select the most suitable impoundment operation rules accordingly. The thresholds are used in a simulation-optimization model to evaluate different scenarios for EIOR and SIOR by multiple objectives. We measure the skill of the GloFAS-Seasonal forecast, an operational global seasonal river flow forecasting system, to predict streamflow condition according to the selected thresholds. The results show that: (1) the 20th and 30th percentiles of the historical September flow are suitable thresholds for evaluating the possibility of employing EIOR; (2) compared to climatological forecasts, GloFAS-Seasonal forecasts are skillful for predicting the streamflow condition according to the selected 20th and 30th percentile thresholds; and (3) during dry years, EIOR could improve the fullness storage rate by 5.63% and the annual average hydropower generation by 4.02%, without increasing the risk of flooding.

While there is a burgeoning field of science targeted at improving forecast products and associated decision support models, data describing how and when forecasts are applied in practice remain undeveloped. This lack of knowledge may prevent hydrological modelers from developing accurate reservoir release schemes for large-scale, distributed hydrology models that are increasingly used to assess the vulnerabilities of large regions to hydrological stress. We address this issue by estimating seasonally varying, regulated inflow forecast horizons used in the operations of more than 300 dams throughout the conterminous United States (CONUS). For each dam, we take actual forward observed inflows (perfect foresight) as a proxy for forecasted flows available to the operator and then identify for each week of the year the forward horizon that best explains the release decisions taken. Resulting horizon curves specify for each dam the inferred inflow forecast horizon as a function of the week of the water year. These curves are analyzed for strength of evidence for contribution of medium- to long-range forecasts in decision making. We use random forest classification to estimate that approximately 80% of large dams and reservoirs in the US (1553 +/- 50 out of 1927 dams with at least 10 Mm(3) storage capacity) adopt medium- to long-range inflow forecasts to inform release decisions during at least part of the water year. Long-range forecast horizons (more than 6 weeks ahead) are detected in the operations of reservoirs located in high-elevation regions of the western US, where snowpack information likely guides the release. A simulation exercise conducted on four key western US reservoirs indicates that forecast-informed models of reservoir operations may outperform models that neglect the horizon curve - including during flood and drought conditions.","[Turner, Sean W.

As the mechanism of algal blooms is not understood, the construction of prediction model mainly depends on statistical data. Therefore, knowledge on prior bloom occurrence derived from statistical data plays a significant role in establishing a prediction model. In this study, a naive Bayesian model incorporating prior information was constructed to predict algal bloom occurrence probabilities 1-7 days in advance under different weather conditions in Dianchi Lake. The proposed model utilised the following data from the MODIS images, the floating algae index (FAI) for the previous 7 days and five meteorological variables (mean wind speed, air pressure, relative humidity on the prediction day, accumulated sunshine hours in the previous 3 days, and accumulated air temperature in the previous 7 days). The prior probabilities of each pixel were calculated on a monthly timescale to highlight the bloom's temporal-spatial differences, and the 1-7 day posterior probabilities were calculated by combining the prior and conditional probabilities. The predictive effect was tested by the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC), and the results showed the number of pixels with estimation predictions classified as 'Good+' and 'Excellent' were 91.3%, 91.4%, 82.7%, 83.3%, 89.0%, 86.6%, and 90.0% for the predictions on days 1-7, respectively. Additionally, the independent validation datasets showed that the percentage of correctly classified instances (CCI%) of approximately 90% of the pixels were greater than 50%. The proposed algal bloom prediction model based on the naive Bayesian method has pixel-level prediction abilities, is applicable to other inland water systems, and can provide a reference for water environment risk forecasting and management.","[Mu, Meng; Li, Yunmei; Bi, Shun; Lyu, Heng; Xu, Jie; Lei, Shaohua; Miao, Song; Zeng, Shuai] Nanjing Normal Univ, Educ Minist, Key Lab Virtual Geog Environm, Nanjing 210023, Peoples R China; [Mu, Meng; Li, Yunmei; Bi, Shun; Lyu, Heng; Xu, Jie; Lei, Shaohua; Miao, Song; Zeng, Shuai] Jiangsu Ctr Collaborat Invocat Geog Informat Reso, Nanjing 210023, Peoples R China; [Zheng, Zhubin] Gannan Normal Univ, Sch Geog & Environm Engn, Ganzhou 341000, Peoples R China; [Du, Chenggong] Huaiyin Normal Univ, Jiangsu Collaborat Innovat Ctr Reg Modern Agr & E, Huaiyin 223300, Peoples R China",,"Li, YM (corresponding author), Nanjing Normal Univ, Educ Minist, Key Lab Virtual Geog Environm, Nanjing 210023, Peoples R China.",liyunmei@njnu.edu.cn,"Lyu, Heng/F-3335-2017","Lyu, Heng/0000-0003-2844-3746",Major Projects of High Resolution Earth Observation Systems of National Science and Technology [05Y30B01-9001-19/20-2]; National Natural Science Foundation of ChinaNational Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC) [41701412]; Major Science and Technology Program for Water Pollution Control and Treatment [2017ZX07302-003]; Natural Science Foundation of Jiangxi ProvinceNatural Science Foundation of Jiangxi Province [20171BAB213024]; Natural Science Foundation of Jiangsu ProvinceNatural Science Foundation of Jiangsu Province [BK20191058],"This study was supported by the Major Projects of High Resolution Earth Observation Systems of National Science and Technology (No. 05Y30B01-9001-19/20-2), the National Natural Science Foundation of China [No. 41701412], the Major Science and Technology Program for Water Pollution Control and Treatment [No. 2017ZX07302-003], the Natural Science Foundation of Jiangxi Province [No. 20171BAB213024], and the Natural Science Foundation of Jiangsu Province [No. BK20191058].",,64,1,1,5,10,ELSEVIER,AMSTERDAM,"RADARWEG 29, 1043 NX AMSTERDAM, NETHERLANDS",1470-160X,1872-7034,,ECOL INDIC,Ecol.

The inherent uncertainty in inflow forecasts however means that it remains a challenge to balance the risks of flooding against those of water shortages. Few studies have examined how the risks of floods and water shortages can be managed using reservoir operation rules. In this study, a two-phase stochastic optimization model was built to determine the optimal conservation level for flood water by minimizing the risks from both floods and water shortages. For the optimal condition, hedging rules were analytically derived as a quasi-linear function of the storage capability and the expected water shortage. The rules indicate that the flood water conservation was achieved when the marginal upstream flood risk was equal to the marginal water shortage risk, and that the limits of three operation zones divided by the expected water availability should be used when determining the water release. The results from testing the model with data from the Xianghongdian Reservoir (China) showed that the hedging rules outperformed the capacity-constrained pre-release rules for conserving flood water without increasing the flood risk. This proposed methodology will inform the process for making decisions about how to operate reservoirs to ensure optimal real-time flood water conservation.","[Xu, Bin; Huang, Xin; Zhong, Ping-an] Hohai Univ, Coll Hydrol & Water Resources, 1 Xikang Rd, Nanjing 210098, Peoples R China; [Xu, Bin] Nanjing Hydraul Res Inst, 223 Guangzhou Rd, Nanjing 210029, Peoples R China; [Wu, Yenan] Univ Alberta, Dept Civil & Environm Engn, Edmonton, AB T6G2W2, Canada",,"Xu, B; Zhong, PA (corresponding author), Hohai Univ, Coll Hydrol & Water Resources, 1 Xikang Rd, Nanjing 210098, Peoples R China.; Xu, B (corresponding author), Nanjing Hydraul Res Inst, 223 Guangzhou Rd, Nanjing 210029, Peoples R China.",xubin_hhu@hhu.edu.cn; xinhuang@hhu.edu.cn; pazhong@hhu.edu.cn; yenan@ualberta.ca,"Xu, Bin/I-7518-2018","Xu, Bin/0000-0002-1281-5560","National Key Technologies R&D Program of ChinaNational Key Technology R&D Program [2017YFC0405604]; Fundamental Research Funds for the Central UniversitiesFundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities [B200202028, B200202032]; China Postdoctoral Science Foundation Funded ProjectChina Postdoctoral Science Foundation [2018 T110525]","This study is supported by National Key Technologies R&D Program of China (Grant No. 2017YFC0405604), the Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities (B200202028, B200202032), and the China Postdoctoral Science Foundation Funded Project (Grant No. 2018 T110525).",,28,6,6,5,33,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0920-4741,1573-1650,,WATER RESOUR MANAG,Water Resour.

It is expected that at the end of this decade, such impacts will be even more noticeable and may harm the inland waters use. However, little is known about the possible consequences of climate change in multipurpose subtropical reservoirs. Using data generated by a regionalized climate model (RCM) as input to a simple hydrological model and a one-dimensional vertical hydrodynamic model, we forecast potential changes in the Itupararanga reservoir, Sao Paulo, Brazil, in an exemplary time period (2028-2030) in the next decade. Two Representative Concentration Pathway (RCP) scenarios were considered: an optimistic one corresponding to a CO2 increase of about 650 ppm (RCP 4.5) and a pessimistic scenario where CO2 exceeds 1000 ppm in 2100 (RCP 8.5). We found a significant reduction in the reservoir water level for both scenarios of 35% compared to current conditions. The surface water temperature is expected to increase (+0.6 degrees C); on the other hand, there would be a cooling of the hypolimnion (RCP 4.5=-0.3 degrees C; RCP 8.5=-1.2 degrees C). Another consequence is an increase of the duration of stratification periods that would start earlier in the dry period (between July and August), as well as the intensification of the stability of the water column (+43% compared to current conditions) and a deepening of the thermocline. The hydrodynamic modeling results suggest that the water level drop may threaten the reservoir multiple uses, in particular drinking water supply and power generation. Furthermore, the heating of surface water layers and increase of the number of stratified days and thermal stability can have negative impacts on water quality. (C) 2021 Elsevier B.V.

In this paper, five decades (1961-2010) of naturalized and observed streamflow datasets are used to investigate hydrological drought characteristics in a heavily managed river basin, the Yellow River basin in north China. Human interventions decrease the correlation between hydrological and meteorological droughts, and make the hydrological drought respond to longer time-scales of meteorological drought. Due to large water consumptions in the middle and lower reaches, there are 118-262% increases in the hydrological drought frequency, up to 8-fold increases in the drought severity, 21-99% increases in the drought duration and the drought onset is earlier. The non-stationarity due to anthropogenic climate change and human water use basically decreases the correlation between meteorological and hydrological droughts and reduces the effect of human interventions on hydrological drought frequency while increasing the effect on drought duration and severity. A set of 29-year (1982-2010) hindcasts from an established seasonal hydrological forecasting system are used to assess the forecast skill of hydrological drought. In the naturalized condition, the climate-model-based approach outperforms the climatology method in predicting the 2001 severe hydrological drought event. Based on the 29-year hindcasts, the former method has a Brier skill score of 11-26% against the latter for the probabilistic hydrological drought forecasting. In the Anthropocene, the skill for both approaches increases due to the dominant influence of human interventions that have been implicitly incorporated by the hydrological postprocessing, while the difference between the two predictions decreases. This suggests that human interventions can outweigh the climate variability for the hydrological drought forecasting in the Anthropocene, and the predictability for human interventions needs more attention.","[Yuan, Xing; Zhang, Miao; Wang, Linying] Chinese Acad Sci, Inst Atmospher Phys, Key Lab Reg Climate Environm Temperate East Asia R, Beijing 100029, Peoples R China; [Zhang, Miao] Univ Chinese Acad Sci, Beijing 100049, Peoples R China; [Zhou, Tian] Pacific Northwest Natl Lab, Richland, WA 99352 USA",,"Yuan, X (corresponding author), Chinese Acad Sci, Inst Atmospher Phys, Key Lab Reg Climate Environm Temperate East Asia R, Beijing 100029, Peoples R China.",yuanxing@tea.ac.cn,"Yuan, Xing/G-8392-2011; Zhou, Tian/F-8659-2015; Zhou, Tian/J-4007-2019","Yuan, Xing/0000-0001-6983-7368; Zhou, Tian/0000-0003-1582-4005; Zhou, Tian/0000-0003-1582-4005; Zhang, Miao/0000-0001-9714-5932",National Natural Science Foundation of ChinaNational Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC) [91547103]; China Special Fund for Meteorological Research in the Public Interest (Major projects) [GYHY201506001]; National Key R&D Program of China [2016YFA0600403]; Thousand Talents Program for Distinguished Young Scholars; Division Of Earth SciencesNational Science Foundation (NSF)NSF - Directorate for Geosciences (GEO) [1606519] Funding Source: National Science Foundation,"We would like to thank Dennis Lettenmaier and three anonymous reviewers for their helpful comments.

However, we need robust reservoir operation systems under both normal flow and extreme flow conditions. In this study, we applied recurrent neural networks (RNN) to simulate the operation of three multi-purpose reservoirs located in the upper Chao Phraya River basin. Two reservoirs have the function of multiannual flow regulation and one has the function of incomplete annual regulation. The goal of this study is to explore the applicability of RNN models for operation of reservoirs with multiannual flow regulation under different flow regimes, especially under extreme floods and droughts. We used three RNNs, namely nonlinear autoregressive models with exogenous input (NARX), long short-term memory (LSTM) and genetic algorithm based NAXR (GA-NAXR) for reservoir operation based on historical data. For real-time water resources management, an accurate inflow forecast is required to provide a real-time reservoir outflow, and thus we also carried out a real-time reservoir operation using the RNN and the inflow forecast by a distributed hydrological model. Results show that (1) GA-NARX has the highest accuracy among three RNNs and is more stable than the original NARX by optimizing the initial conditions, although it takes longer training time than NARX and LSTM; (2) GA-NARX-based operation model is effective under extreme floods and droughts; and (3) the real-time operation system combining the GA-NARX and the distributed hydrological model has reasonable accuracy in both wet season and dry season. RNN-based operation model developed in this study has potential applicability in practical water management, and the model combining the hydrological prediction is specially useful for real-time reservoir operation.","[Yang, Shuyu; Yang, Dawen; Zhao, Baoxu] Tsinghua Univ, Dept Hydraul Engn, State Key Lab Hydrosci & Engn, Beijing 100084, Peoples R China; [Chen, Jinsong] Lawrence Berkeley Natl Lab, Earth & Environm Sci Area, Berkeley, CA USA",,"Yang, DW (corresponding author), Tsinghua Univ, Dept Hydraul Engn, State Key Lab Hydrosci & Engn, Beijing 100084, Peoples R China.",yangdw@tsinghua.edu.cn,"Chen, Jinsong/A-1374-2009",,National Natural Science Foundation of ChinaNational Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC) [41661144031],This work was financially supported by the National Natural Science Foundation of China (project Nos. 41661144031).

In 2011, heavy rainfall from May until October resulted in the largest flood event in the history of Thailand. This event created difficulty for water managers, who lacked information to make predictions. Studies on the 2011 Thai flood have proposed alternative reservoir operations for flood mitigation. However, no study to date has used predictive information to determine how to control reservoirs and mitigate such extreme floods. Thus, the objective of this study is to update and develop a method for using streamflow predictive data to support adaptive reservoir operation with the aim of mitigating the 2011 flood. The study area was the Chao Phraya River Basin, one of the most important basins in Thailand. We obtained predictive information from a hydrological model with a reservoir operation module using an ensemble of seasonal precipitation data from the European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts (ECMWF). The six-month ECMWF prediction period was used to support the operation plan for mitigating flooding in 2011 around each reservoir during the wet season. Decision-making for reservoir operation based on seasonal predictions was conducted on a monthly time scale. The results showed that peak river discharge decreased slightly, by around 4%, when seasonal predictive data were used. Moreover, changing the reservoir operation plan and using seasonal predictions decreased the peak river discharge by around 20%.","[Kompor, Wongnarin; Yoshikawa, Sayaka; Kanae, Shinjiro] Tokyo Inst Technol, Dept Civil & Environm Engn, Sch Environm & Soc, Meguro Ku, 2-12-1-M1-6 Ookayama, Tokyo 1528552, Japan; [Yoshikawa, Sayaka] Ibaraki Univ, Global & Local Environm Cocreat Inst GLEC, 2-2-35 Sakuragawa, Mito, Ibaraki 3100801, Japan",,"Kompor, W (corresponding author), Tokyo Inst Technol, Dept Civil & Environm Engn, Sch Environm & Soc, Meguro Ku, 2-12-1-M1-6 Ookayama, Tokyo 1528552, Japan.",kompor.w.aa@m.titech.ac.jp; yoshikawa.s.ad@m.titech.ac.jp; kanae@cv.titech.ac.jp,"Kanae, Shinjiro/E-5606-2010","Kanae, Shinjiro/0000-0002-3176-4957; Yoshikawa, Sayaka/0000-0002-0384-9937","Japan Society for Promotion of Science (JSPS)Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology, Japan (MEXT)Japan Society for the Promotion of Science [16H06291]",This research was supported by Japan Society for Promotion of Science (JSPS) Grant-in-Aid for Scientific Research (JSPS KAKENHI Grant Numbers 16H06291).,,37,2,3,3,4,MDPI,BASEL,"ST ALBAN-ANLAGE 66, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND",,2073-4441,,WATER-SUI,Water,NOV,2020,12,11,,,,,,,3210,10.3390/w12113210,,,19,Environmental Sciences; Water Resources,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),Environmental Sciences & Ecology; Water Resources,OY4RT,WOS:000594236700001,,gold,,,2022-02-17

An enhanced forecasting method using a process-based model and spatially distributed wireless sensor data offers more accurate runoff forecasts. In this paper, we assessed the forecasting accuracy of these two forecasting methods by applying them to two tributaries within the North Fork Feather River basin in California. The result shows the enhanced forecasting method having better accuracy than the statistical model. In addition, a hydropower simulation showed a considerable increase in energy value with the enhanced forecasting informing reservoir operations.

In response, we developed and deployed a real-time iterative water temperature forecasting system (FLARE-Forecasting Lake And Reservoir Ecosystems). FLARE is composed of water temperature and meteorology sensors that wirelessly stream data, a data assimilation algorithm that uses sensor observations to update predictions from a hydrodynamic model and calibrate model parameters, and an ensemble-based forecasting algorithm to generate forecasts that include uncertainty. Importantly, FLARE quantifies the contribution of different sources of uncertainty (driver data, initial conditions, model process, and parameters) to each daily forecast of water temperature at multiple depths. We applied FLARE to Falling Creek Reservoir (Vinton, Virginia, USA), a drinking water supply, during a 475-day period encompassing stratified and mixed thermal conditions. Aggregated across this period, root mean square error (RMSE) of daily forecasted water temperatures was 1.13 degrees C at the reservoir's near-surface (1.0 m) for 7-day ahead forecasts and 1.62 degrees C for 16-day ahead forecasts. The RMSE of forecasted water temperatures at the near-sediments (8.0 m) was 0.87 degrees C for 7-day forecasts and 1.20 degrees C for 16-day forecasts. FLARE successfully predicted the onset of fall turnover 4-14 days in advance in two sequential years. Uncertainty partitioning identified meteorology driver data as the dominant source of uncertainty in forecasts for most depths and thermal conditions, except for the near-sediments in summer, when model process uncertainty dominated. Overall, FLARE provides an open-source system for lake and reservoir water quality forecasting to improve real-time management.","[Thomas, R.

The most important climate indices are identified by looking at yearly correlations between a set of 40 indices and meteorological data (precipitation and temperature) at the watershed scale. A linear model is then constructed to identify precipitation and temperature anomalies to induce perturbations in the stochastic weather generator. Time windows of 5, 10, 15, 20 and 30 years are used in determining the optimal linear model. The performance of the proposed approach is assessed against that of a resampling of past climatology and using the same stochastic weather generator unconditioned on climate indices. Each member of the ensemble weather forecast is then fed to a hydrological model to create the Ensemble Streamflow Forecasts (ESF) with a one-year forecasting horizon. The three approaches are tested in hindcast mode over a 30-year period at 12 forecast dates. Results show that temperatures are significantly correlated with large-scale climate indices, whereas precipitation is only weakly related to the same indices. The length of the time window has a considerable impact on the prediction ability of the linear models. The precipitation models based on short duration time windows performed better than those based on longer windows, while the reverse was found for the temperature models. A comparison between all three Ensemble Streamflow Forecast approaches is assessed using the Continuous Ranked Probability Score (CRPS) metric. Results show that the proposed method improves long-term streamflow forecasting, particularly the volumetric bias and the peak flows during the spring flood.","[Sohrabi, Samaneh; Brissette, Francois P.; Arsenault, Richard] Univ Quebec, Dept Construct Engn, Ecole Technol Super, 1100 Rue Ouest, Notre Dame, PQ H3C 1K3, Canada",,"Sohrabi, S (corresponding author), Univ Quebec, Dept Construct Engn, Ecole Technol Super, 1100 Rue Ouest, Notre Dame, PQ H3C 1K3, Canada.",sohrabie-molla-yousef.1@ens.etsmtl.ca,,,Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada (CA)Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada (NSERC),This work was supported by Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada (CA),,102,2,2,1,2,ELSEVIER,AMSTERDAM,"RADARWEG 29, 1043 NX AMSTERDAM, NETHERLANDS",0022-1694,1879-2707,,J HYDROL,J.

Accurate flood forecasting can provide important information for optimal reservoir operation. Generally, the characteristic of precipitation spatial distribution is analyzed based on observation of several discreet preset stations. This cannot catch the rainstorm center all the time and will lead to deviation in the characteristic of precipitation spatial distribution. Therefore, it can hardly arrive at optimal sub-watershed delineation and flood modeling. Therefore, a novel method is proposed for analysis of characteristic of precipitation spatial distribution in consideration of rainfall distribution and the delay of rainfall-runoff concentration. Based on the analysis results of precipitation spatial distribution, several key sub-basins which have significant impact on the flood process can be recognized. And then the elaborate sub-watershed delineation and flood modeling approach is put forward consequently on these key sub-basins. The efficacy of the proposed method is estimated on the flood forecasting of Zhexi reservoir watershed. The results verify that the proposed method can significantly improve the flood forecasting precision, which can provide important decision-making basis for reservoir operation.","[Lu, Jiazheng; Guo, Jun; Yang, Li; Xu, Xunjian] State Key Lab Disaster Prevent & Reduct Power Gri, Longhua Rd, Changsha, Hunan, Peoples R China; [Lu, Jiazheng; Guo, Jun; Yang, Li; Xu, Xunjian] State Grid Hunan Elect Co, Disaster Prevent & Reduct Ctr, Longhua Rd, Changsha, Hunan, Peoples R China",,"Lu, JZ; Guo, J (corresponding author), State Key Lab Disaster Prevent & Reduct Power Gri, Longhua Rd, Changsha, Hunan, Peoples R China.; Lu, JZ; Guo, J (corresponding author), State Grid Hunan Elect Co, Disaster Prevent & Reduct Ctr, Longhua Rd, Changsha, Hunan, Peoples R China.",lujz1969@126.com; freeros@foxmail.com,,,Science and Technology Key Project of State Grid Hunan Electric Power Corporation of China [5216A514003Z],This work was supported by the Science and Technology Key Project of State Grid Hunan Electric Power Corporation of China (Grant No. 5216A514003Z).

The CVQR model integrates techniques for vine copulas and quantile regression into a framework that can effectively establish relationships between the multidimensional response-independent variables as well as capture the upper tail or asymmetric dependence (i.e., upper extreme values). The CVQR model is applied to the Xiangxi River basin that is located in the Three Gorges Reservoir area in China for monthly streamflow forecasting. Multiple linear regression (MLR) and artificial neural network (ANN) are also compared to illustrate the applicability of CVQR. The results show that the CVQR model performs best in the calibration period for monthly streamflow prediction. The results also indicate that MLR has the worst effects in extreme quantile (flood events) and confidence interval predictions. Moreover, the performance of ANN tends to be overestimated in the process of peak prediction. Notably, CVQR is the most effective at capturing upper tail dependences among the hydrometeorological variables (i.e., floods). These findings are very helpful to decision-makers in hydrological process identification and water resource management practices.","[Li, Huawei; Gao, Pangpang] North China Elect Power Univ, Sino Canada Energy & Environm Res Ctr, Beijing 102206, Peoples R China; [Li, Huawei; Li, Yongping] Beijing Normal Univ, Sch Environm, State Key Joint Lab Environm Simulat & Pollut Con, Beijing 100875, Peoples R China; [Huang, Guohe; Li, Yongping] Univ Regina, Inst Energy Environm & Sustainable Communities, Regina, SK S4S 7H9, Canada; [Sun, Jie] Xiamen Univ Technol, Sch Environm Sci & Engn, Xiamen 361024, Peoples R China",,"Li, YP (corresponding author), Beijing Normal Univ, Sch Environm, State Key Joint Lab Environm Simulat & Pollut Con, Beijing 100875, Peoples R China.; Li, YP (corresponding author), Univ Regina, Inst Energy Environm & Sustainable Communities, Regina, SK S4S 7H9, Canada.",hwlee121@163.com; huang@iseis.org; yongping.li@iseis.org; sunj@xmut.edu.cn; 17755837728@163.com,,,Strategic Priority Research Program of Chinese Academy of SciencesChinese Academy of Sciences [XDA20060302],This research was supported by the Strategic Priority Research Program of Chinese Academy of Sciences (Grant Number: XDA20060302).,,67,1,1,10,13,MDPI,BASEL,"ST ALBAN-ANLAGE 66, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND",,2071-1050,,SUSTAINABILITY-BASEL,Sustainability,MAY,2021,13,9,,,,,,,4627,10.3390/su13094627,,,22,Green & Sustainable Science & Technology; Environmental Sciences; Environmental Studies,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Science & Technology - Other Topics; Environmental Sciences & Ecology,SC8OJ,WOS:000650922700001,,gold,,,2022-02-17

Strategic and parsimonious fresh water-use in water-scarce areas such as Southern New Mexico is crucially important. Elephant Butte and Caballo reservoirs are two integrated reservoirs in this region that provide water supply for many water users in downstream areas. Since Elephant Butte Reservoir is in a semi-arid region, it would be rational to utilize other energy sources such as wind energy to produce electricity and use the water supply to other critical demands in terms of time and availability. This study develops a strategy of optimal management of two integrated reservoirs to quantify the savable volume of water sources through optimal operation management. To optimize operations for the Elephant Butte and Caballo reservoirs as an integrated reservoir operation in New Mexico, the authors in this case study utilized two autoregressive integrated moving average models, one non-seasonal (daily, ARIMA model) and one seasonal (monthly, SARIMA model), to predict daily and monthly inflows to the Elephant Butte Reservoir. The coefficient of determination between predicted and observed daily values and the normalized mean of absolute error (NMAE) were 0.97 and 0.09, respectively, indicating that the daily ARIMA prediction model was significantly reliable and accurate for a univariate based streamflow forecast model. The developed time series prediction models were incorporated in a decision support system, which utilizes the predicted values for a day and a month ahead and leads to save significant amount of water volume by providing the optimal release schedule from Elephant Butte into the Caballo Reservoir. The predicted daily and monthly values from the developed ARIMA prediction models were integrated successfully with the dynamic operation model, which provides the optimal operation plans. The optimal operation plan significantly minimizes the total evaporation loss from both reservoirs by providing the optimal storage levels in both reservoirs. The saved volume of the water would be considered as a significant water supply for environmental conservation actions in downstream of the Caballo Reservoir. Providing an integrated optimal management plan for two reservoirs led to save significant water sources in a region that water shortage has led to significant environmental consequences. Finally, since the models are univariate, they demonstrate an approach for reliable inflow prediction when information is limited to only streamflow values. We find that hydroelectric power generation forces the region to lose significant amount of water to evaporation and therefore hinder the optimal use of freshwater. Based on these findings, we conclude that a water scarce region like Southern New Mexico should gain independence from hydroelectric power and save the freshwater for supporting ecosystem services and environmental purposes.","[Sabzi, Hamed Zamani; Dilekli, Naci] Univ Oklahoma, Dept Geog & Environm Sustainabil, Norman, OK 73019 USA; [Abudu, Shalamu] New Mexico Interstate Stream Commiss, Albuquerque, NM USA; [Alizadeh, Reza] Univ Oklahoma, Syst Realizat Lab, Norman, OK 73019 USA; [Soltanisehat, Leili] Old Dominion Univ, Dept Engn Management & Syst Engn, Norfolk, VA 23529 USA; [King, James Phillip] New Mexico State Univ, Dept Civil Engn, Las Cruces, NM 88003 USA",,"Sabzi, HZ (corresponding author), Univ Oklahoma, Dept Geog & Environm Sustainabil, Norman, OK 73019 USA.",hamedzs@ou.edu,"Soltanisehat, Leili/AAC-5043-2020; Alizadeh, Reza/V-9942-2017","Soltanisehat, Leili/0000-0003-4307-5814; Alizadeh, Reza/0000-0002-7705-8943; Dilekli, Naci/0000-0003-3191-5230",,,,22,12,12,2,20,TAYLOR & FRANCIS INC,PHILADELPHIA,"530 WALNUT STREET, STE 850, PHILADELPHIA, PA 19106 USA",1556-7036,1556-7230,,ENERG SOURCE PART A,Energy Sources Part A-Recovery Util.

These oligomictic lakes are experiencing a decrease in the frequency of winter full turnover and an intensification of stability. As a result, hypolimnetic oxygen concentrations are decreasing and nutrients are accumulating in bottom water, with effects on the whole ecosystem functioning. Forecasting the future evolution of the mixing pattern is relevant to assess if a reduction in GHG releases would be able to revert such processes. The study focuses on Lake Maggiore, for which the thermal structure evolution under climate change in the 2016-2085 period was assessed through numerical simulations, performed with the General Lake Model (GLM). Different prospects of regional air temperature rise were considered, given by the Swiss Climate Change Scenarios CH2011. Multiple realisations were performed for each scenario to obtain robust statistical predictions, adopting random series of meteorological data produced with the Vector-Autoregressive Weather Generator (VG). Results show that a reversion in the increasing thermal stability would be possible only if global GHG emissions started to be reduced by similar to 2020, allowing an equilibrium mixing regime to be restored by the end of the twenty-first century. Otherwise, persistent lack of complete-mixing, severe water warming and extensive effects on water quality are to be expected for the centuries to come.

A decrease in soil moisture content in the late October along with a decrease in the maximal freezing depth in the major portion of the basin increases water losses during thaws and at the early stages of spring flood. At a considerable decrease in the water equivalent of snow cover along with an appreciable increase in water losses, spring flood will not occur in some years.

Global warming increases the duration and frequency of days with high temperatures and extreme precipitation events. Therefore, it is crucial to accurately predict the inflow rate for water resource management because it helps plan for flood, drought, and power generation in the Seoul metropolitan area. However, the lack of hydrological data for the Soyang River Dam causes a physical-based model to predict the inflow rate inaccurately. This study uses nearly 15 years of meteorological, dam, and weather warning data to overcome the lack of hydrological data and predict the inflow rate over two days. In addition, a sequence-to-sequence (Seq2Seq) mechanism combined with a bidirectional long short-term memory (LSTM) is developed to predict the inflow rate. The proposed model exhibits state-of-the-art prediction accuracy with root mean square error (RMSE) of 44.17 m(3)/s and 58.59 m(3)/s, mean absolute error (MAE) of 14.94 m(3)/s and 17.11 m(3)/s, and Nash-Sutcliffe efficiency (NSE) of 0.96 and 0.94, for forecasting first and second day, respectively.","[Lee, Sangwon] Sungkyunkwan Univ, Dept Appl Data Sci, Suwon 16419, South Korea; [Kim, Jaekwang] Sungkyunkwan Univ, Sch Convergence, Seoul 03063, South Korea",,"Kim, J (corresponding author), Sungkyunkwan Univ, Sch Convergence, Seoul 03063, South Korea.",lee1465@skku.edu; linux@skku.edu,,"Kim, Jaekwang/0000-0001-5174-0074","National Research Foundation of Korea (NRF) - Korean government (MSIT) [NRF-2019R1C1C1008174]; Ministry of Science and ICT (MSIT), Korea, under the ICT Creative Consilience program [IITP-2020-0-01821]","This work was supported by a National Research Foundation of Korea (NRF) grant funded by the Korean government (MSIT) (No. NRF-2019R1C1C1008174) and by the Ministry of Science and ICT (MSIT), Korea, under the ICT Creative Consilience program (IITP-2020-0-01821), supervised by the Institute for Information & Communications Technology Planning & Evaluation (IITP).",,41,2,2,8,8,MDPI,BASEL,"ST ALBAN-ANLAGE 66, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND",,2073-4441,,WATER-SUI,Water,SEP,2021,13,17,,,,,,,2447,10.3390/w13172447,,,25,Environmental Sciences; Water Resources,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),Environmental Sciences & Ecology; Water Resources,UP8EM,WOS:000695607200001,,gold,,,2022-02-17

Water quality forecasting in arid river basins is especially challenging given the importance of protecting beneficial uses in these environments and the livelihood of agricultural communities. In the agriculture-dominated San Joaquin River Basin of California, real-time salinity management (RTSM) is a state-sanctioned program that helps to maximize allowable salt export while protecting existing basin beneficial uses of water supply. The RTSM strategy supplants the federal total maximum daily load (TMDL) approach that could impose fines associated with exceedances of monthly and annual salt load allocations of up to $1 million per year based on average year hydrology and salt load export limits. The essential components of the current program include the establishment of telemetered sensor networks, a web-based information system for sharing data, a basin-scale salt load assimilative capacity forecasting model and institutional entities tasked with performing weekly forecasts of river salt assimilative capacity and scheduling west-side drainage export of salt loads. Web-based information portals have been developed to share model input data and salt assimilative capacity forecasts together with increasing stakeholder awareness and involvement in water quality resource management activities in the river basin. Two modeling approaches have been developed simultaneously. The first relies on a statistical analysis of the relationship between flow and salt concentration at three compliance monitoring sites and the use of these regression relationships for forecasting. The second salt load forecasting approach is a customized application of the Watershed Analysis Risk Management Framework (WARMF), a watershed water quality simulation model that has been configured to estimate daily river salt assimilative capacity and to provide decision support for real-time salinity management at the watershed level. Analysis of the results from both model-based forecasting approaches over a period of five years shows that the regression-based forecasting model, run daily Monday to Friday each week, provided marginally better performance. However, the regression-based forecasting model assumes the same general relationship between flow and salinity which breaks down during extreme weather events such as droughts when water allocation cutbacks among stakeholders are not evenly distributed across the basin. A recent test case shows the utility of both models in dealing with an exceedance event at one compliance monitoring site recently introduced in 2020.","[Quinn, Nigel W.

Yet, forecasts of anticipated temperature effects on fishes of different thermal guilds are lacking, especially in freshwater ecosystems. Towards this end, we used spatially explicit, growth rate potential (GRP) models to project changes in seasonal habitat quality for a warm-water piscivore (largemouth bass Micropterus salmoides), a cool-water piscivore (walleye Sander vitreus) and a hybrid piscivore (saugeye S. vitreus x S. canadensis) in two Midwestern reservoirs. We assessed habitat quality for two periods (early and middle 21st century) under two realistic greenhouse gas emission scenarios (a mid-century emissions peak and a rapid continuous increase in emissions). Largemouth bass were projected to experience enhanced or slightly reduced habitat during all seasons, and throughout the mid-21st century. By contrast, walleye habitat was projected to decline with anticipated warming, except during the spring in the smaller of our two study reservoirs and during the fall in the larger of our two study reservoirs. Saugeye habitat was projected to either increase modestly or decline slightly during the spring and fall and declines in habitat quality and quantity that were smaller than those for walleye were identified during summer. Collectively, our findings indicate that climate warming will differentially alter habitat suitability for reservoir piscivores, favouring warm-water species over cool-water species. We expect these changes in habitat quality to impact the dynamics of reservoir fish populations to varying degrees necessitating the consideration of climate when making future management decisions.","[Budnik, Richard R.; Ludsin, Stuart A.; Marschall, Elizabeth A.] Ohio State Univ, Aquat Ecol Lab, Dept Evolut Ecol & Organismal Biol, 1314 Kinnear Rd,230 Res Ctr, Columbus, OH 43212 USA; [Conroy, Joseph D.] Ohio Dept Nat Resources, Div Wildlife Inland Fisheries Res Unit, Hebron, OH USA; [Zweifel, Richard D.] Ohio Dept Nat Resources, Div Wildlife, Columbus, OH USA",,"Budnik, RR (corresponding author), Ohio State Univ, Aquat Ecol Lab, Dept Evolut Ecol & Organismal Biol, 1314 Kinnear Rd,230 Res Ctr, Columbus, OH 43212 USA.",budnik.3@osu.edu,"Conroy, Joseph David/C-4463-2008; Marschall, Elizabeth/A-1608-2014","Conroy, Joseph David/0000-0002-9561-7294; Budnik, Richard/0000-0003-4639-8563; Marschall, Elizabeth/0000-0002-8026-4203","Ohio Department of Natural Resources, Division of Wildlife: Federal Aid in Sport Fish Restoration Project [F-69-P]","Ohio Department of Natural Resources, Division of Wildlife: Federal Aid in Sport Fish Restoration Project, Grant/Award Number: F-69-P",,85,3,3,3,18,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0906-6691,1600-0633,,ECOL FRESHW FISH,Ecol.

As an important source of drinking water in North China, its water quality safety determines the success or failure of a sizable water supply. At present, there is a lack of in-depth and systematic understanding of the interaction between hydrodynamics and the water environment as well as water ecological processes in the main canal at the early stages of operation. It is not currently possible to accurately predict water quality and algae status at the early stage of canal ecosystem succession. Change trends and distribution characteristics of the main water ecological environment elements in the main canal at the early MR stage are analyzed in this study. The main factors influencing algae are investigated by principal component analysis (PCA) to characterize the water quality and algae transport distribution in the main MR canal under the complex multi-sluice joint dispatching conditions. The relationship between environmental factors, hydrodynamic, water quality, and algae in the coupled canal-sluice system in the SNWDP MR is determined. Algae distributions under different water transmission conditions in a typical canal section are predicted accordingly. CODMn and algal density in the main canal are shown to increase from south to north along the canal. DO decreases from south to north; other water quality indexes do not significantly differ from north to south. Algal density along the canal differs to the greatest extent in summer, followed by spring and autumn, and is the weakest in winter. The predicted algae densities in the main canal under different water conveying conditions show that single sluice control and strong water flow from Taocha Head Section increase the flow velocity after passing through the sluice with a fixed opening. Algal density decreases flow rate increases under single sluice regulation conditions. The maximum rate of algal density change reaches 22.13% and 29.55% under double sluice and four sluice scheduling. Algae control effects grow significantly as the number of control sluices increases. The results of this work may provide technical support for water quality forecasting and algae risk warning in the SNWDP MR as well as a workable reference for similar projects.","[Jing, Zheng; Chen, Hao; Cao, Huiqun; Tang, Xianqiang; Luo, Ping'an; Luo, Huiping] Changjiang River Sci Res Inst, Watershed Water Environm Inst, Wuhan 430010, Peoples R China; [Jing, Zheng; Cao, Huiqun; Tang, Xianqiang; Luo, Ping'an; Luo, Huiping] Hubei Key Lab Watershed Water Resources & Ecol En, Wuhan 430010, Peoples R China; [Cao, Huiqun; Shang, Yuming] Construct & Adm Bur Middle Route, South To North Water Divers Project, Beijing 100038, Peoples R China; [Cao, Huiqun; Liang, Yuhan] Hohai Univ, Sch Hydrol & Water Resources, Nanjing 210098, Peoples R China",,"Cao, HQ (corresponding author), Changjiang River Sci Res Inst, Watershed Water Environm Inst, Wuhan 430010, Peoples R China.; Cao, HQ (corresponding author), Hubei Key Lab Watershed Water Resources & Ecol En, Wuhan 430010, Peoples R China.; Cao, HQ (corresponding author), Construct & Adm Bur Middle Route, South To North Water Divers Project, Beijing 100038, Peoples R China.; Cao, HQ (corresponding author), Hohai Univ, Sch Hydrol & Water Resources, Nanjing 210098, Peoples R China.",caohuiqun@163.com,,,"National Natural Science Foundation of ChinaNational Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC) [51909009]; Fundamental Research Funds for Central Public Welfare Research Institutes [CKSF 2019198/SH, CKSF 2019498/SH]; China National Critical Project for Science and Technology on Water Pollution Prevention and Control [2017ZX07108-001]","This paper is supported by the National Natural Science Foundation of China (51909009), the Fundamental Research Funds for Central Public Welfare Research Institutes (Grant No. CKSF 2019198/SH; Grant No. CKSF 2019498/SH), China National Critical Project for Science and Technology on Water Pollution Prevention and Control (No. 2017ZX07108-001).",,46,0,0,18,18,SPRINGER HEIDELBERG,HEIDELBERG,"TIERGARTENSTRASSE 17, D-69121 HEIDELBERG, GERMANY",0944-1344,1614-7499,,ENVIRON SCI POLLUT R,Environ.

A number of uses (drinking water, irrigation, hydropower horizontal ellipsis ) can be strongly affected by water shortages. Therefore, there is a need for the early anticipation of low-flow periods to improve water management. This is strengthened by the perspective of having more severe low flows in the context of climate change. Several French institutions have been collaborating over the last years to develop an operational tool for low-flow forecasting, called PREMHYCE. It was tested in real time on more than one hundred catchments in continental France since 2017. PREMHYCE includes five hydrological models, which are calibrated on gauged catchments and which assimilate flow observations. Low-flow forecasts can be issued up to 90 days ahead, based on Ensemble Streamflow Prediction (ESP) using historical climatic data as ensembles of future input scenarios. The performance of the forecasting tool is analysed on the 2017-2018 low flows on 38 catchments for which forecasts are available for all the models. The capacity to anticipate low-flow events shows an average anticipation of 40 days. The short-term forecast (7 days ahead) is good for most of the models.","[Tilmant, Francois; Nicolle, Pierre; Bourgin, Francois; Delaigue, Olivier; Perrin, Charles] Univ Paris Saclay, UR HYCAR, INRAE, Antony, France; [Besson, Francois; Etchevers, Pierre; Rousset, Fabienne] Meteo France, Direct Climatol, Toulouse, France; [Francois, Didier] Univ Lorraine, LOTERR, Metz, France; [Le Lay, Matthieu] EDF DTG, Grenoble, France; [Thiery, Dominique] Bur Rech Geol & Minieres, Orleans, France; [Magand, Claire; Leurent, Timothee] Off Francais Biodiversite OFB, Vincennes, France; [Jacob, Elise] Minist Transit Ecol, Direct Eau & Biodiversite, La Def, France; [Nicolle, Pierre] Univ Gustave Eiffel, GERS LEE, Bouguenais, France; [Leurent, Timothee] Agence Eau Adour Garonne, Toulouse, France",,"Perrin, C (corresponding author), Univ Paris Saclay, UR HYCAR, INRAE, Antony, France.",charles.perrin@inrae.fr,"THIERY, Dominique/AAK-9096-2020; Bourgin, François/F-8534-2013","THIERY, Dominique/0000-0002-1757-5308; Bourgin, François/0000-0002-2820-7260; Tilmant, Francois/0000-0003-3115-9535; Delaigue, Olivier/0000-0002-7668-8468",,,,25,0,0,0,3,EDP SCIENCES S A,LES ULIS CEDEX A,"17, AVE DU HOGGAR, PA COURTABOEUF, BP 112, F-91944 LES ULIS CEDEX A, FRANCE",0018-6368,1958-5551,,HOUILLE BLANCHE,Houille Blanche-Rev.

Tools to slow the proliferation of aquatic invasive species are still needed to guide the allocation of limited resources more effectively and efficiently once a species is already established. Here we develop mechanistic models to recreate the invasion history of the rusty crayfish Faxonius rusticus in the John Day River (JDR) basin, forecast its future distribution, and evaluate the management efficiency of, and trade-offs among, population control actions. Location Methods John Day River Basin, Oregon. The spread and control of rusty crayfish in the JDR was simulated with a spatially explicit individual-based model (SEIBM) whereby the life history of each crayfish in the population is modelled in response to environmental conditions that vary across space and time. The model was calibrated by comparing modelled rusty crayfish spread throughout the JDR to known occurrences according to three comprehensive surveys. Results Main conclusion Our model accurately reproduced historical rusty crayfish distribution data for 2005, 2010, and 2016 with a specificity and sensitivity of similar to 80%. Leveraging this realistic model of the spread of rusty crayfish, we show that rapid management actions to the initial invasion would have resulted in an opportunity to slow the spread of rusty crayfish. We instead predict that rusty crayfish will reach the mainstem of the Columbia River by 2025, at which our model predicts that the crayfish population will number on the order of 10(8) individuals over more than 1100 km of river throughout the watershed and progress into critical salmon spawning habitat. This study demonstrates that SEIBMs can provide unique insight into the future distribution of aquatic invasive species and concretely support decision-makers in choosing an optimal control strategy.","[Messager, Mathis L.; Olden, Julian D.] Univ Washington, Te Punaha Matatini, Seattle, WA 98195 USA",,"Messager, ML (corresponding author), Univ Washington, Te Punaha Matatini, Seattle, WA 98195 USA.",messamat@uw.edu,"Olden, Julian D/A-8535-2010","Olden, Julian/0000-0003-2143-1187; Messager, Mathis/0000-0002-3051-8068",Society for Freshwater Science; Crustacean Society; School of Aquatic and Fishery Sciences; University of WashingtonUniversity of Washington,Society for Freshwater Science; The Crustacean Society; School of Aquatic and Fishery Sciences; University of Washington,,53,15,16,2,17,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",1366-9516,1472-4642,,DIVERS DISTRIB,Divers.

Here an analysis of hydroclimatic changes in the Fraser and Athabasca River basins in western Canada is presented, based on an ensemble of climate projections, which have been dynamically downscaled to 10-km resolution using the Weather Research and Forecasting Model in two configurations. The GCM ensemble comprises four independent integrations of the Community Earth System Model under the representative concentration pathway 8.5. Basin-integrated changes in the seasonal cycle of hydroclimatic variables, and the variability of water supply and flood and drought risk, are considered. It is found that fall and winter precipitation generally increase by 20%-30% toward the end of the century, while changes in summer precipitation are smaller and associated with high model uncertainty. Furthermore, a reduction in snowfall and an increase in evapotranspiration are projected. However, projected impacts on water resources east and west of the Rocky Mountains are quite different: in basins closer to the coast (west of the Rocky Mountains) higher temperatures lead to a transition from predominantly solid to liquid precipitation and a significantly weaker spring freshet, followed by drier summers. In the lee of the Rocky Mountains the spring freshet remains largely unaffected and in summer the increase in evapotranspiration (ET) is compensated by increasing precipitation, so that water balance changes appear to be small. It is further found that a shift in runoff seasonality near the coast may lead to significantly increased flood risk in fall.","[Erler, Andre R.; Peltier, W.

Although understanding the water cycle is key for addressing climate change issues, it is difficult to obtain high spatial- and temporal-resolution observations of hydroclimatic processes, especially in remote regions. Climate models are useful tools for dissecting and diagnosing these processes, especially the convection-permitting (CP) high-resolution regional climate simulation, which provides advantages over lower-resolution models by explicitly representing convection. In addition to better representing convective systems, higher spatial resolution also better represents topography, mountain meteorology, and highly heterogeneous geophysical features. However, there is little work with convection-permitting regional climate models conducted over western Canada. Focusing on the Mackenzie River and Saskatchewan River basins, this study investigated the surface water budget and atmospheric moisture balance in historical and representative concentration pathway (RCP8.5) projections using 4 km CP Weather Research and Forecasting (WRF). We compared the high-resolution 4 km CP WRF and three common reanalysis datasets, namely the North American Regional Reanalysis (NARR), the Japanese 55-year Reanalysis (JRA-55), and European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts reanalysis interim dataset (ERA-Interim). High-resolution WRF outperforms the reanalyses in balancing the surface water budget in both river basins with much lower residual terms. For the pseudo-global-warming scenario at the end of the 21st century with representative concentration pathway (RCP8.5) radiative forcing, both the Mackenzie River and Saskatchewan River basins show increases in the amplitude for precipitation and evapotranspiration and a decrease in runoff. The Saskatchewan River basin (SRB) shows a moderate increase in precipitation in the west and a small decrease in the east. Combined with a significant increase in evapotranspiration in a warmer climate, the Saskatchewan River basin would have a larger deficit of water resources than in the current climate based on the pseudo-global-warming (PGW) simulation. The high-resolution simulation also shows that the difference of atmospheric water vapour balance in the two river basins is due to flow orientation and topography differences at the western boundaries of the two basins. The sensitivity of water vapour balance to fine-scale topography and atmospheric processes shown in this study demonstrates that high-resolution dynamical downscaling is important for large-scale water balance and hydrological cycles.","[Kurkute, Sopan; Li, Yanping] Univ Saskatchewan, Sch Environm & Sustainabil, Saskatoon, SK, Canada; [Li, Zhenhua; Li, Yanping; Huo, Fei] Univ Saskatchewan, Global Inst Water Secur, Saskatoon, SK, Canada",,"Li, YP (corresponding author), Univ Saskatchewan, Sch Environm & Sustainabil, Saskatoon, SK, Canada.; Li, ZH; Li, YP (corresponding author), Univ Saskatchewan, Global Inst Water Secur, Saskatoon, SK, Canada.",zhenhua.li@usask.ca; yanping.li@usask.ca,"Huo, Fei/AAE-7664-2019","Huo, Fei/0000-0002-4135-795X",Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada (NSERC)Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada (NSERC); Changing Cold Regions Network (CCRN); Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada (Global Water Futures)Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada (NSERC); NSERC Discovery GrantNatural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada (NSERC),"This research has been supported by the Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada (NSERC), the Changing Cold Regions Network (CCRN), the Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada (Global Water Futures), and the NSERC Discovery Grant.",,37,8,8,3,8,COPERNICUS GESELLSCHAFT MBH,GOTTINGEN,"BAHNHOFSALLEE 1E, GOTTINGEN, 37081, GERMANY",1027-5606,1607-7938,,HYDROL EARTH SYST SC,Hydrol.

Up to now, forecast products focus on atmospheric variables, such as precipitation, air temperature and, in hydrology, on river discharge. Considering the full terrestrial system from groundwater across the land surface into the atmosphere, a number of important hydrologic variables are missing especially with regard to the shallow and deeper subsurface (e.g., groundwater), which are gaining considerable attention in the context of global change. In this study, we propose a terrestrial monitoring/forecasting system using the Terrestrial Systems Modeling Platform (TSMP) that predicts all essential states and fluxes of the terrestrial hydrologic and energy cycles from groundwater into the atmosphere. Closure of the terrestrial cycles provides a physically consistent picture of the terrestrial system in TSMP. TSMP has been implemented over a regional domain over North Rhine-Westphalia and a continental domain over Europe in a real-time forecast/monitoring workflow. Applying a real-time forecasting/monitoring workflow over both domains, experimental forecasts are being produced with different lead times since the beginning of 2016. Real-time forecast/monitoring products encompass all compartments of the terrestrial system including additional hydrologic variables, such as plant available soil water, groundwater table depth, and groundwater recharge and storage.","[Kollet, Stefan; Gasper, Fabian; Goergen, Klaus; Hendricks-Franssen, Harrie-Jan; Keune, Jessica; Kurtz, Wolfgang] Forschungszentrum Julich, Inst Biogeosci IBG 3, Agrosphere, D-52425 Julich, Germany; [Kollet, Stefan; Gasper, Fabian; Brdar, Slavko; Goergen, Klaus; Hendricks-Franssen, Harrie-Jan; Keune, Jessica; Kurtz, Wolfgang; Simmer, Clemens] Geoverbund ABC J, Ctr High Performance Sci Comp, D-52425 Julich, Germany; [Brdar, Slavko] Forschungszentrum Julich, Julich Supercomp Ctr, D-52425 Julich, Germany; [Keune, Jessica; Kuell, Volker; Poll, Stefan; Troemel, Silke; Shrestha, Prabhakar; Simmer, Clemens; Sulis, Mauro] Univ Bonn, Meteorol Inst, D-53121 Bonn, Germany; [Pappenberger, Florian] European Ctr Medium Range Weather Forecasts, Forecast Dept, Reading RG2 9AX, Berks, England; [Gasper, Fabian] CISS TDI GmbH, Sinzig, Germany; [Keune, Jessica] Univ Ghent, Dept Environm, Ghent, Belgium; [Kurtz, Wolfgang] Leibniz Supercomp Ctr, Environm Comp Grp, Garching, Germany; [Sulis, Mauro] Luxembourg Inst Sci & Technol, Dept Environm Res & Innovat, Luxembourg, Luxembourg",,"Kollet, S (corresponding author), Forschungszentrum Julich, Inst Biogeosci IBG 3, Agrosphere, D-52425 Julich, Germany.; Kollet, S (corresponding author), Geoverbund ABC J, Ctr High Performance Sci Comp, D-52425 Julich, Germany.",s.kollet@fz-juelich.de; fabian.gasper@googlemail.com; s.brdar@fz-juelich.de; k.goergen@fz-juelich.de; h.hendricks-franssen@fz-juelich.de; Jessica.Keune@UGent.be; Wolfgang.Kurtz@lrz.de; vkuell@uni-bonn.de; florian.pappenberger@ecmwf.int; stefan.poll@uni-bonn.de; silke.troemel@uni-bonn.de; pshrestha@uni-bonn.de; csimmer@uni-bonn.de; mauro.sulis@list.lu,"Shrestha, Prabhakar/F-8964-2014; Shrestha, Prabhakar/AAR-3846-2020; Goergen, Klaus/A-4655-2017; Franssen, Harrie-Jan Hendricks/B-1781-2008; Simmer, Clemens J/M-4949-2013; Kurtz, Wolfgang/AAH-2299-2019; Hendricks-Franssen, Harrie-Jan/AAD-9603-2022; Pappenberger, Florian/A-2839-2009; Troemel, Silke/AAL-4335-2020","Shrestha, Prabhakar/0000-0002-0840-0717; Shrestha, Prabhakar/0000-0002-0840-0717; Goergen, Klaus/0000-0002-4208-3444; Simmer, Clemens J/0000-0003-3001-8642; Kurtz, Wolfgang/0000-0002-8547-4146; Hendricks-Franssen, Harrie-Jan/0000-0002-0004-8114; Pappenberger, Florian/0000-0003-1766-2898; Sulis, Mauro/0000-0002-3149-4096; Kollet, Stefan/0000-0003-0095-1554; Keune, Jessica/0000-0001-6104-2165","SFB/TR32 Patterns in Soil-Vegetation-Atmosphere Systems: Monitoring, Modeling and Data Assimilation Project - Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft (DFG); TERENO","This research work was supported by the SFB/TR32 Patterns in Soil-Vegetation-Atmosphere Systems: Monitoring, Modeling and Data Assimilation Project funded by the Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft (DFG) and TERENO.",,35,9,9,0,5,MDPI,BASEL,"ST ALBAN-ANLAGE 66, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND",2073-4441,,,WATER-SUI,Water,NOV,2018,10,11,,,,,,,1697,10.3390/w10111697,,,17,Environmental Sciences; Water Resources,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),Environmental Sciences & Ecology; Water Resources,HC3XM,WOS:000451736300204,,"Green Published, Green Submitted, gold",,,2022-02-17

Taking the Wei River Basin (WRB) of China as an example, streamflow in six hydrometric stations from the main stream of the WRB is used to validate the model. The results show that the proposed model have good prediction skills, and the prediction results of multistage models are better than single-stage models; however, the most complex models do not have the best results. The VMD also preformed better prediction skills than ICEEMD, and the optimal model was VCL (VMD-CNN-LSTM).

This study proposed a simple yet efficient approach, the Bivar_update model that utilizes bivariate climate forecast to update individual probabilities of the ensemble streamflow prediction. The Bayesian updating scheme is used to update the joint probability mass function derived from historic precipitation and temperature data sets. Thirty-five dam basins were used for the case study, and the modified Tank model was embedded into the ensemble streamflow prediction framework. The performance of the proposed approach was evaluated through a comparison with a reference streamflow forecast model, the Univar_update model, that reflects only precipitation forecast, in terms of deterministic and categorical streamflow forecast accuracy. For this purpose, multiple cases of probabilistic precipitation and temperature forecasts were synthetically generated. As a result, the Bivar_update model was able to decrease the errors in forecast under below-normal conditions. The improvements in forecasting skills were found for both measures; deterministic and categorical streamflow forecasts. Since the proposed Bivar_update model reflects both precipitation and temperature information, it can compensate low predictability especially under dry conditions in which the streamflow's dependency on temperature increases.","[Sung, Jang Hyun] Minist Environm, Han River Flood Control Off, Seoul 06501, South Korea; [Ryu, Young] Natl Inst Meteorol Sci, Earth Syst Res Div, Jeju 63568, South Korea; [Seo, Seung Beom] Univ Seoul, Int Sch Urban Sci, Seoul 02504, South Korea",,"Seo, SB (corresponding author), Univ Seoul, Int Sch Urban Sci, Seoul 02504, South Korea.",jhsung1@korea.kr; youngryu@korea.kr; sbseo7@uos.ac.kr,,"Seo, Seung Beom/0000-0001-9819-6555",Young Researchers program - National Research Foundation of Korea [NRF-2017R1A6A3A11031800],This research was funded by the Young Researchers program [NRF-2017R1A6A3A11031800] funded by the National Research Foundation of Korea.,,45,2,2,1,2,MDPI,BASEL,"ST ALBAN-ANLAGE 66, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND",,2071-1050,,SUSTAINABILITY-BASEL,Sustainability,APR,2020,12,7,,,,,,,2905,10.3390/su12072905,,,24,Green & Sustainable Science & Technology; Environmental Sciences; Environmental Studies,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Science & Technology - Other Topics; Environmental Sciences & Ecology,LL4WR,WOS:000531558100330,,gold,,,2022-02-17

Overlaid on increasing global temperatures, human populations are expected to grow, which will increase anthropogenic nutrient enrichment in freshwater ecosystems. Florida (US) represents the equatorial range limit for many freshwater fishes, thus these species are potentially at risk to climate warming. Likewise, Florida's population is expected to aggressively expand, increasing risk for nutrient enrichment. In this study, we examined whether maximum water temperatures or trophic state indicators (a proxy for nutrient enrichment) better explains variation in Florida Bass (Micropterus salmoides floridanus) condition across 23 different Florida freshwater bodies distributed throughout the state. Florida Bass lengths and weights, temperature, and chlorophyll-alpha, total phosphorous (TP), and total nitrogen (TN) measures were collected in the late summer and fall from 2010 to 2012. We described relationships between bass relative condition and environmental measurements (temperature, and trophic state indicators) across these lake-year combinations using linear and non-linear regressions. We found no significant relationship between temperature and bass condition (r(2) = 0.01). However, we found that trophic state indicators did predict bass condition (r(2) = 0.39-0.50). Though research is needed to more rigorously assess the effects of rising temperature on bass condition, our results may suggest that lake productivity is currently an influential driver on Florida Bass. As such, management efforts should continue to closely monitor and manage water quality and potential nutrient enrichment in Florida's freshwater waters, as bass condition appears to be closely tied to lake productivity.","[Boucek, Ross] Bonefish & Tarpon Trust, Florida Keys Initiat, Marathon, FL 33050 USA; [Barrientos, Christian] Univ Florida, Program Fisheries & Aquat Sci, Sch Forest Resources & Conservat, Gainesville, FL USA; [Bush, Michael R.] Florida Int Univ, Dept Biol Sci, 11200 SW 8th St, Miami, FL 33199 USA; [Gandy, David A.] Florida Fish & Wildlife Conservat Commiss, Fish & Wildlife Res Inst, Apalachicola Bay Field Lab, Eastpoint, FL 32328 USA; [Wilson, Kyle L.] Univ Calgary, Dept Biol Sci, 2500 Univ Dr NW, Calgary, AB, Canada; [Young, Joy M.] Florida Fish & Wildlife Conservat Commiss, Fish & Wildlife Res Inst, Tequesta Field Lab, 19100 SE Fed Hwy, Tequesta, FL 33469 USA",,"Boucek, R (corresponding author), Bonefish & Tarpon Trust, Florida Keys Initiat, Marathon, FL 33050 USA.",Ross@bonefishtarpontrust.org,"Wilson, Kyle Logan/J-5800-2019","Wilson, Kyle Logan/0000-0002-0870-0509","National Science Foundation (NSF) Water, Sustainability, and Climate (WSC) program [NSF EAR-1204762]; Florida Coastal Everglades (FCE) Long Term Ecological Research (LTER) program [NSF DEB-1237517]","We would like to acknowledge Travis Tuten and the Florida Chapter of the American Fisheries Society for advising us on this entirely student lead paper.

Here, we demonstrate the relevance of biodiversity records developed through citizen-science initiatives generated outside the natural sciences academia. We used a Spanish geographical dictionary from the mid-nineteenth century to compile over 10 000 freshwater fish records, including almost 4 000 brown trout (Salmo trutta) citations, and constructed a historical presence-absence dataset covering over 2 000 10 x 10 km cells, which is comparable to present-day data. There has been a clear reduction in trout range in the past 150 years, coinciding with a generalized warming. We show that current trout distribution can be accurately predicted based on historical records and past and present values of three air temperature variables. The models indicate a consistent decline of average suitability of around 25% between 1850s and 2000s, which is expected to surpass 40% by the 2050s.

Thus, adapting the operation of existing reservoirs is indispensable to cope with alterations in flow regime. We proposed a Forecast-Based Adaptive Reservoir Operation (FARO) framework to evaluate the use of long-term climate forecasts in improving real-time reservoir operations. The FARO approach was applied to the High Aswan Dam (HAD) in the Nile River basin. Monthly precipitation and temperature forecasts at up to 12 months of lead time are used from a suite of eight North American Multi-Model Ensemble (NMME) models. The value of NMME-based forecasts to reservoir operations was compared with perfect and climatology-based forecasts over an optimization horizon of 10 years from 1993 to 2002. Our results indicated that the forecast horizon for HAD operation ranges between 5 and 12 months lead time at low- and high-demand scenarios, respectively, beyond which the forecast information no longer improves the release decision. The forecast value to HAD operation is more pronounced in the months following the flooding season (October-December). During these months, the skill of streamflow forecasts using NMME forcings outperforms the climatology-based forecasts. When considering the operation of upstream Grand Ethiopian Renaissance Dam (GERD), using streamflow forecasts minimally helps to maintain current target objectives of HAD operation and therefore result in higher operation costs as opposed to current conditions without GERD. Our study underlined the importance of deriving a new adaptive operating policy for HAD to improve the value of available forecasts while considering GERD filling and operation phases. SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT Water management in the Nile River basin is challenged by the construction of the Grand Ethiopian Renaissance Dam (GERD) in Ethiopia. Thus, it becomes important to adapt the operation of existing dams to expected alteration in upstream flow. This study aims to use long-term forecasts to improve real-time operations of the High Aswan Dam (HAD) in Egypt. Forecasting streamflow up to 8 months ahead showed a significant improvement in the HAD operation. However, when considering GERD, using forecasts could minimally help to maintain current objectives of HAD operation. Our findings underline the importance of deriving a new operating policy for HAD to improve the value of available forecasts while considering future upstream projects.","[Eldardiry, Hisham; Hossain, Faisal] Univ Washington, Dept Civil & Environm Engn, Seattle, WA 98195 USA",,"Eldardiry, H (corresponding author), Univ Washington, Dept Civil & Environm Engn, Seattle, WA 98195 USA.",dardiry@uw.edu,,,NASA Surface Water Ocean Topography mission Science Team Grant [NNX16AQ54G]; NSFNational Science Foundation (NSF) [EAR 1740042]; NASA Applied Sciences SERVIR Grant [80NSSC20K0152],"This work supported by NASA Surface Water Ocean Topography mission Science Team Grant (NNX16AQ54G), NSF EAR 1740042 titled INFEWS/T1: Linking Current and Future Hydrologic Change to Hydropower, Human Nutrition, and Livelihoods in the Lower Mekong Basin.

The streamflow series is deseasonalized at different time scale and then an appropriate nonseasonal stochastic DARMA (p, q) models are built by using the plots of Partial Auto Correlation Function (PACF) to determine the order (p) of DARMA model. Then the deseasonalized data for key stations are used as input to ANN models with lags equals to the order (p) of DARMA model. The performance of ANN and DARMA models are compared using statistical methods. The results show that the developed model (using 1/3 monthly (ten-days) and ANN) has the best performance to predict monthly streamflow at all key stations. The results also show that the relative error in the developed model result did not exceed 9% while in the traditional models reach to 68% in the flood months in the testing period.

The performance of MLR is then compared with the categorical forecasts estimated from the traditional approach, principal component regression (PCR). Results from both cross validation and split sampling reveal that in general, the probabilistic categorical forecasts from the MLR model have more accuracy and exhibit higher rank probability skill score (RPSS) compared to the PCR probabilistic forecasts. MLR forecasts are also more skillful than PCR forecasts during the winter season as well as for basins that exhibit high interannual variability in streamflows. The role of ensemble size of precipitation forecasts in developing MLR-based streamflow forecasts was also investigated. Because of its simplicity, MLR offers an alternate, reliable approach to developing categorical streamflow forecasts.","[Mazrooei, Amirhossein; Sankarasubramanian, A.] North Carolina State Univ, Dept Civil Construct & Environm Engn, Raleigh, NC 27695 USA",,"Mazrooei, A (corresponding author), North Carolina State Univ, Dept Civil Construct & Environm Engn, Raleigh, NC 27695 USA.",amazroo@ncsu.edu,"Arumugam, Sankarasubramanian/A-1929-2019","Arumugam, Sankarasubramanian/0000-0002-7668-1311","National Science FoundationNational Science Foundation (NSF) [CBET-0954405, CBET-1204368, CCF-1442909]","We thank the anonymous reviewers whose suggestions and comments helped us in improving the manuscript.

The time scale of subseasonal forecasting (from 2 weeks to 1 month) is a critical lead time for proactive mitigation of flood disasters. The NOAA Climate Testbed Subseasonal Experiment (SubX) is a research-to-operations project with almost immediate availability of forecasts. It has produced a reforecast database that facilitates evaluation of flood forecasts at these subseasonal lead times. Here, we examine the SubX-driven forecast skill of AR-related flooding out to 4-week lead using the Distributed Hydrology Soil Vegetation Model (DHSVM), with particular attention to the role of antecedent soil moisture (ASM), which modulates the relationship between meteorological and hydrological forecast skill. We study three watersheds along a transect of the U.S. West Coast: the Chehalis River basin in Washington, the Russian River basin in Northern California, and the Santa Margarita River basin in Southern California. We find that the SubX-driven flood forecast skill drops quickly after week 1, during which there is relatively high deterministic forecast skill. We find some probabilistic forecast skill relative to climatology as well as ensemble streamflow prediction (ESP) in week 2, but minimal skill in weeks 3-4, especially for annual maximum floods, notwithstanding some probabilistic skill for smaller floods in week 3. Using ESP and reverse-ESP experiments to consider the relative influence of ASM and SubX reforecast skill, we find that ASM dominates probabilistic forecast skill only for small flood events at week 1, while SubX reforecast skill dominates for large flood events at all lead times.","[Cao, Qian; Lettenmaier, Dennis P.] Univ Calif Los Angeles, Dept Geog, Los Angeles, CA 90024 USA; [Shukla, Shraddhanand] Univ Calif Santa Barbara, Santa Barbara, CA 93106 USA; [DeFlorio, Michael J.; Ralph, F.

However, nowcast, short-term, and mid-term forecasts have significant differences in their uncertainties, leading to a gap between these forecasts and their combined use. To make the most of these forecasts, this paper defines a reliable forecast horizon (RFH) and proposes a model based on the three-stage-based operation rule (Three-OR), in which the streamflow forecasts are jointly used with different levels of uncertainty. To evaluate the effectiveness and efficiency of the proposed model, it is applied to the Wan'an Reservoir located at the midstream of the Ganjiang River in China with the objectives of flood control and water utilization (i.e., hydropower generation and water supply). The results reveal the following: 1) both flood control and water utilization can be improved when compared with the current operation rule; 2) floods with a higher peak and larger volume gain more improvements using Three-OR; 3) a smaller difference in the forecast error produces better operation performance in water utilization; and 4) the extension of the RFH is beneficial for reservoir operation, as it can help to improve flood control if the flood is large; otherwise, it can help improve water utilization. In summary, the proposed model based on Three-OR can make the best use of streamflow information, thus improving the real-time reservoir operation during the flood season.","[Wang, Jiabiao; Zhao, Tongtiegang] Sun Yat Sen Univ, Sch Civil Engn, Zhuhai 519082, Peoples R China; [Wang, Jiabiao; Zhao, Jianshi; Wang, Hao] Tsinghua Univ, Dept Hydraul Engn, State Key Lab Hydrosci & Engn, Beijing 100084, Peoples R China; [Wang, Hao; Lei, Xiaohui] China Inst Water Resources & Hydropower Res, Beijing 100038, Peoples R China",,"Zhao, JS (corresponding author), Tsinghua Univ, Dept Hydraul Engn, State Key Lab Hydrosci & Engn, Beijing 100084, Peoples R China.",zhaojianshi@tsinghua.edu.cn,,,"National Key Research and Development Program of China [2017YFC0404403]; National Natural Science Foundation of ChinaNational Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC) [91747208, 51861125102]; State Key Laboratory of Hydroscience [2019-KY-01]","This work was supported by the National Key Research and Development Program of China [grant number 2017YFC0404403]; the National Natural Science Foundation of China [grant numbers 91747208, 51861125102]; and the State Key Laboratory of Hydroscience and Engineering-Tsinghua [grant number 2019-KY-01].",,43,0,0,7,12,ELSEVIER,AMSTERDAM,"RADARWEG 29, 1043 NX AMSTERDAM, NETHERLANDS",0022-1694,1879-2707,,J HYDROL,J.

We incorporate streamflow forecasts into reservoir operation by applying radial basis functions (RBFs) and evaluate the forecast value conditioned on different types of forecast lead time and reservoir characteristics. From a case study of the Danjiangkou Reservoir in the Hanjiang River basin, China, forecast value is assessed by comparing Pareto fronts of forecast-informed and no-forecast reservoir operation rules from multiobjective optimization algorithms maximizing power generation and water supply. Subsequently, we vary the installed hydropower plant capacity and capacity-inflow ratio (ratio of active reservoir storage capacity and annual reservoir inflow volume) of the Danjiangkou Reservoir to investigate corresponding forecast values in terms of magnitude and distribution. The results demonstrate that the inclusion of streamflow forecasts predominantly leads to an increase in power generation in wet years, yet the monthly distribution of generation varies with water supply. Additionally, forecast value increases with forecast lead time, resulting in approximately 10, 15, and 18 million yuan annually for forecast lead times of 10, 20, and 30 days, respectively. Finally, forecast value is demonstrated to generally increase as installed capacity increases and decrease as capacity-inflow ratio increases, however, the distribution of forecast value within a year is more sensitive to the capacity-inflow ratio.","[Yang, Guang; Block, Paul] Univ Wisconsin, Dept Civil & Environm Engn, Madison, WI 53706 USA; [Guo, Shenglian; Liu, Pan] Wuhan Univ, Sch Water Resources & Hydropower Engn, Wuhan 430072, Hubei, Peoples R China; [Guo, Shenglian; Liu, Pan] Wuhan Univ, State Key Lab Water Resources & Hydropower Engn S, Wuhan 430072, Hubei, Peoples R China",,"Guo, SL (corresponding author), Wuhan Univ, Sch Water Resources & Hydropower Engn, Wuhan 430072, Hubei, Peoples R China.; Guo, SL (corresponding author), Wuhan Univ, State Key Lab Water Resources & Hydropower Engn S, Wuhan 430072, Hubei, Peoples R China.",gyang82@gatech.edu; slguo@whu.edu.cn,,"Liu, Pan/0000-0002-3777-6561; Yang, Guang/0000-0001-7330-3502","National Natural Science Foundation of ChinaNational Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC) [51879192, 51539009]",This study was financially supported by the National Natural Science Foundation of China (Grant Nos. 51879192 and 51539009).,,60,0,0,7,9,ASCE-AMER SOC CIVIL ENGINEERS,RESTON,"1801 ALEXANDER BELL DR, RESTON, VA 20191-4400 USA",0733-9496,1943-5452,,J WATER RES PLAN MAN,J.

These preventive measures do not avoid the need for contingent plans, such as the Civil Flooding Protection Plans. Many of the Peninsula's watercourses and rivers are regulated by reservoirs built to ensure water supply and to smooth floods by releasing water in extreme hydrological climates. Hydrological modeling tools (rain/run-off) and Decision Support Systems DSS have been developed for the optimal operation of these dams in flood situations. The objective of the article is to study and prove the effectiveness of the integrated data provision in real time, while the event occurs-a circumstance that was not possible from the limited available meteorological stations available from Official Weather Services. The development of the Automatic Hydrological Information System (SAIH) in the Spanish River Basin Authorities (Confederaciones Hidrograficas), which includes a dense network of thermo-pluviometric stations and rain-river flow gauges, has allowed for new perspectives in order to realize an effective forecast method of flows during episodes of extreme precipitation. In this article, we will describe the integration of a hydrological modeling system, developed by the Confederacion Hidrografica del Tajo (River Authority), to meet the described objectives; the results of this methodology are novel. This allows for the processing of the 15-minute data provided, including the simulation of the snow accumulation/melting processes and the forecast of inflows to the reservoir to help in the establishment of safeguards and preventive waterflow releases.

In past few decades, an important dimension has been introduced in the prediction of the hydrologic phenomenon through artificial intelligence-based modeling. In this paper, the performance of three artificial neural network (ANN) and four support vector regression (SVR) models was investigated to predict streamflows in the Upper Indus River. Results from ANN models using three different optimization techniques, namely Broyden-Fletcher-Goldfarb-Shannon, Conjugate Gradient, and Back Propagation algorithms, were compared with one another. A further comparison was made between these ANNs and four types of SVR models which were based on linear, polynomial, radial basis function, and sigmoid kernels. Past 30years' monthly data for precipitation, temperature, and streamflow obtained from Pakistan Surface Water Hydrology Department Lahore were used for this purpose. Three types of input combinations with respect to the main input variables (temperature, precipitation, and stream flow) and several types of input combinations with respect to time lag were tested. The best input for ANN and SVR models was identified using correlation coefficient analysis and genetic algorithm. The performance of the ANN and SVR models was evaluated by mean bias error, Nash-Sutcliffe efficiency, root mean square error, and correlation coefficient. The efficiency of the Broyden-Fletcher-Goldfarb-Shannon-ANN model was found to be much better than that of other models, while the SVR model based on radial basis function kernel predicted stream flows with comparatively higher accuracy than the other kernels. Finally, long-term predictions of streamflow have been made by the best ANN model. It was found that stream flow of Upper Indus River has a decreasing trend.","[Ateeq-ur-Rauf; Ghumman, Abdul Razzaq; Hashmi, Hashim Nisar] Univ Engn & Technol, Fac Civil & Environm Engn, Taxila, Pakistan; [Ateeq-ur-Rauf] Univ Engn & Technol, Dept Civil Engn, Bannu Campus, Peshawar, Pakistan; [Ahmad, Sajjad] Univ Nevada, Dept Civil & Environm Engn, Las Vegas, NV USA; [Ghumman, Abdul Razzaq] Qassim Univ, Civil Engn Dept, Coll Engn, Buraydah, Saudi Arabia",,"Ghumman, AR (corresponding author), Univ Engn & Technol, Fac Civil & Environm Engn, Taxila, Pakistan.",engrateeq@uetpeshawar.edu.pk; abdul.razzaq@qec.edu.sa; sajjad.ahmad@unlv.edu; drhnh@yahoo.com,"Ahmad, Sajjad/A-2867-2008","Ahmad, Sajjad/0000-0002-9903-9321; Ghumman, Abdul Razzaq/0000-0002-4439-2013",,,,59,14,14,1,40,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0167-6369,1573-2959,,ENVIRON MONIT ASSESS,Environ.

Moreover, temperature and precipitation forecasts were estimated to detail possible effects of climate change. Using remote sensing techniques, satellite images were processed to prepare a projection to 2029. Water recharge was estimated considering the effects of slope, groundcover, and soil texture. Flash floods were estimated using lumped models, concatenating the information to HEC RAS. Water availability was estimated with a semi-distributed hydrological model (SWAT). Precipitation and temperature data were forecasted using autoregressive and exponential smoothing models.

Flood flows suffer a reduction of up to 16.54%, and the flow regime with a 90% of probability of exceedance is 1.85% (7.72 l/s) higher for 2029 than for the 2019 scenario, so an improvement in flow regulation is evident. Forecasts show an increase in average temperature of 0.11 degrees C and 15.63% in extreme rainfall by 2029. Therefore, intervention strategies in Andean basins should be supported by prospective studies that use these key variables of the system for an integrated management of water resources.","[Mera-Parra, Christian; Onate-Valdivieso, Fernando; Massa-Sanchez, Priscilla; Ochoa-Cueva, Pablo] Univ Tecn Particular Loja, Water Resources, San Cayetano Alto S-N, Loja 1101608, Ecuador; [Onate-Valdivieso, Fernando] Univ Tecn Particular Loja, Dept Geol & Mine & Civil Engn DGMIC, San Cayetano Alto S-N, Loja 1101608, Ecuador; [Massa-Sanchez, Priscilla] Univ Tecn Particular Loja UTPL, Dept Econ, Loja 1101608, Ecuador; [Ochoa-Cueva, Pablo] Univ Tecn Particular Loja, Dept Biol & Agr Sci, San Cayetano Alto 110107, Loja, Ecuador",,"Mera-Parra, C (corresponding author), Univ Tecn Particular Loja, Water Resources, San Cayetano Alto S-N, Loja 1101608, Ecuador.",cpmera@utpl.edu.ec; fronate@utpl.edu.ec; pmassa@utpl.edu.ec; paochoa@utpl.edu.ec,,"Mera-Parra, Christian/0000-0002-3850-025X; Ochoa Cueva, Pablo A./0000-0003-2230-1026",Universidad Tecnica Particular de Loja-Ecuador,"This research did not receive any specific grant from funding agencies in the public, commercial, or not-for-profit sectors.

Initially, the Kalman filter parameters are defined then recalculated for defined periods; that is, the model parameter values are constantly updated. Flows were forecasted six steps ahead (L=1, 2, 3, 4, 5 and 6 hours). The basin studied is part of the Huynamota River, delimited by the Chapalangana hydrometric station, upstream from the Aguamilpa reservoir, Nayarit, Mexico. The Huaynamota River is a tributary of the Santiago River. Hourly data series were used for precipitation and flow from August to September 2017. The DKF-ARX forecasting model showed Nash-Sutcliffe efficiency indexes between 0.99 and 0.85, with L=1 and L=6, respectively.

USACE and the Orange County Water District (OCWD) have collaborated for over 30 years to temporarily store Santa Ana River (SAR) stormflow at Prado Dam for groundwater recharge in the Orange County Groundwater Basin (Basin). USACE, OCWD, and other stakeholders are assessing Forecast Informed Reservoir Operations (FIRO) at Prado Dam as a new operational approach to capture additional supplies of SAR water for groundwater recharge without affecting Prado Dam's primary flood risk management purpose. Many dams, including Prado Dam, do not directly incorporate precipitation and streamflow forecasting in their operations. FIRO is an innovative research and operations partnership that uses weather forecasting, streamflow modeling, and watershed monitoring to help water managers selectively retain or release water from reservoirs in a manner that reflects current and forecasted conditions. A recently completed study, called a Preliminary Viability Assessment of FIRO at Prado Dam, determined that increased stormwater capture, beyond the current program, is viable subject to completion of additional studies. The ultimate increase in stormwater capture is anticipated to largely be a function of community and environmental tolerance for more frequent inundation rather than operational constraints of the dam. FIRO is a promising approach to operating Prado Dam that can increase SAR stormwater capture for recharge to the Basin, reducing the need for imported water and contributing to sustainable groundwater management.","[Woodside, Greg D.; Hutchinson, Adam S.] Orange Cty Water Dist, POB 8300, Fountain Valley, CA 92728 USA; [Ralph, F.

The challenge in meeting the standards of an expert system is primarily due to the influence and behavior of hydrological processes that is driven by natural fluctuations over the physical scale, and the resulting variance in the underlying model input datasets. River flow forecasting is an imperative task for water resources operation and management, water demand assessments, irrigation and agriculture, early flood warning and hydropower generations. This paper aims to investigate the viability of the enhanced version of extreme learning machine (EELM) model in river flow forecasting applied in a tropical environment. Herein, we apply the complete orthogonal decomposition (COD) learning tool to tune the output-hidden layer of the ELM model's internal neuronal system, instead of the conventional multi-resolution tool (e.g., singular value decomposition). To demonstrate the application of EELM model, the Kelantan River, located in the Malaysian peninsular, selected as a case study. For a comparison of the EELM model, and further model evaluation, two distinct data-intelligent models are developed (i.e., the classical ELM and the support vector regression, SVR model). An exhaustive list of diagnostic indicators are used to evaluate the EELM model in respect to the benchmark algorithms, namely, SVR and ELM. The model performance indicators exhibit superior results for the EELM model relative to ELM and SVR models. In addition, the EELM model is presented as a more accurate, alternative predictive tool for modelling the tropical river flow patterns and its underlying characteristic perturbations in the physical space. Several statistical metrics defined as the coefficient of determination (r), Nash-Sutcliffe efficiency (E-ns), Willmott's Index (WI), root-mean-square error (RMSE) and mean absolute error (MAE) are computed to assess the model's effectiveness. In quantitative terms, superiority of EELM over ELM and SVR models was exhibited by E-ns = 0.7995, 0.7434 and 0.665, r = 0.894, 0.869 and 0.818 and WI = 0.9380, 0.9180 and 0.8921, respectively. Whereas, EELM model attained lower (RMSE and MAE) values by approximately (11.61-22.53%) and (8.26-8.72%) relative to ELM and SVR models, respectively. The obtained results reveal that the EELM model is a robust expert model and can be embraced practically in real-life water resources management and river sustainability decisions. As a complementary component of this paper, we also review state-of-art research works where scholars have embraced extensive implementation of the ELM model in water resource engineering problems. A comprehensive evaluation is carried out to recognize the current limitations, and also to propose potential opportunities of applying improved variants of the ELM model presented as a future research direction.","[Yaseen, Zaher Mundher] Ton Duc Thang Univ, Fac Civil Engn, Sustainable Dev Civil Engn Res Grp, Ho Chi Minh City, Vietnam; [Sulaiman, Sadeq Oleiwi] Univ Anbar, Coll Engn, Dams & Water Resources Dept, Ramadi, Iraq; [Deo, Ravinesh C.] Univ Southern Queensland, Inst Life Sci & Environm, Ctr Sustainable Agr Syst, Springfield, Qld 4300, Australia; [Deo, Ravinesh C.] Sch Agr Computat & Environm Sci, Ctr Appl Climate Sci, Springfield, Qld 4300, Australia; [Chau, Kwok-Wing] Hong Kong Polytech Univ, Dept Civil & Environm Engn, Hung Hom, Kowloon, Hong Kong, Peoples R China",,"Yaseen, ZM (corresponding author), Ton Duc Thang Univ, Fac Civil Engn, Sustainable Dev Civil Engn Res Grp, Ho Chi Minh City, Vietnam.",yaseen@tdtu.edu.vn,"Chau, Kwok-wing/E-5235-2011; Yaseen, Zaher Mundher/G-7029-2018; Deo, Ravinesh/F-6157-2012; Sulaiman, Sadeq Oleiwi/I-6570-2016","Chau, Kwok-wing/0000-0001-6457-161X; Yaseen, Zaher Mundher/0000-0003-3647-7137; Deo, Ravinesh/0000-0002-2290-6749; Sulaiman, Sadeq Oleiwi/0000-0001-6240-5685",,,,171,286,291,48,452,ELSEVIER,AMSTERDAM,"RADARWEG 29, 1043 NX AMSTERDAM, NETHERLANDS",0022-1694,1879-2707,,J HYDROL,J.

Therefore, hydrology forecasting, especially the flooding, has become a hot research spot in all countries of the world. Based on the basic principle of flooding formation, this paper proposes a data-driven hydrology forecasting model, i.e., the CRML (Convolution Regression based on Machine Learning). This model could reflect the impact of hourly rainfall on the future flow changes and the flow changes are predicted by superimposing these impacts. First, our work is implemented on historical data onto the Xixian River Basin in Henan Province, China. Through the data filtering, the training set of our model is constructed by using the flood process selection algorithm proposed in this paper. Next, the gradient descent algorithm is used to update the weights of the model, and the optimal weights are verified by ten flooding events generated in the past ten years. Finally, the numerical results show that the qualified rates of our model in predicting flood peak flow and its arrival time is approximately 90% and 100%, respectively. Compared with the latest popular artificial intelligence schemes, our model structure is clear and concise. And combined with the physical meaning of the traditional model and machine learning technology, our model can accurately complete the task of long and short lead time hydrology forecasting.","[Chen, Chen; Hui, Qiang; Pei, Qingqi; Lv, Ning] Xidian Univ, State Key Lab Integrated Serv Networks, Xian 710071, Shaanxi, Peoples R China; [Chen, Chen] Tongji Univ, Key Lab Embedded Syst & Serv Comp, Minist Educ, Shanghai 201804, Peoples R China; [Zhou, Yang; Li, Ji] Goldenwater Informat Technol Dev Co Ltd, Beijing 101400, Peoples R China; [Wang, Bin] Xian Univ Sci & Technol, Sch Commun Engn, Xian 710054, Shaanxi, Peoples R China",,"Chen, C (corresponding author), Xidian Univ, State Key Lab Integrated Serv Networks, Xian 710071, Shaanxi, Peoples R China.; Chen, C (corresponding author), Tongji Univ, Key Lab Embedded Syst & Serv Comp, Minist Educ, Shanghai 201804, Peoples R China.",cc2000@mail.xidian.edu.cn,"Hui, Kabuto/AAF-3694-2020","Hui, Qiang/0000-0002-3674-092X","National Key Research and Development Program of China [2017YFE0121400]; National Natural Science Foundation of ChinaNational Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC) [61571338, U1709218, 61672131, U1636209]; Key Research and Development Plan of Shaanxi Province [2017ZDCXL-GY-05-01, 2019ZDLGY13-04, 2019ZDLGY13-07]; Key Laboratory of Embedded System and Service Computing, Tongji University [ESSCKF2019-05]; Xian Key Laboratory of Mobile Edge Computing and Security [201805052-ZD3CG36]","This work was supported in part by the National Key Research and Development Program of China under Grant 2017YFE0121400, in part by the National Natural Science Foundation of China under Grant 61571338, Grant U1709218, Grant 61672131, and Grant U1636209, in part by the Key Research and Development Plan of Shaanxi Province under Grant 2017ZDCXL-GY-05-01, Grant 2019ZDLGY13-04, and Grant 2019ZDLGY13-07, in part by the Key Laboratory of Embedded System and Service Computing, Tongji University, under Grant ESSCKF2019-05, and in part by the Xian Key Laboratory of Mobile Edge Computing and Security under Grant 201805052-ZD3CG36.",,48,2,3,7,12,IEEE-INST ELECTRICAL ELECTRONICS ENGINEERS INC,PISCATAWAY,"445 HOES LANE, PISCATAWAY, NJ 08855-4141 USA",2169-3536,,,IEEE ACCESS,IEEE Access,,2019,7,,,,,,133839,133849,,10.1109/ACCESS.2019.2941234,,,11,"Computer Science, Information Systems; Engineering, Electrical & Electronic; Telecommunications",Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),Computer Science; Engineering; Telecommunications,JQ0NR,WOS:000498652400011,,gold,,,2022-02-17

We first incorporated global lake fraction and depth data into the coupled CFS-FLake through a subgridding system. An interface between the CFS and FLake was then developed to link the two models for energy and water flux exchanges. The lake scheme was triggered only if the lake fraction was more than 10% in one CFS grid cell. We conducted ensemble retrospective forecasts with CFS-FLake for the period of 1997 through 2016 with 9 monthly leads. These forecasts were assessed to obtain a better understanding of the role of the Great Lakes in the climate system for winter, when significant lake-effect precipitation often occurs. Our results indicate that forecasts of lake surface temperature (LST), lake ice coverage (LIC), and precipitation with CFS-FLake were consistently better than those with CFS. The major improvements resulted from changes in land use type for the Great Lakes, from ocean and land in CFS to lakes in CFS-FLake. With the change from ocean to lake, LST mostly decreased with increasing LIC, resulting in lower surface heat and water fluxes to the atmosphere during the winter. However, with the change from land to lake, LST increased, leading to higher heat and water fluxes. In the meantime, precipitation predicted by CFS-FLake was reduced quite significantly over the Great Lakes compared to that by CFS. This reduction was caused by suppressed rising motion due to increased stability in the lower atmosphere as a result of lowered surface heat and water fluxes. The results from this study indicate that local and mesoscale surface and atmospheric processes significantly affect regional climate forecasts, and the coupled CFS-FLake model will have a broader impact on climate and hydrology research and forecasts.","[Lv, Zhemin; Jin, Jiming] Northwest A&F Univ, Key Lab Agr Soil & Water Engn Arid & Semiarid Are, Minist Educ, Yangling 712100, Shaanxi, Peoples R China; [Lv, Zhemin; Jin, Jiming] Northwest A&F Univ, Coll Water Resources & Architectural Engn, Yangling 712100, Shaanxi, Peoples R China; [Zhang, Shaobo] Chengdu Univ Informat Technol, Sch Atmospher Sci, Chengdu 610225, Sichuan, Peoples R China; [Jin, Jiming] Utah State Univ, Dept Watershed Sci, Logan, UT 84322 USA; [Wu, Yihua] NOAA, IM Syst Grp, EMC, NCEP, College Pk, MD 20740 USA; [Ek, Michael B.] Natl Ctr Atmospher Res, Joint Numer Testbed, Res Applicat Lab, POB 3000, Boulder, CO 80307 USA",,"Jin, JM (corresponding author), Northwest A&F Univ, Key Lab Agr Soil & Water Engn Arid & Semiarid Are, Minist Educ, Yangling 712100, Shaanxi, Peoples R China.; Jin, JM (corresponding author), Northwest A&F Univ, Coll Water Resources & Architectural Engn, Yangling 712100, Shaanxi, Peoples R China.; Jin, JM (corresponding author), Utah State Univ, Dept Watershed Sci, Logan, UT 84322 USA.",Jiming.Jin@usu.edu,,,"NOAA MAPPCTB [NA14OAR4310191]; National Natural Science Foundation of ChinaNational Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC) [91437219, 91637209, 41175005]; Utah Agricultural Experiment Station; National Science FoundationNational Science Foundation (NSF) [1603088]","This research was supported by NOAA MAPPCTB (No. NA14OAR4310191), the National Natural Science Foundation of China (No. 91437219, No. 91637209, No. 41175005), and the Utah Agricultural Experiment Station and the National Science Foundation (No. 1603088).

In this study, a hybrid machine-learning approach based on hydrological and data-driven modeling is developed for daily streamflow forecasting. The proposed hybrid hydrological data-driven model (HHDD) approach succeeds in improving daily prediction compared to that predicted by the standard conceptual hydrological model (HYMOD).

Within NSRPS, the Canadian Land Data Assimilation System (CaLDAS) produces snow analyses that are used to initialise the land surface model, which in turn is used to force the river routing component. Originally, CaLDAS was designed to improve atmospheric forecasts with less focus on hydrological processes. When snow data assimilation occurs, the related increments remove/add water from/to the system, which can sometimes be problematic for streamflow forecasting, in particular during the snowmelt period. In this study, a new snow analysis method introduces multiple innovations that respond to the need for higher quality snow analyses for hydrological purposes, including the use of IMS snow cover extent data instead of in situ snow depth observations. The results show that the new snow assimilation methodology brings an overall improvement to snow analyses and substantially enhances water conservation, which is reflected in the generally improved streamflow simulations. This work represents a first step towards a new snow data assimilation process in CaLDAS, with the final objective of producing a reliable snow analysis to initialise and improve NWP as well as environmental predictions, including flood and drought forecasts.","[Garnaud, Camille; Vionnet, Vincent; Gaborit, Etienne; Fortin, Vincent; Bilodeau, Bernard; Carrera, Marco] Environm & Climate Change Canada, Meteorol Res Div, Dorval, PQ H9P 1J3, Canada; [Durnford, Dorothy] Environm & Climate Change Canada, Meteorol Serv Canada, Dorval, PQ H9P 1J3, Canada",,"Garnaud, C (corresponding author), Environm & Climate Change Canada, Meteorol Res Div, Dorval, PQ H9P 1J3, Canada.",camille.garnaud@ec.gc.ca; vincent.vionnet@canada.ca; etienne.gaborit@canada.ca; vincent.fortin@canada.ca; bernard.bilodeau2@canada.ca; marco.carrera@canada.ca; dorothy.durnford@canada.ca,,,,,,50,0,0,0,0,MDPI,BASEL,"ST ALBAN-ANLAGE 66, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND",,2072-4292,,REMOTE SENS-BASEL,Remote Sens.,DEC,2021,13,24,,,,,,,5022,10.3390/rs13245022,,,24,"Environmental Sciences; Geosciences, Multidisciplinary; Remote Sensing; Imaging Science & Photographic Technology",Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),Environmental Sciences & Ecology; Geology; Remote Sensing; Imaging Science & Photographic Technology,XZ0SM,WOS:000737372500001,,Green Published,,,2022-02-17

These models incorporate the historical streamflow series as inputs of the model to forecast the future streamflow with data from January 1956 to December 2016 at the Shangjingyou station and from January 1958 to December 2016 at the Fenhe reservoir station. The IGWO-GRU model exhibited a strong ability for mapping in streamflow series when the parameters were carefully tuned. The monthly predictive structure can effectively extract the instinctive hydrological information that is more easily learned by the predictive model than the traditional sequential predictive structure. The monthly IGWO-GRU model was found to be a better forecasting tool, with an average qualification rate of 91.66% in two stations. It also showed good performance in absolute error and peak flow forecasting.","[Zhao, Xuehua; Lv, Hanfang; Wei, Yizhao; Zhu, Xueping] Taiyuan Univ Technol, Coll Water Resources & Engn, Taiyuan 030024, Peoples R China; [Lv, Shujin] Baoding Univ, Dept Data Sci & Software Engn, Baoding 071000, Peoples R China",,"Zhao, XH (corresponding author), Taiyuan Univ Technol, Coll Water Resources & Engn, Taiyuan 030024, Peoples R China.",zhaoxh688@126.com; hbbdlhf@163.com; weiyizhao0609@163.com; lshjin@sina.com; xpzhu01@163.com,,,National Key Research and Development Program of China [2019YFC0408601]; Key Research and Development Program of Shanxi Province [201903D321052]; Natural Science Foundation of Shanxi ProvinceNatural Science Foundation of Shanxi Province [201901D111060],"This paper is supported by the National Key Research and Development Program of China (Grant No. 2019YFC0408601), the Key Research and Development Program of Shanxi Province (Grant No. 201903D321052), and the Natural Science Foundation of Shanxi Province (Grant No. 201901D111060).",,41,1,1,5,16,MDPI,BASEL,"ST ALBAN-ANLAGE 66, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND",,2073-4441,,WATER-SUI,Water,JAN,2021,13,1,,,,,,,91,10.3390/w13010091,,,17,Environmental Sciences; Water Resources,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),Environmental Sciences & Ecology; Water Resources,PQ2QT,WOS:000606394800001,,gold,,,2022-02-17

Over the last few decades, this basin has been experiencing water-related problems such as water scarcity and competing use of water. This study assesses the impact of future climate change on the availability of water resources in the Gediz Basin during the 21st century by investigating the inflows into the major reservoir in the basin, Demirkopru Reservoir, which is the major source of irrigation water to the basin. The analysis in this study involves setting up a coupled hydro-climate model over the Gediz Basin by coupling the Weather Research and Forecasting (WRF) model to the physically-based Watershed Environmental Hydrology (WEHY) model. First, the WRF model is used to reconstruct the historical climatic variables over the basin by dynamically downscaling the ERA-Interim reanalysis dataset The calibrated and validated WRF model is then used to dynamically downscale eight different future climate projections over the Gediz Basin to a much finer resolution (6 km), which is more appropriate for the hydrologic modeling of the basin. These climate projections are from four Coupled Model Intercomparison Project Phase 5 (CMIP5) Global Climate Models (GCMs), namely, CCSM4, GFDL-ESM2M, HadGEM2-ES, and MIROC5, under two IPCC (The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change) representative concentration pathway scenarios (RCP4.5 and RCP8.5). The outputs from the WRF model are then input into the WEHY model, which is calibrated and validated over the basin, to simulate the hydrological processes within the basin and to obtain the projected future inflows into the Demirkopru Reservoir. Results of the future analysis over the 21st century (2017-2100) are then compared to the historical values (1985-2012) to investigate the impacts of future climate change on the hydroclimatology of the Gediz Basin.

Researchers typically ignore the large degree of uncertainty translated from climate projections to the estimated climate change magnitudes while applying pre-processing approaches on climate change projections. General Circulation Models (GCM) exhibit substantial uncertainty in projecting future changes in the seasonal temperature, which is evaluated by estimating the shift in either the mean or variance. Bias between the observed changes (1950-1999) and GCM simulated changes vary across models, climate regions, seasons, and under emission scenarios. The simplest approach to reduce model structural uncertainty, equal weighting of GCMs, does not consider superiority of one or multiple GCMs compared to the rest. The current study adopts a performance-based model combination approach that has shown efficiency in streamflow and weather forecasting, and GCM precipitation simulation. The optimal model combination approach has been modified to combine multi-model climate change information, while yielding the spatial correlation in climate change information within a geographic region. The optimal model combination approach, along with a simple bias-correction, is applied on 10 GCMs over nine climate regions across the coterminous United States (CONUS). We found that the optimal combination exhibits lower RMSE values as compared to the equal combination. Correlations between the model combined projections under optimal combination and the observed changes are strong and positive (>0.5). Future (2000-49) model combined projections exhibit an increase in the mean seasonal temperature by 2 degrees C for winter and by 1 degrees C for summer over almost all climate regions.","[Das Bhowmik, Rajarshi] Indian Inst Sci, Dept Civil Engn, Bangalore, Karnataka, India; [Sankarasubramanian, Arumugam] North Carolina State Univ, Dept Civil Construct & Environm Engn, Raleigh, NC USA",,"Das Bhowmik, R (corresponding author), Indian Inst Sci, Dept Civil Engn, CV Raman Rd, Bengaluru 560012, Karnataka, India.",rajarshidb@iisc.ac.in,"; Arumugam, Sankarasubramanian/A-1929-2019","Das Bhowmik, Rajarshi/0000-0002-2849-3180; Arumugam, Sankarasubramanian/0000-0002-7668-1311",National Science FoundationNational Science Foundation (NSF) [CBET-1204368],"National Science Foundation, Grant/Award Number: CBET-1204368",,73,1,1,0,4,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0899-8418,1097-0088,,INT J CLIMATOL,Int.

Taiwan has the climatic characteristics of concentrated rainy seasons, instantaneous heavy rains due to typhoons and rainy seasons. In addition, steep rivers in mountainous areas flow fast and furiously. Under such circumstances, reservoirs have to face sudden heavy rainfall and surges in water levels within a short period of time, which often causes the water level to continue to rise to the full level even though hydroelectric units are operating at full capacity, and as reservoirs can only drain the flood water, this results in the waste of hydropower resources. In recent years, the impact of climate change has caused extreme weather events to occur more frequently, increasing the need for flood control, and the reservoir operation has faced severe challenges in order to fulfil its multipurpose requirements. Therefore, in order to avoid the waste of hydropower resources and improve the effectiveness of the reservoir operation, this paper proposes a real-time 48-h ahead water level forecasting system, based on fuzzy neural networks with multi-stage architecture. The proposed multi-stage architecture provides reservoir inflow estimation, 48-h ahead reservoir inflow forecasting, and 48-h ahead water level forecasting. The proposed method has been implemented at the Techi hydropower plant in Taiwan. Experimental results show that the proposed method can effectively increase energy efficiency and allow the reservoir water resources to be fully utilized. In addition, the proposed method can improve the effectiveness of the hydropower plant, especially when rain is heavy.","[Tsao, Hao-Han; Leu, Yih-Guang] Natl Taiwan Normal Univ, Dept Elect Engn, Taipei 106, Taiwan; [Chou, Li-Fen; Tsao, Chao-Yang] Taiwan Power Co, Taipei 100, Taiwan",,"Leu, YG (corresponding author), Natl Taiwan Normal Univ, Dept Elect Engn, Taipei 106, Taiwan.",a822873@gmail.com; leuyk@ntnu.edu.tw; lillian129360@gmail.com; jefftsao0103@gmail.com,,"Tsao, Hao-Han/0000-0001-5644-4979",,,,48,0,0,3,3,MDPI,BASEL,"ST ALBAN-ANLAGE 66, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND",,1996-1073,,ENERGIES,Energies,JUN,2021,14,12,,,,,,,3461,10.3390/en14123461,,,21,Energy & Fuels,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),Energy & Fuels,SZ0EK,WOS:000666249800001,,gold,,,2022-02-17

The ability to forecast streamflow is crucial, as it can help mitigate flood risks. Long-term stream flow data records are needed for hydropower plant construction, flood prediction, watershed management, and long-term water supply use. An accurate assessment of streamflow is considered as very challenging and critical tasks. A new predicting model is developed in this research, combining the technique of sunflower optimization (SFA) as an evolutionary algorithm with the multi-layer perceptron (MLP) algorithm to predict streamflow in Malaysia's Jam Seyed Omar (JSO) and Muda Di Jeniang (MDJ) stations. Principal component analysis (PCA) was performed on Q (t) (t: the number of the current day) before model creation to pick essential inputs for a maximum of 6 lags. With the classical MLP and two other hybrid MLP models (MLP-particle swarm optimization (MLP-PSO) and MLP-genetic algorithm (MLP-GA)), the results of the MLP-sunflower algorithm (SFA) were benchmarked. As compared to other models, the MLP-SFA could be able to reduce the Root Mean Square Error (RMSE) by a value of between 12 and 21% at the JSO station and between 8 and 24% at the MDJ station. In conclusion, this research found that combining MLP with optimization algorithms improved the precision of the stand-alone MLP model, with SFA integration being the most efficient.","[Sammen, Saad Sh.] Univ Diyala, Dept Civil Engn, Coll Engn, Diyala Governorate, Iraq; [Ehteram, Mohammad] Semnan Univ, Dept Water Engn & Hydraul Struct, Fac Civil Engn, Semnan, Iran; [Abba, S.

In this paper, taking Ankang Reservoir as an example, a forecast-based operation (FBO) mode for flood control is developed with cumulative net rainfall in the real-time rolling prediction as the primary indicator and the water level in the reservoir as the auxiliary indicator. Based on the accuracy of flood forecasting data, FBO rules for reservoir flood control are formulated by using the stepwise regulation method considering the actual situation of Ankang Reservoir. For verification, a flood routing simulation is conducted for designed and typical flood processes with different recurrence intervals using the formulated rules. The results show that the maximum flood level is lower than for conventional regulation and that the duration of the maximum discharge under the forecast operation mode is slightly shorter than the conventional discharge, which indicates that the flood risk is reduced to some extent by applying the formulated FBO rules and, correspondingly, demonstrates the merits and applicability of implementing FBO mode for Ankang reservoir.","[Wang, Xiao; Liu, Zhao; Jia, Zhifeng] Changan Univ, Sch Environm Sci & Engn, 126 Yanta Rd, Xian 710054, Shaanxi, Peoples R China; [Liu, Zhao; Jia, Zhifeng] Changan Univ, Minist Educ, Key Lab Subsurface Hydrol & Ecol Effects Arid Reg, 126 Yanta Rd, Xian 710054, Shaanxi, Peoples R China; [Zhou, Weibo] Changan Univ, Sch Earth Sci & Resources, 126 Yanta Rd, Xian 710054, Shaanxi, Peoples R China; [You, Qiying] Changan Univ, Sch Sci, Xian 710064, Shaanxi, Peoples R China",,"Liu, Z (corresponding author), Changan Univ, Sch Environm Sci & Engn, 126 Yanta Rd, Xian 710054, Shaanxi, Peoples R China.; Liu, Z (corresponding author), Changan Univ, Minist Educ, Key Lab Subsurface Hydrol & Ecol Effects Arid Reg, 126 Yanta Rd, Xian 710054, Shaanxi, Peoples R China.",lz975315@yahoo.com,,,"Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities, CHD [300102299206, 300102269201]; Shaanxi Provincial Department of Water Resources Technology Planning Project [2018SLKJ-10]; Xi'an Construction Science and Technology Planning Project [SJW2017-11]","U The authors acknowledge the financial supported by the Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities, CHD (Program No. 300102299206, 300102269201), the Shaanxi Provincial Department of Water Resources Technology Planning Project (2018SLKJ-10) and the Xi'an Construction Science and Technology Planning Project (SJW2017-11).",,30,3,3,7,33,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0920-4741,1573-1650,,WATER RESOUR MANAG,Water Resour.

The aim of this study was to obtain a predictive model able to perform an early detection of the eutrophication in water bodies such as lakes. This study presents a novel hybrid algorithm, based on support vector machines (SVM) approach in combination with the particle swarm optimization (PSO) technique, for predicting the eutrophication from biological and physical-chemical input parameters determined experimentally through sampling and subsequent analysis in a certificate laboratory. This optimization technique involves hyperparameter setting in the SVM training procedure, which significantly influences the regression accuracy. The results of the present study are twofold. In the first place, the significance of each biological and physical-chemical variables on the eutrophication is presented through the model. Secondly, a model for forecasting eutrophication is obtained with success. Indeed, regression with optimal hyperparameters was performed and coefficients of determination equal to 0.90 for the Total phosphorus estimation and 0.92 for the Chlorophyll concentration were obtained when this hybrid PSO-SVM-based model was applied to the experimental dataset, respectively.

A model incorporating heat fluxes, winds, and stationary wavelet decomposition generated correlation coefficients > 0.88 and relative errors < 4% throughout the water column for up to 240-d ahead forecasts. Internal wave motions at the thermocline resulted in larger relative errors of forecasts in the metalimnion compared to other depths. Greater atmospheric influences on water temperature and dissolved oxygen resulted in larger forecast errors compared to conductivity.

The model applies a Monte Carlo approach combined with nonlinear threshold autoregressive models using the seasonal streamflow forecasts from the Bureau of Meteorology as input and it was validated over different historical conditions. Treatment operators can use the model for quantifying depletion rates and spill likelihood for the forthcoming six weeks, based on the seasonal climatic conditions and different intake scenarios.

This study focuses on the prediction of water quality parameters such as the dissolved oxygen (DO) in the watershed system. The traditional recurrent neural networks (RNNs) suffer from gradient disappearance or explosion and inability to solve the problem of long-time dependence, and their practical applications are limited. To overcome this drawback, an improved long short-term memory (LSTM) model was proposed to improve the model's performance. In addition, to overcome nonstationarity, randomness, and nonlinearity of the water quality parameters data, a hybrid model that recruits synchrosqueezed wavelet transform (SWT) to denoise the original data was adopted. A novel metaheuristic optimization algorithm, the improved sparrow search algorithm (ISSA) combining Cauchy mutation and opposition-based learning (OBL) was also implemented to compute the optimal parameter values for the LSTM model. The proposed hybrid model was evaluated using an original weekly water quality parameters series, from 1/2010-12/2016, measured at the Yongding River and Gangnan gauging stations in the Haihe River Basin, China. The standalone LSTM, ISSA-LSTM, SWT-LSTM, support vector regression (SVR), and back propagation neural network (BPNN) were adopted as comparative forecast models using the same dataset. The results demonstrate that the addressed model, combining the strong noise-resistant robustness of the SWT and the nonlinear mapping of the LSTM, has the best prediction performance among the peer models at two gauging stations. The proposed hybrid model can be used as an alternative framework for water quality prediction, which can provide decision-making basis for comprehensive water quality management and pollutant control in the basin.","[Song, Chenguang; Yao, Leihua; Hua, Chengya; Ni, Qihang] China Univ Geosci Beijing, Sch Engn & Technol, Beijing 100083, Peoples R China",,"Yao, LH (corresponding author), China Univ Geosci Beijing, Sch Engn & Technol, Beijing 100083, Peoples R China.",yaolh@cugb.edu.cn,"Song, Chenguang/ABE-6672-2021","Song, Chenguang/0000-0001-9650-880X",,,,52,3,3,34,34,ELSEVIER,AMSTERDAM,"RADARWEG 29, 1043 NX AMSTERDAM, NETHERLANDS",0022-1694,1879-2707,,J HYDROL,J.

Understanding what drives excessive algal growth can inform mitigation measures and aid in advance planning to minimize impacts. We demonstrate how simulated data from weather, hydrological, and agroecosystem numerical prediction models can be combined with machine learning (ML) to assess and predict chlorophyll a (chl a) concentrations, a proxy for lake eutrophication and algal biomass. The study area is Lake Erie for a 16-year period, 2002-2017. A total of 20 environmental variables from linked and coupled physical models are used as input features to train the ML model with chl a observations from 16 measuring stations. Included are meteorological variables from the Weather Research and Forecasting (WRF) model, hydrological variables from the Variable Infiltration Capacity (VIC) model, and agricultural management practice variables from the Environmental Policy Integrated Climate (EPIC) agroecosystem model. The consolidation of these variables is conducive to a successful prediction of chl a. Aside from the synergistic effects that weather, hydrology, and fertilizers have on eutrophication and excessive algal growth, we found that the application of different forms of both P and N fertilizers are highly ranked for the prediction of chl a concentration. The developed ML model successfully predicts chl a with a coefficient of determination of 0.81, bias of -0.12 lg/l and RMSE of 4.97 lg/l. The developed ML-based modeling approach can be used for impact assessment of agriculture practices in a changing climate that affect chl a concentrations in Lake Erie.

Since their creation, these centers have seen their activity evolve, integrating new challenges over the years, taking advantage of methodological advances made, implementing new organizations while developing new distribution supports and improving communication. The first step of the operational forecast chain is the analysis of observation data, either climatologic or hydrologic. Then, after a study of the meteorological context, allowing the forecasters to evaluate the uncertainties, they build a precipitation and air temperature scenario to feed the hydrological model. Through this rainfall-runoff model, a streamflow forecast is obtained, that can still be expertized before diffusion to the end-user. Probabilistic daily forecasts at 14 days, statistically calibrated, are automatically elaborated. Then, these are refined by deformation of distribution's synthetic variables. Very useful for various uses, these forecasts allow, a minima, an anticipated detection of a flood event risk of occurrence. In most cases, daily streamfiow forecast is sufficient for reservoir volume management, but in case of a rapid evolution, the hourly forecast can be helpful. Thus, the generalization of hourly flow forecast is a major stake for EDF. It results in: (i) the design of an hydrological model adapted to this time step, whose free parameters are then calibrated on more than 200 catchments; and (ii) an enriched communication to represent uncertainties on flood dynamic, volumes, gradients and maximal values of forecasted streamfiow. The hourly forecasts are then widely diffused to the end-users. At the same time, in 2008, a precise communication protocol, based on probabilities, has been conceived by EDF to warn in anticipation the dam managers of a potential threshold overrun. Thus, the expressions Fort Risque (greater risk) and Risque (risk) were used, communicated and explained, and are today an integral part of the diffused information. So, the hydrometeorological forecast is in permanent evolution at EDF. The next challenges are (i) the realization of expertized probabilistic hourly forecasts and (ii) the production of a more significant number of forecasts (currently 30,000 forecasts a year) answering the end-user expectations, mainly in flood period.","[Moulin, Letitia] EDF DTG, 14 Rue Paul Mesple, F-31100 Toulouse, France; [Abonnel, Alain; Puygrenier, Damien; Valery, Audrey; Garcon, Remy] EDF DTG, 21 Ave Europe,BP 41, F-38040 Grenoble 9, France",,"Garcon, R (corresponding author), EDF DTG, 21 Ave Europe,BP 41, F-38040 Grenoble 9, France.",laetitia.moulin@edf.fr,,,,,,12,0,0,0,1,EDP SCIENCES S A,LES ULIS CEDEX A,"17, AVE DU HOGGAR, PA COURTABOEUF, BP 112, F-91944 LES ULIS CEDEX A, FRANCE",0018-6368,1958-5551,,HOUILLE BLANCHE,Houille Blanche-Rev.

The State of Michigan, USA, contains ecologically, socioeconomically valuable coldwater stream salmonid fisheries that are highly susceptible to these ecological alterations. Thus, there is a need for future management approaches that promote resilient stream ecosystems that absorb change amidst disturbances. Fisheries professionals in Michigan are responding to this need by designing a comprehensive management plan for stream brook charr (Salvelinus fontinalis), brown trout (Salmo trutta) and rainbow trout (Oncorhynchus mykiss) populations. To assist in developing such a plan, we used stream-specific regression models to forecast thermal habitat suitability in streams throughout Michigan from 2006 to 2056 under different predicted climate change scenarios. As baseflow index (i.e., relative groundwater input) increased, stream thermal sensitivity (i.e., relative susceptibility to temperature change) decreased. Thus, the magnitude of temperature warming and frequency of thermal habitat degradation were lowest in streams with the highest baseflow indices. Thermal habitats were most suitable in rainbow trout streams as this species has a wider temperature range for growth (12.0-22.5 degrees C) compared to brook charr (11.0-20.5 degrees C) and brown trout (12.0-20.0 degrees C). Our study promotes resilience-based salmonid management by providing a methodology for stream temperature and thermal habitat suitability prediction. Fisheries professionals can use this approach to protect coldwater habitats and drivers of stream cooling and ultimately conserve resilient salmonid populations amidst global change.","[Carlson, Andrew K.; Taylor, William W.; Schlee, Kelsey M.; Infante, Dana M.] Michigan State Univ, Dept Fisheries & Wildlife, Ctr Syst Integrat & Sustainabil, E Lansing, MI 48824 USA; [Zorn, Troy G.] Michigan Dept Nat Resources, Marquette Fisheries Res Stn, Marquette, MI 49855 USA",,"Carlson, AK (corresponding author), Michigan State Univ, Dept Fisheries & Wildlife, Ctr Syst Integrat & Sustainabil, E Lansing, MI 48824 USA.",carls422@msu.edu,,,,,,62,21,21,1,66,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0906-6691,1600-0633,,ECOL FRESHW FISH,Ecol.

This work focuses on improving such forecasts by considering the following two aspects: (1) state updating to force the models to match observations from the start of the forecast period, and (2) selection of a shorter calibration period that is more representative of the forecast period, compared to a longer calibration period traditionally used. The analysis is undertaken in the context of using streamflow forecasts for environmental flow water management of an open channel drainage network in southern Australia. Forecasts of monthly streamflow are obtained using a conceptual rainfall-runoff model combined with a post-processor error model for uncertainty analysis. This model set-up is applied to two catchments, one with stronger evidence of non-stationarity than the other. A range of metrics are used to assess different aspects of predictive performance, including reliability, sharpness, bias and accuracy. The results indicate that, for most scenarios and metrics, state updating improves predictive performance for both observed rainfall and forecast rainfall sources. Using the shorter calibration period also improves predictive performance, particularly for the catchment with stronger evidence of non-stationarity. The results highlight that a traditional approach of using a long calibration period can degrade predictive performance when there is evidence of non-stationarity. The techniques presented can form the basis for operational monthly streamflow forecasting systems and provide support for environmental decision-making.","[Gibbs, Matthew S.; McInerney, David; Humphrey, Greer; Thyer, Mark A.; Maier, Holger R.; Dandy, Graeme C.; Kavetski, Dmitri] Univ Adelaide, Sch Civil Environm & Min Engn, North Terrace, Adelaide, SA 5005, Australia; [Gibbs, Matthew S.] Govt South Australia, Dept Environm Water & Nat Resources, POB 1047, Adelaide, SA 5000, Australia",,"Gibbs, MS (corresponding author), Univ Adelaide, Sch Civil Environm & Min Engn, North Terrace, Adelaide, SA 5005, Australia.; Gibbs, MS (corresponding author), Govt South Australia, Dept Environm Water & Nat Resources, POB 1047, Adelaide, SA 5000, Australia.",matthew.gibbs@adelaide.edu.au,"Gibbs, Matt/AAI-5547-2021; Humphrey, Greer B/J-6905-2012; Thyer, Mark A/A-9630-2011; Maier, Holger R/B-9639-2008; McInerney, David J/I-4896-2015","Gibbs, Matt/0000-0001-6653-8688; Humphrey, Greer B/0000-0001-7782-5463; Thyer, Mark A/0000-0002-2830-516X; Maier, Holger R/0000-0002-0277-6887; McInerney, David J/0000-0003-4876-8281",Goyder Institute for Water Research [E.2.4]; Australian Research CouncilAustralian Research Council [LP140100978]; Australian Bureau of Meteorology; South East Queensland Water,"Matthew S.

This study presents a novel application of four advanced artificial intelligence models namely the Minimax Probability Machine Regression (MPMR), Relevance Vector Machine (RVM), Gaussian Process Regression (GPR) and Extreme Learning Machine (ELM) for forecasting lake level fluctuation in Lake Huron utilizing historical datasets. The MPMR is a probabilistic framework that employed Mercer Kernels to achieve nonlinear regression models. The GPR, which is a probabilistic technique used tractable Bayesian framework for generalization of multivariate distribution of input samples to vast dimensional space. The ELM is a capable algorithm-based model for the implementation of the single-layer feed-forward neural network. The RVM demonstrate depends on the specification of the Bayesian method on a linear model with proper preceding that results in demonstration of sparse. The recommended techniques were tested to evaluate the current lake water-level trend monthly from the historical datasets at four previous time steps. The Lake Huron levels from 1918 to 1993 was managed for the training phase, and the rest of data (from 1994 to 2013) was used for testing. Considering the monthly and annually previous time steps, six models were introduced and found that the best results are achieved for a model with (t-1, t-2, t-3, t-12) as input combinations. The results show that all models can forecast the lake levels precisely.

To assess these hydroclimatic risks under high-end emission scenario RCP8.5, this study used the Weather Research Forecasting (WRF) model at a convection-permitting (CP) 4 km resolution to dynamically downscale the mean projection of a 19-member CMIP5 ensemble by the end of the 21st century. The CP simulations include a retrospective simulation (CTL, 2000-2015) for verification forced by ERA-Interim and a pseudo-global warming (PGW) for climate change projection forced with climate change forcing (2071-2100 to 1976-2005) from CMIP5 ensemble added on ERA-Interim. The retrospective WRF-CTL's surface air temperature simulation was evaluated against Canadian daily analysis ANUS-PLIN, showing good agreements in the geographical distribution with cold biases east of the Canadian Rockies, especially in spring. WRF-CTL captures the main pattern of observed precipitation distribution from CaPA and ANUS-PLIN but shows a wet bias near the British Columbia coast in winter and over the immediate region on the lee side of the Canadian Rockies. The WRF-PGW simulation shows significant warming relative to CTL, especially over the polar region in the northeast during the cold season, and in daily minimum temperature. Precipitation changes in PGW over CTL vary with the seasons: in spring and late autumn precipitation increases in most areas, whereas in summer in the Saskatchewan River basin and southern Canadian Prairies, the precipitation change is negligible or decreased slightly. With almost no increase in precipitation and much more evapotranspiration in the future, the water availability during the growing season will be challenging for the Canadian Prairies. The WRF-PGW projected warming is less than that by the CMIP5 ensemble in all seasons. The CMIP5 ensemble projects a 10 %-20% decrease in summer precipitation over the Canadian Prairies and generally agrees with WRF-PGW except for regions with significant terrain. This difference may be due to the much higher resolution of WRF being able to more faithfully represent small-scale summer convection and orographic lifting due to steep terrain. WRF-PGW shows an increase in high-intensity precipitation events and shifts the distribution of precipitation events toward more extremely intensive events in all seasons. Due to this shift in precipitation intensity to the higher end in the PGW simulation, the seemingly moderate increase in the total amount of precipitation in summer east of the Canadian Rockies may underestimate the increase in flooding risk and water shortage for agriculture. The change in the probability distribution of precipitation intensity also calls for innovative bias-correction methods to be developed for the application of the dataset when bias correction is required. High-quality meteorological observation over the region is needed for both forcing high-resolution climate simulation and conducting verification. The high-resolution downscaled climate simulations provide abundant opportunities both for investigating local-scale atmospheric dynamics and for studying climate impacts on hydrology, agriculture, and ecosystems.","[Li, Yanping; Li, Zhenhua; Zhang, Zhe; Chen, Liang; Kurkute, Sopan; Scaff, Lucia; Pan, Xicai] Univ Saskatchewan, Global Inst Water Secur, Saskatoon, SK, Canada; [Li, Yanping; Zhang, Zhe; Kurkute, Sopan; Scaff, Lucia] Univ Saskatchewan, Sch Environm & Sustainabil, Saskatoon, SK, Canada; [Chen, Liang] Chinese Acad Sci, Inst Atmospher Phys, CAS Key Lab Reg Climate Environm Temp East Asia, Beijing, Peoples R China; [Pan, Xicai] Chinese Acad Sci, Inst Soil Sci, Nanjing, Jiangsu, Peoples R China",,"Li, YP; Li, ZH (corresponding author), Univ Saskatchewan, Global Inst Water Secur, Saskatoon, SK, Canada.; Li, YP (corresponding author), Univ Saskatchewan, Sch Environm & Sustainabil, Saskatoon, SK, Canada.",yanping.li@usask.ca; zhenhua.li@usask.ca,,,Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of CanadaNatural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada (NSERC)CGIAR,This research has been supported by the Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada (projects Changing Cold Regions Network (CCRN) and Global Water Future).,,53,27,27,3,19,COPERNICUS GESELLSCHAFT MBH,GOTTINGEN,"BAHNHOFSALLEE 1E, GOTTINGEN, 37081, GERMANY",1027-5606,1607-7938,,HYDROL EARTH SYST SC,Hydrol.

The objective of this paper is to characterize uncertainty induced to water temperature forecasts by meteorological inputs in two hydrological contexts. Daily ensemble water temperature forecasts were produced using the CEQUEAU model for the Nechako (regulated) and Southwest Miramichi (natural) Rivers for 1-5-day horizons. The results demonstrate that a larger uncertainty is propagated to the thermal forecast in the unregulated river (0.92-3.14 degrees C) than on the regulated river (0.73-2.29 degrees C). Better performances were observed on the Nechako with a mean continuous ranked probability score (MCRPS) <0.85 degrees C for all horizons compared to the Southwest Miramichi (MCRPS approximate to 1 degrees C). While informing the end-user on future thermal conditions, the ensemble forecasts provide an assessment of the associated uncertainty and offer an additional tool to river managers for decision-making.","[Ouellet-Proulx, Sebastien; St-Hilaire, Andre] Canadian Rivers Inst, 490 Rue Couronne, Quebec City, PQ G1K 9A9, Canada; [Ouellet-Proulx, Sebastien; St-Hilaire, Andre] INRS ETE, 490 Rue Couronne, Quebec City, PQ G1K 9A9, Canada; [Boucher, Marie-Amelie] Univ Quebec Chicoutimi, 555 Blvd Univ, Chicoutimi, PQ G7H 2B1, Canada",,"Ouellet-Proulx, S (corresponding author), Canadian Rivers Inst, 490 Rue Couronne, Quebec City, PQ G1K 9A9, Canada.; Ouellet-Proulx, S (corresponding author), INRS ETE, 490 Rue Couronne, Quebec City, PQ G1K 9A9, Canada.",sebastien.ouellet-proulx@ete.inrs.ca; andre.st-hilaire@ete.inrs.ca; marie-amelie_boucher@uqac.ca,"Ouellet-Proulx, Sébastien/AAP-5479-2021; St-Hilaire, André/W-7120-2019","Boucher, Marie-Amelie/0000-0002-4246-2444; St-Hilaire, Andre/0000-0001-8443-5885; Ouellet-Proulx, Sebastien/0000-0003-3816-6340; St-Hilaire, Andre/0000-0001-9161-4742",NSERCNatural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada (NSERC); Rio Tinto,"This work was funded in part by NSERC and Rio Tinto.

This is particularly true in Alaska, where remote basins and a spatially and temporally sparse gaging network plague efforts to understand and forecast the hydrology of subarctic boreal basins and where climate change is leading to rapid shifts in basin function. In this study, the operational framework employed by the United States (US) National Weather Service, including the Alaska Pacific River Forecast Center, is adapted to integrate Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) remotely sensed observations of fractional snow cover area (fSCA) to determine if these data improve streamflow forecasts in interior Alaska river basins. Two versions of MODIS fSCA are tested against a base case extent of snow cover derived by aerial depletion curves: the MODIS 10A1 (MOD10A1) and the MODIS Snow Cover Area and Grain size (MODSCAG) product over the period 2000-2010. Observed runoff is compared to simulated runoff to calibrate both iterations of the model. MODIS-forced simulations have improved snow depletion timing compared with snow telemetry sites in the basins, with discernable increases in skill for the streamflow simulations. The MODSCAG fSCA version provides moderate increases in skill but is similar to the MOD10A1 results. The basins with the largest improvement in streamflow simulations have the sparsest streamflow observations. Considering the numerous low-quality gages (discontinuous, short, or unreliable) and ungauged systems throughout the high-latitude regions of the globe, this result is valuable and indicates the utility of the MODIS fSCA data in these regions. Additionally, while improvements in predicted discharge values are subtle, the snow model better represents the physical conditions of the snowpack and therefore provides more robust simulations, which are consistent with the US National Weather Service's move toward a physically based National Water Model. Physically based models may also be more capable of adapting to changing climates than statistical models corrected to past regimes. This work provides direction for both the Alaska Pacific River Forecast Center and other forecast centers across the US to implement remote-sensing observations within their operational framework, to refine the representation of snow, and to improve streamflow forecasting skill in basins with few or poor-quality observations.","[Bennett, Katrina E.; Cherry, Jessica E.] Univ Alaska, Int Arctic Res Ctr, Fairbanks, AK 99775 USA; [Bennett, Katrina E.; Cherry, Jessica E.] Univ Alaska, Water & Environm Res Ctr, Fairbanks, AK 99775 USA; [Cherry, Jessica E.; Lindsey, Scott] Alaska Pacific River Forecast Ctr, Anchorage, AK 99502 USA; [Balk, Ben] Deltares USA, Silver Spring, MD 20910 USA; [Bennett, Katrina E.] Los Alamos Natl Lab, Earth & Environm Sci, Los Alamos, NM 87545 USA",,"Bennett, KE (corresponding author), Univ Alaska, Int Arctic Res Ctr, Fairbanks, AK 99775 USA.; Bennett, KE (corresponding author), Univ Alaska, Water & Environm Res Ctr, Fairbanks, AK 99775 USA.; Bennett, KE (corresponding author), Los Alamos Natl Lab, Earth & Environm Sci, Los Alamos, NM 87545 USA.",kbennett@lanl.gov,"Bennett, Katrina/AAE-6105-2019","Bennett, Katrina/0000-0003-2433-8607","Alaska Climate Science Center; Natural Science and Engineering Research Council of CanadaNatural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada (NSERC); DOE Office of Science, Biological and Environmental Research program, Next Generation Ecosystem Experiment, NGEE-Arctic projectUnited States Department of Energy (DOE); GOES-R High Latitude Proving Ground award [NA08OAR432075]","Katrina E.

Hence, this study focuses on how to integrate current status assessment, trend prediction, and cause diagnosis in river health to guide early warning decision-making in river protection and management. This study has presented a three-phase approach by coupling spatial with nonspatial information in a highly systematic and reliable way, and an early warning system has been designed. In phase I, the current health status is assessed and nowcasted by using the order degree of each indicator. In phase II, health predictors, including the single perspective-based health index (HI) (e.g., water quality index (WQI) and index of biotic integrity (IBI)) and multi-perspective-based health index, have been forecasted under normal conditions or emerging conditions using predictive models. In phase III, key causal factors threatening the river health have been identified to enable early notification and to address unexpected events before occurrence. Although different modeling methods can be used in each phase to demonstrate this concept, we tested the model of partial least square regression (PLSR) associated with time series. Additionally, the three-phase approach has been integrated with geographic information system (GIS) and a decision support system (DSS) to develop a river health prediction and early warning system (RHP-EWS), an automatic prediction and decision-making tool. This tool was implemented to deal with the landing of typhoon Maria in 2018 into the Shanxi River watershed in China. Because of the timely responses and decisions, the drinking water supply was not influenced. However, the models should be extended to other river systems for testing and improvement at different temporal or spatial scales.","[Chen, Yongming; Sun, Zhilin] Zhejiang Univ, Coll Civil Engn & Architecture, An Zhong Bldg,866,Yuhangtang Rd, Hangzhou 310058, Zhejiang, Peoples R China; [Xia, Jihong; Cai, Wangwei; Dou, Chuanbing] Hohai Univ, Coll Agr Engn, 1 Xikang Rd, Nanjing 210098, Jiangsu, Peoples R China",,"Xia, JH (corresponding author), Hohai Univ, Coll Agr Engn, 1 Xikang Rd, Nanjing 210098, Jiangsu, Peoples R China.",jhccym@zjwater.gov.cn; syjhxia@hhu.edu.cn; cwwfromhhu@hhu.edu.cn; oceansun@zju.edu.cn; doucb@hhu.edu.cn,,,"Nation Key R AMP; D Program of China [2018YFD0900805]; National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC) [41471069]; andWater Resource Technology Foundation of Zhejiang Province, China [RA1104, RC1527]","This research was funded by Nation Key R & D Program of China (2018YFD0900805), National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC) (41471069), andWater Resource Technology Foundation of Zhejiang Province, China (RA1104, RC1527).",,38,1,1,2,9,MDPI,BASEL,"ST ALBAN-ANLAGE 66, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND",,2076-3417,,APPL SCI-BASEL,Appl.

Directly correcting the bias of forecasts using the relative change between forecast and control simulations has been shown to marginalize hydrologic uncertainty, reduce model bias, and remove systematic variance when predicting mean monthly and mean annual streamflow, prompting our investigation for maxima streamflow. We assess the variance structure of streamflow maxima using realizations of emission scenario, global climate model type and project phase, downscaling methods, bias correction, extreme value methods, and hydrologic model inputs and parameterization. Results show that the relative change of streamflow maxima was not dependent on systematic variance from the annual maxima versus peak over threshold method applied, albeit we stress that researchers strictly adhere to rules from extreme value theory when applying the peak over threshold method. Regardless of which method is applied, extreme value model fitting does add variance to the projection, and the variance is an increasing function of the return period. Unlike the relative change of mean streamflow, results show that the variance of the maxima's relative change was dependent on all climate model factors tested as well as hydrologic model inputs and calibration. Ensemble projections forecast an increase of streamflow maxima for 2050 with pronounced forecast standard error, including an increase of +30 (+/- 21), +38(+/- 34) and +51(+/- 85)% for 2, 20 and 100 year streamflow events for the wet temperate region studied.

This work proposes a post-processing method for addressing both bias correction and total uncertainty quantification for daily forecasts of water quality parameters derived from dynamical lake models. The post-processing is implemented based on a Bayesian Joint Probability (BJP) modeling approach. The BJP model uses a log-sinh transformation to normalize the raw forecasts and corresponding observations, and uses a bivariate Gaussian distribution to characterize the dependence relationship. The posterior distribution of the transformation parameters is inferenced through Metropolis Monte Carlo Markov chain sampling; it generates unbiased probabilistic forecasts that account for uncertainties from all sources. The BJP is used to post-processing raw daily forecasts of dissolved oxygen (DO), ammonium nitrogen (NH), total phosphorus (TP) and total nitrogen (TN) concentrations of Lake Chaohu, the fifth largest lake in China with lead times from 0 to 5 days. Results suggest that an average 93.1% forecast bias has been removed by BJP. The root mean square error in probability skill scores range from 5.8% for NH to 68.2% for TP, and the nonparametric bootstrapping test suggests that 67.7% forecasts are significantly improved averaged across all sampling sites, water quality parameters and lead times. The probabilities of the calibrated forecasts are reasonably consistent with the observed relative frequencies, and have appropriate spread and thus correctly quantify forecast uncertainty. The BJP post-processing method used in this study can be a useful operational tool that help to better realize the potential of water quality forecasts derived from dynamical models.

Interactions between local climate and the surrounding landscape result in patterns of hydrology that are unique to temporary wetlands. These seasonal and annual fluctuations in wetland inundation contribute to community composition and richness. Thus, predicting wetland community responses to environmental change is tied to the ability to predict wetland hydroregime. Detailed monitoring of wetland hydroregime is resource-intensive, limiting the scope and scale of forecasting. As an alternative, we determine which freely available measures of water availability best predict one component of wetland hydroregime, habitat suitability (i.e., the predictability of water in a wetland) within and among geographic regions. We used data from three North American regions to determine the climate index that best explained year-to-year variation in habitat suitability during a key phenological periodamphibian breeding. We demonstrate that simple, short-term climate indices based solely on precipitation data best predict habitat suitability in vernal pools in the northeast, montane wetlands in the west and coastal plain wetlands in the southeast. These relationships can help understand how changes in short-term precipitation patterns as a result of climate change may influence the overall hydroregime, and resulting biodiversity, of temporary wetlands across disparate biomes.","[Davis, Courtney L.; Miller, David A.

Although monthly streamflow time series are statistic, they also exhibit seasonal and periodic patterns. Using maximum Burg entropy, maximum configurational entropy and minimum relative entropy, the forecasting models for monthly streamflow series were constructed for five hydrological stations in northwest China. The evaluation criteria of average relative error (RE), root mean square error (RMSE), correlation coefficient (R) and determination coefficient (DC) were selected as performance metrics. Results indicated that the RESA model had the highest forecasting accuracy, followed by the CESA model. However, the BESA model had the highest forecasting accuracy in a low-flow period, and the prediction accuracies of RESA and CESA models in the flood season were relatively higher. In future research, these entropy spectral analysis methods can further be applied to other rivers to verify the applicability in the forecasting of monthly streamflow in China.","[Zhang, Gengxi; Zhou, Zhenghong; Su, Xiaoling] Northwest A&F Univ, Coll Water Resources & Architectural Engn, Yangling 712100, Shaanxi, Peoples R China; [Zhang, Gengxi; Su, Xiaoling] Northwest A&F Univ, Minist Educ, Key Lab Agr Soil & Water Engn Arid & Semiarid Are, Yangling 712100, Shaanxi, Peoples R China; [Ayantobo, Olusola O.] Fed Univ Agr, Dept Water Resources Management & Agr Meteorol, PMB 2240, Abeokuta 110282, Nigeria",,"Su, XL (corresponding author), Northwest A&F Univ, Coll Water Resources & Architectural Engn, Yangling 712100, Shaanxi, Peoples R China.; Su, XL (corresponding author), Northwest A&F Univ, Minist Educ, Key Lab Agr Soil & Water Engn Arid & Semiarid Are, Yangling 712100, Shaanxi, Peoples R China.",gengxizhang@nwsuaf.edu.cn; zzh199302@nwsuaf.edu.cn; xiaolingsu@nwsuaf.edu.cn; ayantobooo@funaab.edu.ng,,"Zhang, Gengxi/0000-0002-8218-8910",National Natural Science Fund in ChinaNational Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC) [51879222]; National Key Research and Development Program of China [2016YFC0401306],We are grateful for the grant support from the National Natural Science Fund in China (Project No. 51879222) and The National Key Research and Development Program of China (Project No. 2016YFC0401306).,,19,3,3,3,7,MDPI,BASEL,"ST ALBAN-ANLAGE 66, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND",1099-4300,,,ENTROPY-SWITZ,Entropy,FEB,2019,21,2,,,,,,,132,10.3390/e21020132,,,13,"Physics, Multidisciplinary",Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),Physics,HO2JZ,WOS:000460742200033,33266848,"Green Published, gold, Green Submitted",,,2022-02-17

However, invader impacts are context-dependent, making reliable and robust predictions challenging. In particular, it is unclear how temporal variabilities in relation to temperature regime shifts influence invader ecological impacts. In the present study, we quantify the functional responses of three coexisting freshwater fishes: the native freshwater River Goby Glossogobius callidus, and the non-native Mozambique Tilapia Oreochromis mossambicus and Western Mosquitofish Gambusia affinis, under two temperature treatments using chironomid larvae as prey. This was used along with fish abundance data to determine temporal differences in ecological impacts of each fish species between seasons (i.e. at two corresponding temperatures). All three fish species exhibited potentially population-destabilizing Type II functional responses. Their maximum feeding rates were consistently higher in the warm temperature treatment, whereas attack rates tended to be reduced. Non-native Mozambique Tilapia had the highest maximum feeding rate under both temperature treatments (18 degrees C and 25 degrees C), followed by the non-native Western Mosquitofish and lastly the native River Goby, suggesting greater per capita impacts on native prey by non-native fishes. The predatory fish abundances differed significantly according to season, with native River Goby and non-native Mozambique Tilapia generally more abundant than non-native Western Mosquitofish. By multiplying functional response maximum feeding rates with abundances of each fish species across the seasonal gradient, the relative impact potential of non-native Mozambique Tilapia was consistently higher compared to that of native gobies. Western Mosquitofish impacts were less apparent, owing to their low abundances. We demonstrate how seasonal temperature fluctuations affect the relative impact capacities of introduced species and the utility of consumer functional response and the relative impact potential metric in impact forecasting.","[Mofu, Lubabalo; Weyl, Olaf L.

Reservoir storage is affected by drought, which hampers the ability to provide water for irrigation and hydropower. Despite the need for reservoir storage prediction for planning and decision-making, a reservoir storage forecast system at 1- to 3-month lead has been lacking for major reservoirs in India. Here we evaluate the potential of observed accumulated precipitation, standardized precipitation index (SPI), standardized precipitation evapotranspiration index (SPEI), standardized streamflow index (SSI), and observed reservoir storage to provide reservoir storage anomaly forecast at 1- to 3-month lead for the dry season (February to May) using a statistical approach. We find that accumulated precipitation for 3-11 months is strongly associated with the monthly reservoir storage anomalies in India. Moreover, accumulated precipitation and observed reservoir storage provide a reasonable (R-2 = 0.7) forecast skill for reservoir storage anomalies at 1- to 3-month lead. Similarly, SPI and SPEI can be used to predict reservoir storage anomalies at 1- to 3-month lead in India. Since the prediction skill from SPI and SPEI is similar, reservoir storage at monthly timescale is largely affected by accumulated precipitation instead of variability in air temperature. We find that the forecast skill for the 1-month lead from SPI, SPEI, and SSI is similar for Indira Sagar (Narmada) and Minimata (Mahanadi) reservoirs; however, prediction skill for reservoir storage anomalies improves substantially using SSI for 2- to 3-month lead. Reservoir storage anomalies forecast at 1- to 3-month lead can be valuable for water management-related decision-making and planning during the dry season in India.","[Tiwari, Amar Deep; Mishra, Vimal] Indian Inst Technol IIT Gandhinagar, Civil Engn, Gandhinagar, India",,"Mishra, V (corresponding author), Indian Inst Technol IIT Gandhinagar, Civil Engn, Gandhinagar, India.",vmishra@iitgn.ac.in,,"Mishra, Vimal/0000-0002-3046-6296; Tiwari, Amar Deep/0000-0003-1649-8889",MHRD; MoWR,"Authors acknowledge data availability from IMD, CHIRPS, and GEFS.

Hence, appropriate selection of GCMs and downscaling methods is important for assessing the impacts of climate change. To explicitly explore the influences of multi-GCMs and different downscaling methods on climate change projection in various climate zones, the Heihe River Basin (HRB) and the Zhanghe River Basin (ZRB) were selected in this study to represent the north arid region and the south humid region in China, respectively. We first evaluated the performance of multi-GCMs derived from Coupled Model Inter-comparison Project Phase 5 (CMIP5) in the two regions based on in-situ measurements and the 40 year European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts (ECMWF) Re-Analysis (ERA-40) data. Subsequently, to construct appropriate climate change projection techniques, comparative analysis using two statistical downscaling methods was performed with consideration of the significant north-south meteorological discrepancies. Consequently, specific projections of future climate change for 2021-2050 under three representative concentration pathway (RCP) scenarios (RCP2.6, RCP4.5, and RCP8.5) were completed for the HRB and ZRB, including daily precipitation, maximum air temperature, and minimum air temperature. The results demonstrated that the score-based method with multiple criteria for performance evaluation of multiple GCMs more accurately captured the spatio-temporal characteristics of the regional climate. The two statistical downscaling methods showed respective advantages in arid and humid regions. The statistical downscaling model (SDSM) showed more accurate prediction capacities for air temperature in the arid-climate HRB, whereas model output statistics (MOS) better captured the probability distribution of precipitation in the ZRB, which is characterized by a humid climate. According to the results obtained in this study, the selection of appropriate GCMs and downscaling methods for specific climate zones with different meteorological features significantly impact regional climate change projection. The statistical downscaling models developed and recommended for the north and south of China in this study provide scientific reference for sustainable water resource management subject to climate change.","[Lun, Yurui; Liu, Liu; Wang, Ruotong; Huang, Guanhua] China Agr Univ, Coll Water Resources & Civil Engn, Beijing 100083, Peoples R China; [Liu, Liu; Huang, Guanhua] China Agr Univ, Ctr Agr Water Res China, Beijing 100083, Peoples R China; [Huang, Guanhua] China Agr Univ, Chinese Israeli Int Ctr Res & Training Agr, Beijing 100083, Peoples R China",,"Liu, L (corresponding author), China Agr Univ, Coll Water Resources & Civil Engn, Beijing 100083, Peoples R China.; Liu, L (corresponding author), China Agr Univ, Ctr Agr Water Res China, Beijing 100083, Peoples R China.",S20193091590@cau.edu.cn; liuliu@cau.edu.cn; hy96980308@cau.edu.cn; ghuang@cau.edu.cn,,"Liu, Liu/0000-0002-4915-206X","National Key Research and Development Programs of China [2018YFC1508702, 2017YFC0403201]; National Natural Science Foundation of ChinaNational Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC) [91425302]","This research was financially supported by the National Key Research and Development Programs of China (No. 2018YFC1508702, 2017YFC0403201), with additional partial support from the National Natural Science Foundation of China (No. 91425302).",,79,2,2,6,14,MDPI,BASEL,"ST ALBAN-ANLAGE 66, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND",,2073-4441,,WATER-SUI,Water,NOV,2020,12,11,,,,,,,3106,10.3390/w12113106,,,35,Environmental Sciences; Water Resources,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),Environmental Sciences & Ecology; Water Resources,OY2ZF,WOS:000594118800001,,gold,,,2022-02-17

For the first time, we demonstrate that initial hydrological conditions informed by satellite-based terrestrial water storage (TWS) estimates improve seasonal streamflow forecasts. TWS variability detected by the Gravity Recovery and Climate Experiment (GRACE) satellites is assimilated into a land surface model during 2003-2016 and used to initialize 6-month hindcasts (i.e., forecasts of past events) during West Africa's wet seasons. We find that GRACE data assimilation (DA) generally increases groundwater and soil moisture storage in the region, resulting in increased evapotranspiration and reduced total runoff. Total runoff is particularly lower at the headwaters of the Niger River, positively impacting streamflow simulations and hindcast initializations. Compared to simulations without GRACE-DA, hindcasts are notably improved at locations draining from large basin areas, in particular, over the Niger River basin, which is consistent with GRACE's coarse spatial resolution. The long memory of groundwater and deep soil moisture, two main TWS components updated by GRACE-DA, is reflected in prolonged improvements in the streamflow hindcasts. Model accuracy at Niamey, Niger, the most populated city where streamflow observations are available, improved up to 33% during the flood season. These new findings directly contribute to ongoing developments in food security, flood potential forecast, and water-related disaster warning systems for Africa.","[Getirana, Augusto; Jung, Hahn Chul; Arsenault, Kristi; Kumar, Sujay; Peters-Lidard, Christa] NASA, Hydrol Sci Lab, Goddard Space Flight Ctr, Greenbelt, MD 20771 USA; [Getirana, Augusto] Univ Maryland, Earth Syst Sci Interdisciplinary Ctr, College Pk, MD 20742 USA; [Jung, Hahn Chul] Sci Syst & Applicat Inc, Lanham, MD USA; [Arsenault, Kristi] Sci Applicat Int Corp, Reston, VA USA; [Shukla, Shraddhanand] Univ Calif Santa Barbara, Climate Hazards Ctr, Santa Barbara, CA 93106 USA; [Maigari, Issoufou; Mamane, Bako] Ctr Reg AGRHYMET, Niamey, Niger",,"Getirana, A (corresponding author), NASA, Hydrol Sci Lab, Goddard Space Flight Ctr, Greenbelt, MD 20771 USA.; Getirana, A (corresponding author), Univ Maryland, Earth Syst Sci Interdisciplinary Ctr, College Pk, MD 20742 USA.",augusto.getirana@nasa.gov,"Peters-Lidard, Christa D/E-1429-2012","Peters-Lidard, Christa D/0000-0003-1255-2876",NASANational Aeronautics & Space Administration (NASA),"This study was funded by NASA's Applied Sciences Programs-SERVIR and Water Resources.

Low levels of dissolved oxygen may lead to oxygen depletion (called hypoxia), putting at high risk the survival of aquatic organisms. Identifying the environmental conditions inducing hypoxia is therefore a topic of high ecological importance. In this study, we used four machine learning algorithms (Extreme Gradient Boosting (XGBoost), Extremely Randomized Trees (EXT), Random Forest, and Logistic Regression) to forecast hypoxia in a lagoon, considering different time lags (2,5,10 and 20-days). To do so, we used data on dissolved oxygen and a total of nine physicochemical and meteorological variables from Papas lagoon, Greece during 2015-2018. Key drivers and synergies that increase the risk of hypoxia were identified using the Shapley Additive explanations (SHAP) methodology. EXT was slightly superior to the other algorithms in forecasting hypoxia, achieving a success between 89% and 94% with pH, water temperature, chlorophyll and salinity as top explanatory variables. SHAP showed that the synergistic effect of low pH and chlorophyll, and elevated water temperature and salinity tended to favor conditions leading to hypoxia. SHAP also illustrated that diverse synergies of the explanatory variables can induce hypoxia, indicating the complex and nonlinear relationships between environmental factors and hypoxia. Overall, the present approach may be proved useful for the development of a reliable forecasting tool for alarming hypoxia and, ultimately, the effective monitoring of the lagoon.","[Politikos, Dimitris, V] Hellen Ctr Marine Res, Inst Marine Biol Resources & Inland Waters, Argyroupoli 16452, Greece; [Petasis, Georgios] Natl Ctr Sci Res Demokritos, Inst Informat & Telecommun, Aghia Paraskevi 60228, Greece; [Katselis, George] Univ Patras, Dept Anim Prod Fisheries & Aquaculture, Mesolongi 30200, Greece",,"Politikos, DV (corresponding author), Hellen Ctr Marine Res, Inst Marine Biol Resources & Inland Waters, Argyroupoli 16452, Greece.",dimpolit@hcmr.gr,,,,,,68,0,0,6,6,ELSEVIER,AMSTERDAM,"RADARWEG 29, 1043 NX AMSTERDAM, NETHERLANDS",1574-9541,1878-0512,,ECOL INFORM,Ecol.

This paper aims to quantify to what extent WLF will change under climate warming and to propose a practical forecasting model for WLF predictions. The new concept of cumulative watershed temperature (CWT) is used as a convenient lumped surrogate for complicated hydrological processes that influence WLF. Statistical analyses of century-long flow data from the Fraser River in British Columbia, Canada show a strong dependence of WLF on CWT. In winter season, time series of CWT and WLF are shown to each divide into a falling and a rising limb at the data point of their lowest values, being -358 degrees C and 827 m3/s (historical averages), respectively. The falling and rising limbs describe the cumulative freezing and thawing effects of air temperatures fluctuating around the freezing point on WLF changes. The correlation between CWT and WLF (time series) data points on the rising limbs forms the forecasting model, expressing WLF as a function of CWT in terms of their z-scores. The model takes input of Global Circulation Model (GCM) projections of temperature increases by the end of 21st century under different Representative Concentration Pathways (RCPs), and predicts changes of Fraser River WLF from the historical average. RCP4.5 causes a 22.6% increase (ensemble average from six GCMs). RCP8.5 increases WLF by 20% (for some future years) to 44% (for others). The methods reported in this paper can be adapted to other cold regions.","[Kochukrishnan, Aneesh; Li, S.

A water crisis is marked by a severe shortage of water resources and deteriorating water quality. As an important component of water resources, lake water quality has deteriorated rapidly in the context of fast urbanization and climate change. This deterioration has altered the water ecosystem structure and influenced lake functionality. To curb these trends, various strategies and procedures have been used in many urban lakes. Among these procedures, accurate and responsive water environment monitoring is the basis of the forecasting and prevention of large-scale cyanobacteria outbreaks and improvement of water quality. To dynamically monitor and predict the outbreak of cyanobacteria in Dianchi Lake, in this study, wireless sensors networks (WSNs) and the geographic information system(GIS) are used tomonitor water quality at the macro-scale and meso-scale. Historical, real-time water quality and weather condition data were collected, and a combination prediction model (adaptive grey model (AGM) and back propagation artificial neural network (BPANN)) was proposed. The correlation coefficient (R) of the simulation experiment reached 0.995. Moreover, we conducted an empirical experiment in Dianchi Lake, Yunnan, China using the proposed method. R was 0.93, and the predicting error was 4.77. The results of the experiment suggest that our model has good performance for water quality prediction and can forecast cyanobacteria outbreaks.

The propensity to misestimate flood risk is expected to rise because climate change ensures the past will be a poor predictor of the future. Greater reliance on downscaled climatological and hydrological forecasts has been suggested to address these information failures. This article combines stochastic dynamic programming with historical data and climate-driven streamflow projections to determine how changes in flood risk forecasts influence optimal investments in flood mitigation infrastructure. Using upgrades in California's levee system as an example, we show that climate change is causing benefit-cost analysis to become increasingly biased in favor of flood mitigation infrastructure projects. We also show that using downscaled hydroclimate forecasts to achieve more accurate estimates of flood risk can decrease the efficiency of flood mitigation infrastructure investments, if flood risk is currently overestimated.

Moreover, there is none or limited inclusion of ANN inputs coupled with atmospheric circulation under various patterns arising from the need of data downscaling for climate change predictions in hydrology domain. This paper presents the results of a novel multi-stage methodology for selecting input variables used in artificial neural network (ANN) models for river flow forecasting. The proposed methodology makes use of data correlations together with a set of crucial statistical indices for optimizing model performance, both in terms of ANN structure (e. g. neurons, momentum rate, learning rate, activation functions, etc), but also in terms of inputs selection. The latter include various previous time steps of daily areal precipitation and temperature data coupled with atmospheric circulation in the form of circulation patterns, observed river flow data and time expressed via functions of sine and cosine. Additionally, the non-linear behavior between river flow and the respective inputs is investigated by the ANN configuration itself and not only by correlation indices (or other equivalent contingency tools). The proposed methodology revealed the river flow of past four days, the precipitation of past three days and the seasonality as robust input variables. However, the temperature of three past days should be considered as an alternative against the seasonality. The produced models forecasting ability was validated by comparing its one-step ahead flow prediction ability to two other approaches (an auto regressive model and a genetic algorithm (GA)-optimized single input ANN).","[Panagoulia, D.] Natl Tech Univ Athens, Dept Water Resources & Environm Engn, Sch Civil Engn, 5 Heroon Polytechniou Str, Athens 15780, Greece; [Tsekouras, G.

However, decision-makers lack guidance on how such rain-on-snow (ROS) flood risk may respond to climate change. Here, daily ROS events with flood-generating potential(8) are simulated over western North America for a historical (2000-2013) and future (forced under Representative Concentration Pathway 8.5(9)) period with the Weather Research and Forecasting model; 4 km resolution allows the basin-scale ROS flood risk to be assessed. In the warmer climate, we show that ROS becomes less frequent at lower elevations due to snowpack declines, particularly in warmer areas (for example, the Pacific maritime region). By contrast, at higher elevations where seasonal snowcover persists, ROS becomes more frequent due to a shift from snowfall to rain. Accordingly, the water available for runoff(10) increases for 55% of western North American river basins, with corresponding increases in flood risk of 20-200%, the greatest changes of which are projected for the Sierra Nevada, the Colorado River headwaters and the Canadian Rocky Mountains. Thus, flood control and water resource planning must consider ROS to fully quantify changes in flood risk with anthropogenic warming.","[Musselman, Keith N.] Univ Colorado, Inst Arctic & Alpine Res, Boulder, CO 80309 USA; [Lehner, Flavio; Ikeda, Kyoko; Clark, Martyn P.; Prein, Andreas F.; Liu, Changhai; Barlage, Mike; Rasmussen, Roy] Natl Ctr Atmospher Res, POB 3000, Boulder, CO 80307 USA",,"Musselman, KN (corresponding author), Univ Colorado, Inst Arctic & Alpine Res, Boulder, CO 80309 USA.",keith.musselman@colorado.edu,"Musselman, Keith N./AAK-2552-2021; Ikeda, Kyoko/AAH-5593-2020; Clark, Martyn/AAH-9999-2020; Prein, Andreas/N-4928-2017","Musselman, Keith N./0000-0001-8394-491X; Clark, Martyn/0000-0002-2186-2625; Prein, Andreas/0000-0001-6250-179X; Lehner, Flavio/0000-0003-4632-9701",National Science Foundation (NSF)National Science Foundation (NSF); NCAR Advanced Study Program (ASP) Postdoctoral Fellowship; Postdoc Applying Climate Expertise (PACE) fellowship; National Oceanic and Atmospheric AdministrationNational Oceanic Atmospheric Admin (NOAA) - USA; Bureau of Reclamation; NSFNational Science Foundation (NSF),"The National Center for Atmospheric Research (NCAR) is sponsored by the National Science Foundation (NSF).

Thus, this work is an attempt to develop an efficient model using support vector machine (SVM) to predict the water quality of Langat River Basin through the analysis of the data of six parameters of dual reservoirs that are located in the catchment. The proposed model could be considered as an effective tool for identifying the water quality status for the river catchment area. In addition, the major advantage of the proposed model is that it could be useful for ungauged catchments or those lacking enough numbers of monitoring stations for water quality parameters. These parameters, namely pH, Suspended Solids (SS), Dissolved Oxygen (DO), Ammonia Nitrogen (AN), Chemical Oxygen Demand (COD), and Biochemical Oxygen Demand (BOD) were provided by the Malaysian Department of Environment (DOE). The differences between dual scenarios 1 and 2 depend on the information from prior stations to forecast DO levels for succeeding sites (Scenario 2). This scheme has the capacity to simulate water-quality accurately, with small prediction errors. The resulting correlation coefficient has maximum values of 0.998 and 0.979 after the application of Scenario 1. The approach with Type 1 SVM regression along with 10-fold cross-validation methods worked to generate precise results.

This is particularly important in regional areas of Australia where rivers can play a critical role in irrigated agriculture, recreation and social wellbeing, major floods and sustainable environments. There are several hydrological parameters that effect stream flows in rivers and a major challenge with any prediction methodology, is to understand these parameter interdependencies, correlations and their individual effects. A robust methodology is, thus, required for accurate prediction of streamflow under usually unique, waterway-specific conditions using available data. This research employs an approach based on Artificial Neural Network (ANN) to provide this robust methodology.

An understanding of flood forecasting and its potential forecast uncertainty is essential for water resource managers. Reliable forecasting may provide future streamflow information to assist in an assessment of the benefits of reservoirs and the risk of flood disasters. However, deterministic forecasting models are not able to provide forecast uncertainty information. To quantify the forecast uncertainty, a variational Bayesian neural network (VBNN) model for ensemble flood forecasting is proposed in this study. In VBNN, the posterior distribution is approximated by the variational distribution, which can avoid the heavy computational costs in the traditional Bayesian neural network. To transform the model parameters' uncertainty into the model output uncertainty, a Monte Carlo sample is applied to give ensemble forecast results. The proposed method is verified by a flood forecasting case study on the upper Yangtze River. A point forecasting model neural network and two probabilistic forecasting models, including hidden Markov Model and Gaussian process regression, are also applied to compare with the proposed model. The experimental results show that the VBNN performs better than other comparable models in terms of both accuracy and reliability. Finally, the result of uncertainty estimation shows that the VBNN can effectively handle heteroscedastic flood streamflow data.","[Qin, Hui; Liu, Yongqi; Xie, Wei; Liu, Guanjun; Zhou, Jianzhong] Huazhong Univ Sci & Technol, Sch Hydropower & Informat Engn, Wuhan 430074, Peoples R China; [Zhan, Xiaoyan] China Southern Power Grid Power Generat Co, Guangzhou 510663, Peoples R China; [Yao, Liqiang] Changjiang Water Resources Commiss, Changjiang River Sci Res Inst, Wuhan 430074, Peoples R China",,"Qin, H (corresponding author), Huazhong Univ Sci & Technol, Sch Hydropower & Informat Engn, Wuhan 430074, Peoples R China.",xyz_csp@163.com; hqin@hust.edu.cn; yongqil@hust.edu.cn; d201880952@hust.edu.cn; M201973841@hust.edu.cn; d202081167@hust.edu.cn; xiewei@hust.edu.cn,,"Guanjun, Liu/0000-0003-2918-0087",National Key R&D Program of China [2017YFC0405900]; National Natural Science Foundation of ChinaNational Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC) [51979113]; National Public Research Institutes for Basic R&D Operating Expenses Special Project [CKSF2017061/SZ],"This work is supported by the National Key R&D Program of China (2017YFC0405900), the National Natural Science Foundation of China (no. 51979113), the National Public Research Institutes for Basic R&D Operating Expenses Special Project (CKSF2017061/SZ), and special thanks are given to the anonymous reviewers and editors for their constructive comments.",,31,3,3,13,21,MDPI,BASEL,"ST ALBAN-ANLAGE 66, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND",,2073-4441,,WATER-SUI,Water,OCT,2020,12,10,,,,,,,2740,10.3390/w12102740,,,15,Environmental Sciences; Water Resources,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),Environmental Sciences & Ecology; Water Resources,ON9BO,WOS:000586986900001,,gold,,,2022-02-17

Reliable river flow forecasting is highly emphasized to support major decision-makers. This research paper adopts a new implementation approach for the application of a river flow prediction model for hourly prediction of the flow of Mary River in Australia; a novel data-intelligent model called emotional neural network (ENN) was used for this purpose. A historical dataset measured over a 4-year period (2011-2014) at hourly timescale was used in building the ENN-based predictive model. The results of the ENN model were validated against the existing approaches such as the minimax probability machine regression (MPMR), relevance vector machine (RVM), and multivariate adaptive regression splines (MARS) models. The developed models are evaluated against each other for validation purposes. Various numerical and graphical performance evaluators are conducted to assess the predictability of the proposed ENN and the competitive benchmark models. The ENN model, used as an objective simulation tool, revealed an outstanding performance when applied for hourly river flow prediction in comparison with the other benchmark models. However, the order of the model, performance wise, is ENN > MARS > RVM > MPMR. In general, the present results of the proposed ENN model reveal a promising modeling strategy for the hourly simulation of river flow, and such a model can be explored further for its ability to contribute to the state-of-the-art of river engineering and water resources monitoring and future prediction at near real-time forecast horizons.","[Cui, Fang] Baoji Univ Art & Sci, Key Lab Disasters Monitoring & Mech Simulating Sh, Baoji 721013, Shannxi, Peoples R China; [Cui, Fang] Baoji Univ Art & Sci, Geog & Environm Dept, Baoji 721013, Shannxi, Peoples R China; [Salih, Sinan Q.] Duy Tan Univ, Inst Res & Dev, Da Nang 550000, Vietnam; [Salih, Sinan Q.] Dijlah Univ Coll, Comp Sci Dept, Baghdad, Iraq; [Choubin, Bahram] AREEO, West Azarbaijan Agr & Nat Resources Res & Educ Ct, Soil Conservat & Watershed Management Res Dept, Orumiyeh, Iran; [Bhagat, Suraj Kumar; Yaseen, Zaher Mundher] Ton Duc Thang Univ, Fac Civil Engn, Ho Chi Minh City, Vietnam; [Samui, Pijush] Natl Inst Technol Patna, Dept Civil Engn, Patna, Bihar, India",,"Yaseen, ZM (corresponding author), Ton Duc Thang Univ, Fac Civil Engn, Ho Chi Minh City, Vietnam.",cuifangchina@163.com; sinanq.salih@duytan.edu.vn; b.choubin@areeo.ac.ir; surajenv@gmail.com; pijushsamui@gmail.com; yaseen@tdtu.edu.vn,"Choubin, Bahram/C-4892-2017; Yaseen, Zaher Mundher/G-7029-2018; Salih, Sinan/F-6284-2019; Bhagat, Suraj Kumar/AAB-6737-2020; samui, pijush/W-5860-2019","Choubin, Bahram/0000-0001-6350-7157; Yaseen, Zaher Mundher/0000-0003-3647-7137; Salih, Sinan/0000-0003-0717-7506; Bhagat, Suraj Kumar/0000-0001-9971-3155; ",,,,68,4,4,2,14,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0167-6369,1573-2959,,ENVIRON MONIT ASSESS,Environ.

The real-time prediction system of river water level can provide early warning information to the decision-makers of relevant departments in time, which plays an important role in reducing flood risk. Aiming at the rapid and strong response of urban river to rainfall, a real-time rolling prediction system of urban river water level is proposed based on radar rainfall prediction products and coupling model of hydrology and hydrodynamics. In the system, each simulation is divided into two parts: the review period and the prediction period. In the review period, the river model is driven by the observed rainfall to obtain the latest simulation state to avoid cumulative error, while in the prediction period, the radar rainfall is used to drive in the short-term prediction of river water level. Taking Fuzhou as the research area, a long series review of the process from April 1, 2020 to October 1, 2020 was carried out. The accuracy of the river model, radar-rainfall and prediction system during the study period are evaluated and discussed in detail. The results show that the river model can simulate the process of water level change in rainfall and rain free period. The performance of radar rainfall to total rainfall prediction is better than that of process prediction. The real-time prediction system can give the water level risk according to each radar forecast rainfall process, and has good performance in judging the peak water level and peak time, which can provide reference for urban river dispatching decision-makers.","[Liu, Yu; Wang, Hao] Beijing Univ Technol, Fac Architecture Civil & Transportat Engn, Beijing 100124, Peoples R China; [Wang, Hao; Lei, Xiaohui] China Inst Water Resources & Hydropower Res, State Key Lab Simulat & Regulat Water Cycle River, Beijing 100038, Peoples R China",,"Lei, XH (corresponding author), China Inst Water Resources & Hydropower Res, State Key Lab Simulat & Regulat Water Cycle River, Beijing 100038, Peoples R China.",lxh@iwhr.com,,,National Natural Science Foundation of ChinaNational Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC) [51779268],This work was supported by the National Natural Science Foundation of China (Grant No. 51779268).,,43,2,2,5,5,ELSEVIER,AMSTERDAM,"RADARWEG 29, 1043 NX AMSTERDAM, NETHERLANDS",0022-1694,1879-2707,,J HYDROL,J.

For this combination the Bayesian model averaging (BMA) approach, the nonhomogeneous Gaussian regression (NGR), also known as the ensemble model output statistic (EMOS) techniques, and a novel method called Beta-transformed linear pooling (BLP) will be applied. By the help of the quantile score (QS) and the continuous ranked probability score (CRPS), the combination results for the Sihl River in Switzerland with about 5 years of forecast data will be compared and the differences between the raw and optimally combined forecasts will be highlighted.

The recurrent neural network (RNN) was adopted for comparison to verify the superiority of the LSTM model in terms of time series prediction problems. The results of LSTM were also compared with a widely used process-based model, the Xinanjiang model (XAJ), as a benchmark to test the applicability of this novel method. The results suggest that LSTM could provide comparable quality predictions as the XAJ model and can be considered an efficient hydrology modeling approach. A real-time forecasting approach coupled with the k-nearest neighbor (KNN) algorithm as an updating method was proposed in this study to generalize the plausibility of the LSTM method for flood forecasting in a decision support system.

Real time control decisions suffer from streamflow forecast uncertainty. This study aims to use Probabilistic Streamflow Forecasts (PSFs) having a lead-time up to 48 h as input for the recurrent reservoir operation problem. A related technique for decision making is multi-stage stochastic optimization using scenario trees, referred to as Tree-based Model Predictive Control (TB-MPC). Deterministic Streamflow Forecasts (DSFs) are provided by applying random perturbations on perfect data. PSFs are synthetically generated from DSFs by a new approach which explicitly presents dynamic uncertainty evolution. We assessed different variables in the generation of stochasticity and compared the results using different scenarios. The developed real-time hourly flood control was applied to a test case which had limited reservoir storage and restricted downstream condition. According to hindcasting closed-loop experiment results, TB-MPC outperforms the deterministic counterpart in terms of decreased downstream flood risk according to different independent forecast scenarios. TB-MPC was also tested considering different number of tree branches, forecast horizons, and different inflow conditions. We conclude that using synthetic PSFs in TB-MPC can provide more robust solutions against forecast uncertainty by resolution of uncertainty in trees.","[Uysal, Goekcen; Alvarado-Montero, Rodolfo; Schwanenberg, Dirk] Univ Duisburg Essen, Inst Hydraul Engn & Water Resources Management, D-45141 Essen, Germany; [Uysal, Goekcen; Sensoy, Aynur] Anadolu Univ, Dept Civil Engn, TR-26555 Eskisehir, Turkey; [Alvarado-Montero, Rodolfo] Deltares, Operat Water Management, Rotterdamseweg 185, NL-26 MH Delft, Netherlands; [Schwanenberg, Dirk] KISTERS AG, Business Unit, Pascalstr, D-52076 Aachen, Germany",,"Uysal, G (corresponding author), Univ Duisburg Essen, Inst Hydraul Engn & Water Resources Management, D-45141 Essen, Germany.; Uysal, G (corresponding author), Anadolu Univ, Dept Civil Engn, TR-26555 Eskisehir, Turkey.",gokcenuysal@anadolu.edu.tr; AlvaradoMontero@deltares.nl; Dirk.Schwanenberg@kisters.de; asensoy@anadolu.edu.tr,"Sensoy, Aynur/E-6040-2019; Uysal, Gokcen/E-6763-2019","Sensoy, Aynur/0000-0003-3004-4912; Uysal, Gokcen/0000-0003-0445-060X","Scientific and Technological Research Council of Turkey (TUBITAK)Turkiye Bilimsel ve Teknolojik Arastirma Kurumu (TUBITAK) [2214A]; Anadolu University Scientific Research Projects CommissionAnadolu University [1506F502, 1705F189]",The first author would like to thank The Scientific and Technological Research Council of Turkey (TUBITAK) for the scholarship (2214A program).

Secondly, the partial autocorrelation function (PACF) values are explored to identify the inputs for the artificial neural network (ANN) models. Thirdly, the weights and biases of the ANN architecture are tuned and optimized by the multi-verse optimizer (MVO) algorithm. Finally, the simulated streamflow is obtained using the well-trained MVO-ANN model. The proposed hybrid model has been applied to annual streamflow observations from four hydrological stations in the upper reaches of the Yangtze River, China. Parallel experiments using non-denoising models, the back propagation neural network (BPNN) and the ANN optimized by the particle swarm optimization algorithm (PSO-ANN) have been designed and conducted to compare with the proposed model.

The successful development of forecast-based policies should integrate uncertainty from modern forecast products to create unambiguous rules that can be tested on out-of-sample periods. This study investigates the potential for such operating policies to improve water supply efficiency while maintaining flood protection, combining state-of-the-art weather hindcasts with downstream conjunctive use to transfer surplus flood releases to groundwater storage. Because available weather hindcasts are relatively short (10-20 years), we propose a novel statistical framework to develop synthetic forecasts over longer periods of the historical record. Operating rules are trained with a recently developed policy search framework in which decision rules are structured as binary trees. Policies are developed for a range of scenarios with varying forecast skill and conjunctive use capacity, using Folsom Reservoir, California, as a case study. Results suggest that the combination of conjunctive use and short-term weather forecasts can substantially improve both water supply and flood control objectives by allowing storage to remain high until forecasts trigger a release. Further, increased conjunctive use capacity reduces the importance of forecast skill, since surface storage can be moved to groundwater during the flood season without losing water supply. This analysis serves the development of forecast-based operating policies for large, multipurpose reservoirs in California and other regions with similar flood hydroclimatology.","[Nayak, Munir Ahmad; Steinschneider, Scott] Cornell Univ, Dept Biol & Environm Engn, Ithaca, NY 14853 USA; [Nayak, Munir Ahmad] Indian Inst Technol Indore, Discipline Civil Engn, Indore, Madhya Pradesh, India; [Herman, Jonathan D.] Univ Calif Davis, Dept Civil & Environm Engn, Davis, CA 95616 USA",,"Steinschneider, S (corresponding author), Cornell Univ, Dept Biol & Environm Engn, Ithaca, NY 14853 USA.",ss3378@cornell.edu,"Herman, Jonathan D/M-9079-2017","Herman, Jonathan D/0000-0002-4081-3175; Nayak, Munir/0000-0003-2764-3623","U.S. National Science FoundationNational Science Foundation (NSF) [CBET-1803589, CBET-1803563, CNS-1639268]","This work was partially supported by the U.S. National Science Foundation grants CBET-1803589, CBET-1803563, and CNS-1639268.

Logistic regression analyses were performed using the outbreak or non-outbreak of 2-MIB (2-MIB(+ / -)) as the dependent variable and water quality parameters as the independent variables. The results suggested that the density of 2-MIB-producing cyanobacteria was higher when (1) dissolved inorganic nitrogen concentrations were low under the relaxation of phosphorus limitation and/or (2) salinity or micronutrient concentrations were high. In addition, we successfully developed forecasting models with a high predictive power that determined 2-MIB(+ / -) in August-December using only two water quality parameters: dissolved inorganic phosphate and pH in April and total nitrogen/total phosphorous and salinity in May.","[Shizuka, Kazunori] Aomori Prefectural Ind Technol Res Ctr, Inland Water Fisheries Res Inst, 344-10 Shiraue, Towada, Aomori 0340041, Japan; [Shizuka, Kazunori] Kitasato Univ, Grad Sch Vet Sci, 23-35-1 Higashi, Towada, Aomori 0348628, Japan; [Maie, Nagamitsu; Kakino, Wataru; Taruya, Hiroyuki; Tanji, Hajime] Kitasato Univ, Sch Vet Med, 23-35-1 Higashi, Towada, Aomori 0348628, Japan",,"Shizuka, K (corresponding author), Aomori Prefectural Ind Technol Res Ctr, Inland Water Fisheries Res Inst, 344-10 Shiraue, Towada, Aomori 0340041, Japan.; Maie, N (corresponding author), Kitasato Univ, Sch Vet Med, 23-35-1 Higashi, Towada, Aomori 0348628, Japan.",kazunori_shizuka@aomori-itc.or.jp; maie@vmas.kitasato-u.ac.jp,,"Maie, Nagamitsu/0000-0001-9450-061X; Shizuka, Kazunori/0000-0003-2206-3814","JSPS KAKENHIMinistry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology, Japan (MEXT)Japan Society for the Promotion of ScienceGrants-in-Aid for Scientific Research (KAKENHI) [15K07532]",This work was supported by JSPS KAKENHI Grant Number 15K07532.,,50,0,0,5,14,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0167-6369,1573-2959,,ENVIRON MONIT ASSESS,Environ.

The forecasting sensitivity to changes in the exogenous input parameters and time series length was also assessed. For Kreutz Creek at Strickler station (Pennsylvania), the prediction accuracy increased with the number of exogenous input variables, with the best performance achieved considering all the variables (R-2 = 0.77). The predictions were accurate also for the Raccoon River (Iowa), although only the water discharge was considered exogenous input (South Raccoon River at Redfield-R-2 = 0.94).

Human translocations as well as rising temperatures have allowed freshwater fish species to expand their distribution into novel ecosystems, often with negative effects on native biodiversity. Early intervention is key to restricting damage and further spread of invasive aliens. This makes identification of areas with high risk for the establishment of invasive alien species necessary in order to target monitoring and mitigation measures. Here, we model lake-specific likelihood of establishment of five freshwater fish species which are increasing their distribution in Norway. In order to establish the likelihood of establishment resulting from human translocation, environmental factors or natural dispersal from an established population, a suite of anthropogenic and environmental covariates were included as predictors. We used these models to create a future scenario which modelled establishment risk for these species over a 50-year time period. Connectivity of lakes to other extant populations and anthropogenic covariates influenced likelihood of establishment-and subsequently future establishment risk-the most across all species. The effects of temperature were variable, and for the most part had little effect on likelihood of establishment. Our results indicate that human behaviour, infrastructure development and alternations of watershed connectivity are more important than climate induced range shifts on a short to medium time horizon. Synthesis and applications. Our study demonstrates how risk assessments of invasive establishment can be synthesised based on readily available open data sources. This allows for the construction of tools to forecast invasion hotspots as a basis for designing mitigation actions, including early monitoring programs, horizon scanning initiatives and eradication measures. It also allows managers to determine where species are spreading as a result of direct human translocation, and where they are expanding as a result of increased temperatures.","[Perrin, Sam Wenaas; Finstad, Anders Gravbrot] Norwegian Univ Sci & Technol, Dept Nat Hist, Trondheim, Norway; [Perrin, Sam Wenaas; Finstad, Anders Gravbrot] Norwegian Univ Sci & Technol, Ctr Biodivers Dynam, Trondheim, Norway; [Baerum, Kim Magnus; Helland, Ingeborg Palm] Norwegian Inst Nat Res, Trondheim, Norway",,"Perrin, SW (corresponding author), Norwegian Univ Sci & Technol, Dept Nat Hist, Trondheim, Norway.; Perrin, SW (corresponding author), Norwegian Univ Sci & Technol, Ctr Biodivers Dynam, Trondheim, Norway.",sam.perrin@ntnu.no,"Finstad, Anders Gravbrot/H-6519-2015; Helland, Ingeborg Palm/B-5615-2008","Finstad, Anders Gravbrot/0000-0003-4529-6266; Perrin, Sam Wenaas/0000-0002-1266-1573; Helland, Ingeborg Palm/0000-0001-7380-3152",,,,56,1,1,6,6,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0021-8901,1365-2664,,J APPL ECOL,J.

The impact of hydrological changes caused by expected land use changes may be severe for the Wami river system, given its role as a crucial area for water, providing food and livelihoods. The objective of this study is to examine the influence of land use changes on various elements of the hydrological processes of the basin. Hybrid classification, which includes unsupervised and supervised classification techniques, is used to process the images (2000 and 2016), while CA-Markov chain analysis is used to forecast and simulate the 2032 land use state. In the current study, a combined approach-including a Soil and Water Assessment Tool (SWAT) model and Partial Least Squares Regression (PLSR)-is used to explore the influences of individual land use classes on fluctuations in the hydrological components. From the study, it is evident that land use has changed across the basin since 2000 (which is expected to continue in 2032), as well as that the hydrological effects caused by land use changes were observed. It has been found that the major land use changes that affected hydrology components in the basin were expansion of cultivation land, built-up area and grassland, and decline in natural forests and woodland during the study period. These findings provide baseline information for decision-makers and stakeholders concerning land and water resources for better planning and management decisions in the basin resources' use.","[Twisa, Sekela] United Nat Univ, Inst Integrated Management Mat Fluxes & Resources, Ammonstr 74, D-01067 Dresden, Germany; [Twisa, Sekela; Buchroithner, Manfred E.] Tech Univ Dresden, Inst Cartog, D-01062 Dresden, Germany; [Kazumba, Shija] Dar Es Salaam Inst Technol, POB 2958, Dar Es Salaam, Tanzania; [Kurian, Mathew] Penn State Univ, Global Programs, State Coll, PA 16801 USA",,"Twisa, S (corresponding author), United Nat Univ, Inst Integrated Management Mat Fluxes & Resources, Ammonstr 74, D-01067 Dresden, Germany.; Twisa, S (corresponding author), Tech Univ Dresden, Inst Cartog, D-01062 Dresden, Germany.",twisa@unu.edu; kazumba98@yahoo.com; mathewkurian@psu.edu; manfred.buchroithner@tu-dresden.de,,"Buchroithner, Manfred/0000-0002-6051-2249; Twisa, Sekela/0000-0002-3203-1229",Ministry ofWater; United Republic of Tanzania; Dresden University of Technology (TU Dresden),This research was funded by the Ministry ofWater; the United Republic of Tanzania and the APC was funded by Dresden University of Technology (TU Dresden).,,99,5,5,1,3,MDPI,BASEL,"ST ALBAN-ANLAGE 66, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND",,2306-5338,,HYDROLOGY-BASEL,Hydrology,MAR,2020,7,1,,,,,,,17,10.3390/hydrology7010017,,,18,Water Resources,Emerging Sources Citation Index (ESCI),Water Resources,LB0PU,WOS:000524340800002,,gold,,,2022-02-17

There are a considerable number of forecasting models and techniques that have been employed in streamflow forecasting and gained importance in hydrological studies in recent decades. In this study, the main objective was to compare the accuracy of four data-driven techniques of Linear Regression (LR), Multilayer Perceptron (MLP), Support Vector Machine (SVM), and Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) network in daily streamflow forecasting. For this purpose, three scenarios were defined based on historical precipitation and streamflow series for 26 years of the Kentucky River basin located in eastern Kentucky, US. Statistical criteria including the coefficient of correlation (R), Nash-Sutcliff coefficient of efficiency (E), Nash-Sutcliff for High flow (E-H), Nash-Sutcliff for Low flow (E-L), normalized root mean square error (NRMSE), relative error in estimating maximum flow (REmax), threshold statistics (TS), and average absolute relative error (AARE) were employed to compare the performances of these methods. The results show that the LSTM network outperforms the other models in forecasting daily streamflow with the lowest values of NRMSE and the highest values of E-H, E-L, and R under all scenarios. These findings indicated that the LSTM is a robust data-driven technique to characterize the time series behaviors in hydrological modeling applications.","[Rahimzad, Maryam] Univ Isfahan, Fac Civil Engn & Transportat, Dept Geomat Engn, Esfahan, Iran; [Moghaddam Nia, Alireza] Univ Tehran, Fac Nat Resources, Dept Reclamat Arid & Mountainous Reg, Karaj, Iran; [Zolfonoon, Hosam] Univ Coimbra, DEEC, INESC Coimbra, Coimbra, Portugal; [Soltani, Jaber] Univ Tehran, Dept Water Engn, Aburaihan Campus, Pakdasht, Iran; [Danandeh Mehr, Ali] Antalya Bilim Univ, Dept Civil Engn, Antalya, Turkey; [Kwon, Hyun-Han] Sejong Univ, Dept Civil & Environm Engn, Seoul, South Korea",,"Nia, AM (corresponding author), Univ Tehran, Fac Nat Resources, Dept Reclamat Arid & Mountainous Reg, Karaj, Iran.",maryamrahimzad74@trn.ui.ac.ir; a.moghaddamnia@ut.ac.ir; hosam.zolfonoon@student.dec.uc.pt; Jsoltani@ut.ac.ir; ali.danandeh@antalya.edu.tr; hkwon@sejong.ac.kr,"Soltani, Jaber/ABD-2202-2021; Nia, Alireza Moghaddam/AAZ-7100-2021; Rahimzad, Maryam/ABB-6583-2021","Rahimzad, Maryam/0000-0001-5650-6359; Kwon, Hyun-Han/0000-0003-4465-2708",,,,72,0,0,27,27,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0920-4741,1573-1650,,WATER RESOUR MANAG,Water Resour.

To evaluate the direct effects of climate change on the transport and accumulation of nitrale-N, we developed an integrated modeling framework combining climatic change, nitrate-N infiltration in the unsaturated zone, and groundwater level fluctuations. The study was based on a center-pivot irrigated corn field at the Nebraska Management Systems Evaluation Area (MSEA) site. Future groundwater recharge (GR) and actual evapotranspiration (ETa) rates were predicted via an inverse vadose zone modeling approach by using climatic data generated by the Weather Research and Forecasting (WRF) climate model under the RCP 8.5 scenario, which was downscaled from the global CCSM4 model to a resolution of 24 km by 24 km. A groundwater flow model was first calibrated on the basis of historical groundwater table measurements and then applied to predict the future groundwater table in 2057-2060. Finally, the predicted future GR rate, ETa rate, and groundwater level, together with future precipitation data from the WRF climate model, were used in a three-dimensional (3D) model to predict nitrate-N concentrations in tire subsurface (saturated and unsaturated parts) from 2057 to 2060. The future GR was predicted to decrease in the study area, as compared with the average GR data from the literature. Correspondingly, the groundwater level was predicted to decrease (30 to 60 cm) over the 5 years of simulation in the future. The nitrate-N mass in the simulation domain was predicted to increase but at a slower rate than in the past. Sensitivity analysis indicated that the accumulation of nitrate-N is sensitive to groundwater table elevation changes and irrigation rates. (C) 2019 Elsevier B.V.

Quantitative prediction of rainfall time series is extremely challenging as compared to other meteorological parameters due to its variability in local features that involves temporal and spatial scales. Consequently, this requires a highly complex system having an advance model to accurately capture the highly non linear processes occurring in the climate. The focus of this work is direct prediction of multistep forecasting, where a separate time series model for each forecasting horizon is considered and forecasts are computed using observed data samples. Forecasting in this method is performed by proposing a deep learning approach, i.e, Temporal Deep Belief Network (DBN). The best model is selected from several baseline models on the basis of performance analysis metrics. The results suggest that the temporal DBN model outperforms the conventional Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) specifically on rainfall time series forecasting. According to our experimentation, a modified DBN with hidden layes (300-200-100-10) performs best with 4.59E-05, 0.0068 and 0.94 values of MSE, RMSE and R value respectively on testing samples. However, we found that training DBN is more exhaustive and computationally intensive than other deep learning architectures. Findings of this research can be further utilized as basis for the advance forecasting of other weather parameters with same climate conditions.","[Narejo, Sanam; Jawaid, Muhammad Moazzam; Talpur, Shahnawaz; Baloch, Rizwan] Mehran Univ Engn & Technol, Dept Comp Syst, Jamshoro, Sindh, Pakistan; [Pasero, Eros Gian Alessandro] Politecn Torino, Dept Elect & Telecommun DET, Turin, Italy",,"Narejo, S (corresponding author), Mehran Univ Engn & Technol, Dept Comp Syst, Jamshoro, Sindh, Pakistan.",sanam.narejo@faculty.muet.edu.pk,,"NAREJO, SANAM/0000-0002-3537-8949",,,,62,0,0,4,8,PEERJ INC,LONDON,"341-345 OLD ST, THIRD FLR, LONDON, EC1V 9LL, ENGLAND",2376-5992,,,PEERJ COMPUT SCI,PeerJ Comput.

It was indicated relatively high rainfall situations during May and October while low rainfall situations during January and February by occurring flood situation in once per five year. During Yala season the area will be received comparatively more rainfall (331mm) than Maha season (300mm) in future. Community and the farmers in this area can be aware about the anticipated spatial distribution of total monthly rainfall during two major seasons and flood occurrence periods. Decision makers should evaluate land suitability of Bentota area by considering above climatological influences and its spatial distribution pattern that identified as major outcome of this research. The approach and the methodology adopted in this study will be useful for other researchers, agriculturalist and planners to identify the future climatological influences and its spatial distribution pattern for land suitability evaluations and other decision making purposes for other areas.","[Ranasinghe, Gayani] Univ Moratuwa, Dept Town & Country Planning, Moratuwa, Sri Lanka; [Piyadasa, Ranjana U.

To this end, a regional hydrological ensemble prediction system (RHEPS) is assembled and implemented. The RHEPS in this case comprises the ensemble meteorological forcing, a distributed hydrological model, and a statistical postprocessor. As the meteorological forcing, precipitation, and near-surface temperature outputs from the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA)/National Centers for Environmental Prediction (NCEP) 11-member Global Ensemble Forecast System Reforecast, version 2 (GEFSRv2), are used. The Hydrology Laboratory Research Distributed Hydrologic Model (HL-RDHM) is used as the distributed hydrological model, and a statistical autoregressive model with an exogenous variable is used as the postprocessor. To verify streamflow forecasts from the RHEPS, eight river basins in the MAR are selected, ranging in drainage area from; 262 to 29 965 km(2) and covering some of the major rivers in the MAR. The verification results for the RHEPS show that, at the initial lead times (1-3 days), the hydrological uncertainties have more impact on forecast skill than the meteorological ones. The former become less pronounced, and the meteorological uncertainties dominate, across longer lead times (> 3 days). Nonetheless, the ensemble streamflow forecasts remain skillful for lead times of up to 7 days. Additionally, postprocessing increases forecast skills across lead times and spatial scales, particularly for the high-flow conditions. Overall, the proposed RHEPS is able to improve streamflow forecasting in the MAR relative to the deterministic (unperturbed GEFSRv2 member) forecasting case.","[Siddique, Ridwan; Mejia, Alfonso] Penn State Univ, Dept Civil & Environm Engn, University Pk, PA 16802 USA",,"Mejia, A (corresponding author), Penn State Univ, Dept Civil & Environm Engn, University Pk, PA 16802 USA.",amejia@engr.psu.edu,,"Mejia, Alfonso/0000-0003-3891-1822",NOAA/NWSNational Oceanic Atmospheric Admin (NOAA) - USA [NA14NWS4680012],We gratefully acknowledge the suggestions and comments provided by the two anonymous reviewers.

This paper focuses on the consideration of base and fast flow for the forecasting of seasonal streamflow. Taking the three tributaries of the Pearl River in South China as case study, five forecasting experiments, which forecast the average daily flow in the three-month period by using the average daily flow in the antecedent month, are devised to elucidate the different roles of base, fast, and total flow. The recursive digital filter (RDF) model is employed for the separation of base flow from fast flow; the Bayesian joint probability (BJP) model is applied to generate ensemble forecasts under cross validation; and the Schaake shuffle is used to establish temporal structure to link ensemble members when adding up forecasts of base flow and fast flow. Forecasts in the different experiments are evaluated in terms of bias, reliability, and skill, and the relationship between correlation coefficient and forecast skill is illustrated. The results show that unbiased and reliable seasonal forecasts are generally obtained in the experiments. Correlation coefficients of base flow are overall higher than those of total flow while correlation coefficients of fast flow are lower. Forecast skill tends to increase with correlation coefficient. Meanwhile, fast flow can lead to extremely large total flow in the antecedent month, which can substantially enlarge the forecasts and diminish the forecast skill when the corresponding observation is not as large. By contrast, base flow tends to always contribute to forecast skill. The separation of base flow from fast flow, which accounts for the different dynamical processes of fast and base flow, can reduce the impact of fast flow and improve the forecast skill of total flow.","[Huang, Zeqing; Zhao, Tongtiegang; Liu, Yang; Lin, Kairong; Chen, Xiaohong] Sun Yat Sen Univ, Ctr Water Resources & Environm, Sch Civil Engn, Southern Marine Sci & Engn Guangdong Lab, Guangzhou 510275, Peoples R China; [Zhang, Yongyong] Chinese Acad Sci, Inst Geog Sci & Nat Resources Res, Key Lab Water Cycle & Related Land Surface Proc, Beijing 100101, Peoples R China; [Jiang, Tao] Sun Yat Sen Univ, Sch Geog & Planning, Guangzhou 510275, Peoples R China",,"Zhao, TTG (corresponding author), Sun Yat Sen Univ, Ctr Water Resources & Environm, Sch Civil Engn, Southern Marine Sci & Engn Guangdong Lab, Guangzhou 510275, Peoples R China.",zhaottg@mail.sysu.edu.cn,"Zhang, Yongyong/I-9367-2014","Zhang, Yongyong/0000-0001-9159-9626; Zhao, Tongtiegang/0000-0001-6943-258X; chen, xiaohong/0000-0003-0809-5297; Lin, Kairong/0000-0001-6533-3357","Ministry of Science and Technology of ChinaMinistry of Science and Technology, China [2017YFC0405900]; Natural Science Foundation of ChinaNational Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC) [51979295, 51861125203, 51822908, U1911204]; Guangdong Provincial Department of Science and Technology [2019ZT08G090]; Water Science and Technology Innovation Project of Guangdong [2020-27]","This study is supported by the Ministry of Science and Technology of China (2017YFC0405900), the Natural Science Foundation of China (51979295, 51861125203, 51822908, and U1911204), and the Guangdong Provincial Department of Science and Technology (2019ZT08G090), and the Water Science and Technology Innovation Project of Guangdong (2020-27).",,81,4,4,3,10,ELSEVIER,AMSTERDAM,"RADARWEG 29, 1043 NX AMSTERDAM, NETHERLANDS",0022-1694,1879-2707,,J HYDROL,J.

However, accurately predicting streamflow is challenging due to the non-stationary characteristics of hydrologic processes and the effects of noise. To improve monthly streamflow forecasting, this study proposes a data-driven model based on a double-processing strategy, which combines singular spectrum analysis (SSA), improved complete ensemble empirical mode decomposition with adaptive noise (ICEEMDAN) and extreme learning machine (ELM) approaches. In the proposed double-processing model, called SSA-ICEEMDAN-ELM, the original streamflow series are first processed via SSA for denoising; then, the processed series are reprocessed via ICEEMDAN to decompose them into relatively stationary sub-series; finally, these sub-series are modelled using ELM. The performance of the proposed model is tested for one-month-ahead prediction using streamflow data from the Caojiahu and Shibalipu reservoirs in the Gulang River Basin. In addition, the proposed double-processing model is compared with four single-processing models, namely, empirical mode decomposition (EMD)-ELM, ensemble EMD (EEMD)-ELM, ICEEMDAN-ELM and SSA-ELM, and two single models without any processing, namely, autoregressive integrated moving average (ARIMA) and ELM. The results show that: (a) the four single-processing models have higher prediction accuracy than the single models, and the performance of the SSA-ELM model is the best of these single-processing models, implying that noise in hydrological series cannot be ignored; (b) the proposed SSA-ICEEMDAN-ELM model is superior to the single-processing models and single models, demonstrating that the double-processing approach can further improve streamflow prediction accuracy. Thus, the proposed model, which is a promising method that is expected to benefit reservoir management, can better reduce the influence of noise and capture the dynamic characteristics of hydrological series.","[Wang, Lili; Ma, Chunfeng] Chinese Acad Sci, Northwest Inst Ecoenvironm & Resources, Key Lab Remote Sensing Gansu Prov, Lanzhou 730000, Gansu, Peoples R China; [Wang, Lili; Bai, Yulong] Northwest Normal Univ, Coll Phys & Elect Engn, Lanzhou 730070, Gansu, Peoples R China; [Wang, Lili] Univ Chinese Acad Sci, Beijing 100049, Peoples R China; [Li, Xin] Chinese Acad Sci, Inst Tibetan Plateau Res, Beijing 100101, Peoples R China; [Li, Xin] Chinese Acad Sci, CAS Ctr Excellence Tibetan Plateau Earth Sci, Beijing 100101, Peoples R China",,"Li, X (corresponding author), Chinese Acad Sci, Inst Tibetan Plateau Res, Beijing 100101, Peoples R China.; Li, X (corresponding author), Chinese Acad Sci, CAS Ctr Excellence Tibetan Plateau Earth Sci, Beijing 100101, Peoples R China.",xinli@itpcas.ac.cn,"Ma, Chunfeng/N-4147-2019; Li, Xin/F-7473-2011; MA, Chunfeng/M-4467-2016","Ma, Chunfeng/0000-0003-2025-6030; Li, Xin/0000-0003-2999-9818; Wang, Lili/0000-0001-6401-264X","Strategic Priority Research Program of the Chinese Academy of SciencesChinese Academy of Sciences [XDA19070104, XDA20100104]; National Natural Science Foundation of ChinaNational Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC) [41630856]; 13th Five-year Informatization Plan of Chinese Academy of Sciences [XXH13505-06]","This study was supported by the Strategic Priority Research Program of the Chinese Academy of Sciences (grant no.

These models employ hydro-climatic information from a given year to predict the next year inflow. The Oros Reservoir is a key infrastructure in the water resources system of the state, where most rivers present very high temporal variability, which is a challenge for water managers. Streamflow forecast systems at the climate scale (months ahead) can be very useful for the challenging process of water allocation in the region. This paper explores the use of NHMMs to provide a probabilistic one-year ahead forecast of the mean annual flow for the Oros Reservoir. Results based on a forecast verification study based on 60 years of independent data show that NHMMs with two or three hidden states, employing the NINO3 climate index as exogenous variable, provides forecasts with an average value of the continuous ranked probability skill score of about 0.2-0.25, meaning that they are better than climatology. It is also evident that those models performed much better during dry years than during wet years, which may be related to lack of other climate indices.","[Hernandez Hernandez, Luis Carlos] Univ Brasilia, Dept Civil & Environm Engn, Environm Technol & Water Resources Grad Program, Brasilia, DF, Brazil; [Reis, Dirceu Silveira, Jr.] Univ Brasilia, Dept Civil & Environm Engn, Brasilia, DF, Brazil",,"Hernandez, LCH (corresponding author), Univ Brasilia, Dept Civil & Environm Engn, Environm Technol & Water Resources Grad Program, Brasilia, DF, Brazil.",flecks85@gmail.com; dirceu.reis@gmail.com,"Reis, Dirceu/ABB-1209-2020","Reis, Dirceu/0000-0003-1787-9763",Coordination for the Improvement of Higher Education Personnel (CAPES)Coordenacao de Aperfeicoamento de Pessoal de Nivel Superior (CAPES),"The first author would like to thank the Coordination for the Improvement of Higher Education Personnel (CAPES), which provide financial support for much of this rearch.

Hence the development of methods that can accurately forecast the suspended sediment loads from historical water data sets and infrequently or non-sampled rivers will greatly help in the management of water resources. One of the widely used methods employing empirical models are rating curves. Therefore, in this study, 12 sediment rating curves (SRCs) were developed from 14 years' historical data, one for each month of the year, to show the relationship between stream and suspended sediment flowing into Inanda Dam, Durban, South Africa. The developed monthly SRCs were evaluated using two performance assessment criteria, specifically RMSE and R-2. The performance of these SRC models was compared with those of the corresponding monthly developed genetic programming (GP) models for each month of the year. The results indicate that the predictions from the GP models are better than the predictions from the SRC models, especially in predicting large quantities of suspended sediment load during high streamflow such as during flood events.","[Jaiyeola, Adesoji Tunbosun] Mangosuthu Univ Technol, Fac Engn, Dept Civil Engn & Surveying, Durban, South Africa; [Adeyemo, Josiah] Univ Washington, Seattle Campus, Seattle, WA 98195 USA",,"Jaiyeola, AT (corresponding author), Mangosuthu Univ Technol, Fac Engn, Dept Civil Engn & Surveying, Durban, South Africa.",soj707@yahoo.com,"Adeyemo, Josiah/F-3285-2011","Adeyemo, Josiah/0000-0002-0497-4713; JAIYEOLA, ADESOJI TUNBOSUN/0000-0001-9199-1986",,,,31,2,2,0,1,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",2042-1338,2042-1346,,AFR J SCI TECHNOL IN,Afr.

In Australia, the Bayesian joint probability (BJP) statistical approach has been deployed by the Australian Bureau of Meteorology to provide seasonal streamflow forecasts across the country since 2010. Here we assess the BJP approach, using antecedent conditions and climate indices as predictors, to produce Kharif season (April-September) streamflow forecasts for inflow to Pakistan's two largest upper Indus Basin (UIB) water supply dams, Tarbela (on the Indus) and Mangla (on the Jhelum). For Mangla, we compare these BJP forecasts to (i) ensemble streamflow predictions (ESPs) from the snowmelt runoff model (SRM) and (ii) a hybrid approach using the BJP with SRM-ESP forecast means as an additional predictor. For Tarbela, we only assess BJP forecasts using antecedent and climate predictors as we did not have access to SRM for this location. Cross validation of the streamflow forecasts shows that the BJP approach using two predictors (March flow and an El Nino Southern Oscillation, ENSO, climate index) provides skilful probabilistic forecasts that are reliable in uncertainty spread for both Mangla and Tarbela. For Mangla, the SRM approach leads to forecasts that exhibit some bias and are unreliable in uncertainty spread, and the hybrid approach does not result in better forecast skill. Skill levels for Kharif (April-September), early Kharif (April-June) and late Kharif (July-September) BJP forecasts vary between the two locations. Forecasts for Mangla show high skill for early Kharif and moderate skill for all Kharif and late Kharif, whereas forecasts for Tarbela also show moderate skill for all Kharif and late Kharif, but low skill for early Kharif. The BJP approach is simple to apply, with small input data requirements and automated calibration and forecast generation. It offers a tool for rapid deployment at many locations across the UIB to provide probabilistic seasonal streamflow forecasts that can inform Pakistan's basin water management.","[Charles, Stephen P.] CSIRO Land & Water, Floreat 6014, Australia; [Wang, Quan J.] Univ Melbourne, Parkville, Vic 3010, Australia; [Ahmad, Mobin-ud-Din; Podger, Geoff] CSIRO Land & Water, Canberra, ACT 2601, Australia; [Hashmi, Danial] Water & Power Dev Author, Lahore, Pakistan; [Schepen, Andrew] CSIRO Land & Water, Dutton Pk 4102, Australia; [Robertson, David E.] CSIRO Land & Water, Clayton, Vic 3168, Australia",,"Charles, SP (corresponding author), CSIRO Land & Water, Floreat 6014, Australia.",steve.charles@csiro.au,"Robertson, David/C-3643-2011; Wang, Quan J/D-2674-2012; Schepen, Andrew/AAG-8880-2020; Ahmad, Mobin-ud-Din/A-1721-2012","Robertson, David/0000-0003-4230-8006; Wang, Quan J/0000-0002-8787-2738; Schepen, Andrew/0000-0002-6372-735X; Ahmad, Mobin-ud-Din/0000-0002-2905-5991",Pakistan Mission of the Australian Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade through the Sustainable Development Investment Portfolio Indus project; CSIRO through its Land and Water portfolio,"The Pakistan Mission of the Australian Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade provided funds for this study through the Sustainable Development Investment Portfolio Indus project.

In recent decades, persistent prediction errors for spring and summer runoff volumes have been observed in a number of watersheds in the American Southwest. While mostly driven by decadal precipitation trends, these errors also relate to the influence of increasing temperature on streamflow in these basins. Here we show that incorporating seasonal temperature forecasts from operational global climate prediction models into streamflow forecasting models adds prediction skill for watersheds in the headwaters of the Colorado and Rio Grande River basins. Current dynamical seasonal temperature forecasts now show sufficient skill to reduce streamflow forecast errors in snowmelt-driven regions. Such predictions can increase the resilience of streamflow forecasting and water management systems in the face of continuing warming as well as decadal-scale temperature variability and thus help to mitigate the impacts of climate nonstationarity on streamflow predictability.","[Lehner, Flavio; Wood, Andrew W.] Natl Ctr Atmospher Res, Res Applicat Lab, POB 3000, Boulder, CO 80307 USA; [Llewellyn, Dagmar] US Bur Reclamat, Albuquerque Area Off, Albuquerque, NM USA; [Blatchford, Douglas B.] US Bur Reclamat, Lower Colorado Reg Off, Boulder, CO USA; [Goodbody, Angus G.] Nat Resources Conservat Serv, Natl Water & Climate Ctr, Portland, OR USA; [Pappenberger, Florian] European Ctr Medium Range Weather Forecasts, Forecast Dept, Reading, Berks, England",,"Lehner, F (corresponding author), Natl Ctr Atmospher Res, Res Applicat Lab, POB 3000, Boulder, CO 80307 USA.",flehner@ucar.edu,"Pappenberger, Florian/A-2839-2009; Wood, Andrew/L-5133-2013","Pappenberger, Florian/0000-0003-1766-2898; Wood, Andrew/0000-0002-6231-0085; Lehner, Flavio/0000-0003-4632-9701",National Science FoundationNational Science Foundation (NSF); Postdoc Applying Climate Expertise (PACE) fellowship - NOAA Climate Program Office; Bureau of Reclamation; Reclamation [R11AC80816]; U.S. Army Corps of Engineers (USACE) Climate Preparedness and Resilience Program,"We thank Pablo A.

Therefore, a climate-driven streamflow forecasting (CDSF) framework was proposed to improve the runoff forecasting accuracy. This framework is realized by using principal component analysis (PCA), long short-term memory (LSTM) and Bayesian optimization (BO), referred to as PCA-LSTM-BO. To validate the effectiveness and superiority of the PCA-LSTM-BO method along with one autoregressive LSTM model and two other CDSF models based on PCA, BO, and either support vector regression (SVR) or gradient boosting regression trees (GBRT), namely, PCA-SVR-BO and PCA-GBRT-BO, respectively, were compared. A generalization performance index based on the Nash-Sutcliffe efficiency (NSE), called the GI(NSE) value, is proposed to evaluate the generalizability of the model. The results show that (1) the proposed model is significantly better than the other benchmark models in terms of the mean square error (MSE<=185.782), NSE>=0.819, and GI(NSE) <=0.223 for all the forecasting scenarios; (2) the PCA in the CDSF framework can improve the forecasting capacity and generalizability; (3) the CDSF framework is superior to the autoregressive LSTM models for all the forecasting scenarios; and (4) the GI(NSE) value is demonstrated to be effective in selecting the optimal model with better generalizability.","[Lian, Yani; Luo, Jungang; Zuo, Ganggang; Wei, Na] Xian Univ Technol, State Key Lab Ecohydraul Northwest Arid Reg, Xian 710048, Shaanxi, Peoples R China; [Wang, Jingmin] Project Construct Co Ltd, Hanjiang Weihe River Valley Water Divers, Xian 710100, Shaanxi, Peoples R China",,"Luo, JG (corresponding author), Xian Univ Technol, State Key Lab Ecohydraul Northwest Arid Reg, Xian 710048, Shaanxi, Peoples R China.",jgluo@xaut.edu.cn,,,"Natural Science Basic Research Program of Shaanxi [2019JLZ-15, 2017JQ5076]; National Natural Science Foundation of ChinaNational Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC) [51979221, 51679186]; Research Fund of the State Key Laboratory of Eco-hydraulics in Northwest Arid Region, Xi'an University of Technology [2019KJCXTD-5]; Special Scientific Research Program of Shaanxi Provincial Education Department [17JK0558]","This work was supported by the Natural Science Basic Research Program of Shaanxi (Grant No. 2019JLZ-15 and 2017JQ5076), the National Natural Science Foundation of China (Grant Nos. 51979221 and 51679186), the Research Fund of the State Key Laboratory of Eco-hydraulics in Northwest Arid Region, Xi'an University of Technology (Grant No. 2019KJCXTD-5) and the Special Scientific Research Program of Shaanxi Provincial Education Department (Grant No. 17JK0558).",,44,0,0,9,9,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0920-4741,1573-1650,,WATER RESOUR MANAG,Water Resour.

Thus, projecting the future evolution of hydrological extremes plays a crucial role in sustainable water management and agriculture development in a changing climate. In this study, we develop the high-resolution projections of multidimensional drought characteristics and flood risks using the convection-permitting Weather Research and Forecasting (WRF) model with the horizontal grid spacing of 4 km for the Blanco and Mission River basins over South Texas. Uncertainties in model parameters are addressed explicitly, thereby leading to probabilistic assessments of hydrological extremes. Our findings reveal that the probabilistic multivariate assessments of drought and flood risks can reduce the underestimation and the biased conclusions generated from the univariate assessment. Furthermore, our findings disclose that future droughts are expected to become more severe over South Texas even though the frequency of the occurrence of droughts is projected to decrease, especially for the long-term drought episodes. In addition, South Texas region is expected to experience more floods with an increasing river discharge. Moreover, the Blanco and Mission river basins will suffer from higher flood risks as flood return periods are expected to become longer under climate change.","[Qing, Y.; Wang, S.; Zhang, B.] Hong Kong Polytech Univ, Dept Land Surveying & Geoinformat, Hong Kong, Peoples R China; [Wang, S.] Hong Kong Polytech Univ, Shenzhen Res Inst, Shenzhen, Peoples R China; [Wang, Y.] Texas Tech Univ, Dept Geosci, Lubbock, TX 79409 USA",,"Wang, S (corresponding author), Hong Kong Polytech Univ, Dept Land Surveying & Geoinformat, Hong Kong, Peoples R China.; Wang, S (corresponding author), Hong Kong Polytech Univ, Shenzhen Res Inst, Shenzhen, Peoples R China.",shuo.s.wang@polyu.edu.hk,"Wang, Shuo/I-3017-2013","Wang, Shuo/0000-0001-7827-187X",National Natural Science Foundation of ChinaNational Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC) [51809223]; Hong Kong Polytechnic University Start-up Grant [1-ZE8S],This research was supported by the National Natural Science Foundation of China (Grant No. 51809223) and the Hong Kong Polytechnic University Start-up Grant (Grant No. 1-ZE8S).

Therefore, to prevent the depletion of groundwater resources in a small number of plains, it is essential that simulation and forecasting of groundwater levels be conducted. In this study, in order to predict the groundwater level of Khorramabad plain located in Iran using 5 AOGCM models under RCP85 scenario, meteorological parameters were predicted and analyzed. Then, the performances of hybrid models including Black Widow Spider-Support Vector Regression (BWO-SVR), WSVR, and AIG-SVR in estimating the groundwater level of the plain were investigated and evaluated based on the parameters of temperature, precipitation, and abstraction from the aquifers during the statistical years of 2000-2020. Upon the application of the selected hybrid model, the groundwater level was predicted within the statistical years 2021-2040. According to the results of climate change modeling, compared to the base period, the temperature parameter in future periods in all months would experience an increasing trend (about 1.68-2.79 degrees C). The results showed that the studied models have better performance in the structure consisting of all input parameters. Also, the results of the evaluation index showed that the WSVR model has less error than other models. In general, the results of groundwater level forecasting show that in the coming years, groundwater level drop is predicted to be about 1-1.5 m.","[Dehghani, Reza; Poudeh, Hassan Torabi; Izadi, Zohre] Lorestan Univ, Fac Agr, Water Engn Dept, Lorestan, Iran",,"Poudeh, HT (corresponding author), Lorestan Univ, Fac Agr, Water Engn Dept, Lorestan, Iran.",torabi.ha@lu.ac.ir,,,"University of Lorestan, Khorramabad, Iran [1]","The University of Lorestan, Khorramabad, Iran, supported our research work (Grant No. 1).",,90,0,0,0,0,ELSEVIER,AMSTERDAM,"RADARWEG 29, 1043 NX AMSTERDAM, NETHERLANDS",2352-801X,,,GROUNDWATER SUST DEV,Groundwater Sustain.

Here we conducted an assessment by global land model simulations following the design of the fifth Coupled Model Intercomparison Project (CMIP5) decadal hindcast experiments, specifically testing for the sensitivity to perfect initial or boundary conditions. The memory for terrestrial water storage (TWS) is longer than 6 years over 11% of global land areas where the deep soil moisture and aquifer water have a long memory and a nonnegligible variability. Ensemble decadal predictions based on realistic initial conditions are skillful over 31%, 43%, and 59% of global land areas for TWS, deep soil moisture, and aquifer water, respectively. The fraction of skillful predictions for TWS increases by 10%-16% when conditioned on Pacific Decadal Oscillation and Atlantic Multidecadal Oscillation indices. This study provides a first look at decadal hydrological predictability, with an improved skill when incorporating low-frequency climate information. Plain Language Summary Decadal prediction, which was initially proposed to more accurately project near-term (e.g., 10-30 years) climate change by using the experiences in weather and seasonal climate forecasting, has raised a wide concern since the IPCC CMIP5 project. The climate community is now trying to transition the decadal prediction from a pure research to a quasi-real-time operational effort. However, very limited information is known about the decadal hydrological predictability over land, which is more relevant to the livelihood and stakeholders. Here we combine an ensemble simulation method that is widely used to assess seasonal hydrological predictability, with the experimental design of the CMIP5 decadal climate hindcasts, to provide a first look at decadal hydrological predictability and skill by carrying out over 2,000 years global land model simulations. We found skillful decadal prediction for terrestrial water storage over one third land areas where deep soil moisture and aquifer have a nonnegligible variability. And the skill can be further enhanced by incorporating low-frequency teleconnection information from Atlantic and Pacific Oceans. This study suggests that it is possible to provide water resources managers useful hydrological forecast information over arid and semiarid regions a few years or even a decade in advance.","[Yuan, Xing; Zhu, Enda] Chinese Acad Sci, Inst Atmospher Phys, Key Lab Reg Climate Environm Temperate East Asia, Beijing, Peoples R China; [Zhu, Enda] Univ Chinese Acad Sci, Coll Earth Sci, Beijing, Peoples R China",,"Yuan, X (corresponding author), Chinese Acad Sci, Inst Atmospher Phys, Key Lab Reg Climate Environm Temperate East Asia, Beijing, Peoples R China.",yuanxing@tea.ac.cn,"Yuan, Xing/G-8392-2011","Yuan, Xing/0000-0001-6983-7368; zhu, enda/0000-0001-7757-9549",National Key R&D Program of China [2016YFA0600403]; National Natural Science Foundation of ChinaNational Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC) [91547103]; CAS Key Research Program of Frontier Sciences [QYZDY-SSW-DQC012],"The authors thank the Editor M.

As multiyear temperature predictions become more mainstream and skillful, guidance is needed to assist practitioners who wish to explore this maturing field. This paper demonstrates the process and considerations of incorporating multiyear temperature predictions into water resources planning. Multiyear temperature predictions from the Community Earth System Model Decadal Prediction Large Ensemble are presented as discrete and probabilistic products and are used to force two common hydrologic modeling approaches: conceptual and empirical. The approaches are demonstrated to simulate streamflow in the upper Colorado River basin watershed in Colorado, where diagnostics show that increasing temperatures are associated with decreasing streamflows. Using temperature information for lead years 2-6, two analyses are performed: (i) a retrospective hindcast for the climatological period (1981-2010) and (ii) a blind forecast for 2011-15. For the retrospective hindcast, including temperature information improved the percent error as compared with climatology. For the blind forecast, the multiyear temperature prediction for warming was skillful, but the corresponding multiyear average streamflow predictions from both approaches were counterintuitive: with the predicted warming, the multiyear average streamflow was predicted to be lower than the climatological mean; however, the observed multiyear average streamflow was higher than the climatological mean. This was due to above-average precipitation during the prediction time frame, particularly for one of the years. With that year removed, the multiyear streamflow average became lower than the climatological mean. Temperature provides a marginal source of streamflow predictability, but there will be substantial uncertainty until prediction skill for year-to-year climate variability, especially for precipitation, increases.","[Towler, Erin; Yates, David] Natl Ctr Atmospher Res, POB 3000, Boulder, CO 80307 USA",,"Towler, E (corresponding author), Natl Ctr Atmospher Res, POB 3000, Boulder, CO 80307 USA.",towler@ucar.edu,,,"National Center for Atmospheric Research (NCAR)National Science Foundation (NSF)NSF - Directorate for Geosciences (GEO); National Science Foundation (NSF)National Science Foundation (NSF) [1852977]; OAR Climate Program Office (CPO) [NA16OAR4310135]; NSF, Understanding Decision-Climate Interactions on Decadal Scales (UDECIDE) project [AGS-1419563]",This material is based upon work supported by the National Center for Atmospheric Research (NCAR); NCAR is a major facility sponsored by the National Science Foundation (NSF) under Cooperative Agreement 1852977.

Little is known about resistance to drying stress and the underpinning traits in Neotropical freshwater species, so we don't know whether desiccation resistance allows to anticipate shifts in biological diversity under future climate scenarios. Here, we used the aquatic invertebrates that live in the rainwater-filled leaves of tank bromeliads, to examine the extent to which desiccation resistance of species measured in the laboratory predicts community response to drought intensification in nature. We measured desiccation resistance in 17 invertebrate species (> 90% of the biomass usually found in bromeliads of French Guiana) by recording the median lethal time (LT50) of experimental populations exposed to controlled conditions of residual moisture. In the field, we placed rainshelters above tank bromeliads to emulate drought scenarios ranging from the ambient norm to IPCC scenarios and extreme events, and we recorded the response of functional community structure. LT50 ranged from 4.18 to 19.06 days, and was related to cuticle content and dry body mass. Among other functional indicators that represent strategies to optimize resource use under stressful conditions (e.g., habitat use, trophic specialization), LT50 was the best predictor of community structure responses along a gradient of emulated drought intensities. Therefore, species' LT5Os measured under laboratory conditions can be used to forecast aquatic community response to drying stress in nature. Anticipating how species will cope with drought has never been more important for environmental managers to support climate change adaptation. We show that desiccation resistance in freshwater invertebrates is a key indicator of potential population size and local-global range shifts, and this could be especially true in the Neotropics where species have narrow physiological tolerances for climatic variation.","[Cereghino, Regis; Compin, Arthur; Jassey, Vincent; Leflaive, Josephine; Rota, Thibaut] Univ Toulouse, Lab Ecol Fonct & Environm, CNRS, F-30162 Toulouse, France; [Francoise, Lea] Lab Environm Petit Saut, Hydreco Guyane, F-97388 Kourou, France; [Francoise, Lea; Leroy, Celine] Univ Montpellier, INRA, CNRS, CIRAD,IRD,AMAP, F-34398 Montpellier, France; [Bonhomme, Camille; Farjalla, Vinicius] Univ Fed Rio de Janeiro UFRJ, Inst Biol, Dept Ecol, Rio De Janeiro, Brazil; [Carrias, Jean-Francois; Corbara, Bruno] Univ Clermont Auvergne, CNRS, LMGE, F-63000 Clermont Ferrand, France; [Leroy, Celine] Univ Antilles, Univ Guyane, INRA, ECOFOG,AgroParisTech,CIRAD,CNRS, Campus Agron, F-97379 Kourou, France",,"Cereghino, R (corresponding author), Univ Toulouse, Lab Ecol Fonct & Environm, CNRS, F-30162 Toulouse, France.",regis.cereghino@univ-tlse3.fr,"Carrias, Jean-François/AAT-2738-2021","Carrias, Jean-François/0000-0002-6201-1544; Cereghino, Regis/0000-0003-3981-3159","French Agence Nationale de la Recherche (ANR) through the Resilience projectFrench National Research Agency (ANR) [ANR-18-CE02-0015]; Investissement d'Avenir grant (Labex CEBA)French National Research Agency (ANR) [ANR-10-LABX-25-01]; French Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique (CNRS) through the EC2CO-Biohefect project Proseco; French Fondation pour la Recherche sur la Biodiversite (FRB, CESAB programme)","We acknowledge financial support for research provided by the French Agence Nationale de la Recherche (ANR) through the Resilience project (grant ANR-18-CE02-0015) and an Investissement d'Avenir grant (Labex CEBA, ref.

Difficulty in linking data, analysis tools, and models is one of the barriers to be overcome in developing an integrated flood forecasting system. The current revolution in technology and the online availability of spatial data facilitate Canadians' need for information sharing in support of decision making. This need has resulted in studies demonstrating the suitability of the web as a medium for implementation of flood forecasting. Web-based Spatial Decision Support Services (WSDSS) provides comprehensive support for information retrieval, model analysis and extensive visualization functions for decision-making support and information services. This chapter develops a prototype WSDSS that integrates models, analytical tools, databases, graphical user interfaces, and spatial decision support services to help the public and decision makers to easily access flood and flood-threatened information. Flood WSDSS helps to mitigate flood disasters through river runoff prediction, flood forecasting, and flood information (flood discharge, water level and flood frequency) dissemination. The ultimate aim of this system is to improve access to flood model results by the public and decision makers.","[Wang, Lei] Chinese Acad Sci, Inst Remote Sensing & Digital Earth, Beijing 100101, Peoples R China; [Wang, Lei] Sanya Inst Remote Sensing, Hainan Prov Key Lab Earth Observat, Sanya 572029, Hainan Province, Peoples R China; [Zhang, Xin] Chinese Acad Sci, State Key Lab Remote Sensing Sci, Inst Remote Sensing & Digital Earth, Beijing 100101, Peoples R China",,"Wang, L (corresponding author), Chinese Acad Sci, Inst Remote Sensing & Digital Earth, Beijing 100101, Peoples R China.; Wang, L (corresponding author), Sanya Inst Remote Sensing, Hainan Prov Key Lab Earth Observat, Sanya 572029, Hainan Province, Peoples R China.",wanglei98@radi.ac.cn; zhangxin@radi.ac.cn,,,,,,4,0,0,1,1,SPRINGER-VERLAG BERLIN,BERLIN,"HEIDELBERGER PLATZ 3, D-14197 BERLIN, GERMANY",2211-0577,,978-3-319-42710-2; 978-3-319-42708-9,COAST RES LIBR,,,2017,18,,,,,,113,126,,10.1007/978-3-319-42710-2_6,10.1007/978-3-319-42710-2,,14,Geography; Remote Sensing,Book Citation Index – Social Sciences & Humanities (BKCI-SSH); Book Citation Index – Science (BKCI-S),Geography; Remote Sensing,BH2LY,WOS:000399043100007,,,,,2022-02-17

To evaluate the application of this WoF concept for probabilistic short-term flash flood prediction, the 0-3-h rainfall forecasts from NOAA National Severe Storms Laboratory's (NSSL) experimental WoF System (WoFS) were integrated as the forcing to the NWS operational hydrologic modeling core within the Flooded Locations and Simulated Hydrographs (FLASH) system. Initial assessment of the potential impacts of probabilistic short-term flash flood forecasts from this coupled atmosphere-hydrology (WoFS-FLASH) modeling system were evaluated in the 2018 Hydrometeorology Testbed Multi-Radar Multi-Sensor Hydrology experiment held in Norman, Oklahoma. During the 3-week experiment period, a total of nine NWS forecasters analyzed three retrospective flash flood events in archive mode. This study will describe specifically what information participants extracted from the WoFS-FLASH products during these three archived events, and how this type of information is expected to impact operational decision-making processes. Overall feedback from the testbed participants' evaluations show promise for the coupled NSSL WoFS-FLASH system probabilistic flash flood model guidance to enable earlier assessment and detection of flash flood threats and to advance the current warning lead time for these events.","[Yussouf, Nusrat; Wilson, Katie A.; Martinaitis, Steven M.; Vergara, Humberto] Univ Oklahoma, Cooperat Inst Mesoscale Meteorol Studies, Norman, OK 73019 USA; [Yussouf, Nusrat; Heinselman, Pam L.; Gourley, Jonathan J.] Univ Oklahoma, Sch Meteorol, Norman, OK 73019 USA; [Yussouf, Nusrat; Wilson, Katie A.; Martinaitis, Steven M.; Vergara, Humberto] NOAA, OAR, Natl Severe Storms Lab, Norman, OK 73026 USA; [Heinselman, Pam L.; Gourley, Jonathan J.] Univ Oklahoma, NOAA, OAR, Natl Severe Storms Lab, Norman, OK 73019 USA",,"Yussouf, N (corresponding author), Univ Oklahoma, Cooperat Inst Mesoscale Meteorol Studies, Norman, OK 73019 USA.; Yussouf, N (corresponding author), Univ Oklahoma, Sch Meteorol, Norman, OK 73019 USA.; Yussouf, N (corresponding author), NOAA, OAR, Natl Severe Storms Lab, Norman, OK 73026 USA.",nusrat.yussouf@noaa.gov,"Vergara, Humberto J/I-8089-2016","Vergara, Humberto J/0000-0003-0572-4545; Yussouf, Nusrat/0000-0003-4998-1770","Hydrometeorology Testbed by the Office of Weather and Air Quality under NOAA Award [NA17OAR4590281]; NOAA/Office of Oceanic and Atmospheric Research under NOAA-University of Oklahoma, U.S. Department of CommerceNational Oceanic Atmospheric Admin (NOAA) - USA [NA11OAR4320072]","The HMT-Hydro Experiment is funded through the Hydrometeorology Testbed by the Office of Weather and Air Quality under NOAA Award NA17OAR4590281.

In this study, the capability of a newly proposed hybrid forecasting model based on the firefly algorithm (FFA) as a metaheuristic optimizer, integrated with the multilayer perceptron (MLP-FFA), is investigated for the prediction of monthly water quality in Langat River basin, Malaysia. The predictive ability of the MLP-FFA model is assessed against the MLP-based model. To validate the proposed MLP-FFA model, monthly water quality data over a 10-year duration (2001-2010) for two different hydrological stations (1L04 and 1L05) provided by the Irrigation and Drainage Ministry of Malaysia are used to predict the biochemical oxygen demand (BOD) and dissolved oxygen (DO). The input variables are the chemical oxygen demand (COD), total phosphate (PO4), total solids, potassium (K), sodium (Na), chloride (Cl), electrical conductivity (EC), pH and ammonia nitrogen (NH4-N). The proposed hybrid model is then evaluated in accordance with statistical metrics such as the correlation coefficient (r), root-mean-square error, % root-mean-square error and Willmott's index of agreement. Analysis of the results shows that MLP-FFA outperforms the equivalent MLP model. Also, in this research, the uncertainty of a MLP neural network model is analyzed in relation to the predictive ability of the MLP model. To assess the uncertainties within the MLP model, the percentage of observed data bracketed by 95 percent predicted uncertainties (95PPU) and the band width of 95 percent confidence intervals (d-factors) are selected. The effect of input variables on BOD and DO prediction is also investigated through sensitivity analysis. The obtained values bracketed by 95PPU show about 77.7%, 72.2% of data for BOD and 72.2%, 91.6% of data for DO related to the 1L04 and 1L05 stations, respectively. The d-factors have a value of 1.648, 2.269 for BOD and 1.892, 3.480 for DO related to the 1L04 and 1L05 stations, respectively. Based on the values in both stations for the 95PPU and d-factor, it is concluded that the neural network model has an acceptably low degree of uncertainty applied for BOD and DO simulations. The findings of this study can have important implications for error assessment in artificial intelligence-based predictive models applied for water resources management and the assessment of the overall health in major river systems.","[Raheli, Bahare; Aalami, Mohammad Taghi] Univ Tabriz, Dept Civil Engn, Tabriz, Iran; [El-Shafie, Ahmed] Univ Malaya, Dept Civil Engn, Fac Engn, Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia; [Ghorbani, Mohammad Ali] Univ Tabriz, Dept Water Engn, Tabriz, Iran; [Ghorbani, Mohammad Ali] Near East Univ, Fac Engn, Mersin 10, TR-99138 Nicosia, North Cyprus, Turkey; [Deo, Ravinesh C.] Univ Southern Queensland, Inst Agr & Environm, Sch Agr Computat & Environm Sci, Springfield, Qld 4300, Australia",,"Raheli, B (corresponding author), Univ Tabriz, Dept Civil Engn, Tabriz, Iran.",b.raheli93@ms.tabrizu.ac.ir,"Ghorbani, Mohammad Ali/N-5442-2019; Ghorbani, Mohammad Ali/N-5420-2019; Deo, Ravinesh/F-6157-2012; El-Shafie, Ahmed/J-1799-2014","Ghorbani, Mohammad Ali/0000-0002-0333-2559; Deo, Ravinesh/0000-0002-2290-6749; El-Shafie, Ahmed/0000-0001-5018-8505",,,,69,54,55,1,35,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"ONE NEW YORK PLAZA, SUITE 4600, NEW YORK, NY, UNITED STATES",1866-6280,1866-6299,,ENVIRON EARTH SCI,Environ.

Dams and reservoirs are thought to promote freshwater fish invasion success through hydrological alterations but the evidence for their role in the global invasion of Largemouth Bass (Micropterus salmoides) on a landscape scale is limited. Here, we examine the distribution of Largemouth Bass, one of the most widely introduced fish in the world, from the Iberian Peninsula using species distribution models (SDMs), including an ensemble forecast. We used these models to test the role of twelve environmental predictors expected to influence the distribution of Largemouth Bass, including the reservoir storage capacity at local and upstream reaches. We found that the predictive accuracy, based on AUC criteria, of the ensemble model was higher than any of the six individual SDMs for Largemouth Bass. The most influential predictor of bass distribution included in our model of the Iberian Peninsula was temperature, where warmer temperatures were generally associated with bass presence, and cooler temperatures with absence. In addition to warmer temperatures, increasing storage of local and upstream reservoirs increased predicted presence, suggesting an important role of reservoirs in mediating the invasive success of this fish. Our results indicate that although natural climatic factors may be crucial in the successful invasion of Largemouth Bass, hydrological alteration (e.g., regulated flow regimes and lentic habitats associated with dams and reservoirs) may be important. Understanding the drivers promoting the establishment of this global invader will be important in identifying areas at risk and in developing future efforts to control its spread, especially when those drivers are ongoing anthropogenic disturbances such as the construction and operation of dams and reservoirs.

Under the CORDEX-EA project, the precipitation and temperature projections (2020-2045) for the economically and socially important region of Northwestern China were derived from high-resolution regional climate model (RCM) simulations for RCP 4.5 and 8.5 scenarios, and compared against a historical period or baseline of 1980-2005. Drawing data from four key RCMs [Weather Research and Forecasting (WRF); Regional Spectral Model (RSM); Regional Climate Model version 4.0 (RegCM4); Mesoscale Model version 5 (MM5)], reliable local-scale projections were generated by applying suitable bias correction that accords with the multivariate bias correction (MBC) approach. To validate this approach and then evaluate climate change impacts, the adjusted precipitation and temperature estimated from bias-corrected models for the historical period were compared to the observed data. The results showed that the simulated spatiotemporal distribution of multiyear average precipitation and temperature appear to fit relatively well with the observations, however, the wet-cold and dry-warm climate-related biases were still evident for the high altitude regions. Bias-corrected future projections of RCMs indicated spatially averaged annual precipitation is expected to rise by about 23.6 and 35.3 mm under the RCP 4.5 and 8.5 scenarios, respectively, while spatially averaged annual temperature is expected to rise by about 1.95 and 1.10 degrees C. Precipitation is projected to increase in all seasons, albeit, more so in the cold season (i.e., boreal winter and spring) than the warm season (i.e., boreal summer and autumn). The annual increase is expected to be about 56.7% under the RCP 4.5 scenario, compared to 67.6% under the RCP 8.5 scenario. The changes of mean temperature in winter are expected to be significant, -37.8% under both RCP scenarios. For spring, the mean temperature will rise by 23.1% (28.9%) under the RCP 4.5 (8.5) scenario. A MBC approach was found to be effective in yielding reliable projected changes in precipitation and temperature variables. The proposed approach has important implications for climatological studies and evaluation of climate change impacts on localized regions, not only in China, but also in other similar areas of the world, where decisions for managing climate risk must be implemented by policy makers, government, industry and stakeholders.","[Yin, Zhenliang; Feng, Qi; Yang, Linshan; Deo, Ravinesh C.; Wen, Xiaohu; Jia, Bing; Si, Jianhua] Chinese Acad Sci, Northwest Inst Ecoenvironm & Resources, Key Lab Ecohydrol Inland River Basin, Lanzhou 730000, Gansu, Peoples R China; [Deo, Ravinesh C.] Univ Southern Queensland, Sch Sci, Ctr Sustainable Agr Syst, Springfield, Qld, Australia; [Deo, Ravinesh C.] Univ Southern Queensland, Ctr Appl Climate Sci, Springfield, Qld, Australia; [Adamowski, Jan F.] McGill Univ, Dept Bioresource Engn, Fac Agr & Environm Sci, Montreal, PQ, Canada",,"Feng, Q; Deo, RC (corresponding author), Chinese Acad Sci, Northwest Inst Ecoenvironm & Resources, Key Lab Ecohydrol Inland River Basin, Lanzhou 730000, Gansu, Peoples R China.",qifeng@lzb.ac.cn; ravinesh.deo@usq.edu.au,"Wen, Xiaohu/AAE-3378-2021; Deo, Ravinesh/F-6157-2012","Deo, Ravinesh/0000-0002-2290-6749; Yang, Linshan/0000-0002-6862-4106","Chinese Academy of SciencesChinese Academy of Sciences [USQ943692018]; National Key R&D Program of China [2017YFC0404302, 2016YFC0400908]; National Natural Science Foundation of ChinaNational Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC) [41601038]; Major Program of the Natural Science Foundation of Gansu [18JR4RA002]; Key Research Program of Frontier Sciences, CAS [QYZDJ-SSW-DQC031]","Chinese Academy of Sciences, Grant/Award Number: USQ943692018; National Key R&D Program of China, Grant/Award Numbers: 2017YFC0404302, 2016YFC0400908; National Natural Science Foundation of China, Grant/Award Number: 41601038; Major Program of the Natural Science Foundation of Gansu, Grant/Award Number: 18JR4RA002; Key Research Program of Frontier Sciences, CAS, Grant/Award Number: QYZDJ-SSW-DQC031",,109,7,9,4,30,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0899-8418,1097-0088,,INT J CLIMATOL,Int.

Publicly available weather forecasts sufficiently resolve weather patterns above large lakes to satisfactorily force a lake hydrodynamics model, we suspect this is not the case for smaller lakes. We address this issue using weather outputs from a numerical weather prediction model at three different resolutions (3 km, 1 and 0.33 km) to force a hydrodynamics model of Lake George, NY for the month of June 2017. We find that increasing the resolution of the weather model improves the accuracy of the simulation, in part through a significant increase in total heat content of the lake. This warming is linked to an increase in downward heat transfer from the atmosphere in the higher resolution experiment, especially in the northern part of the lake where the lake is less than 2 km wide and the simulated surface winds are stronger. Interrogation of the weather model shows the stronger winds originate from a better representation of the land-lake interface (and thereby surface roughness length) at higher resolution. At the end of the one month simulation, we find the hypolimnetic volume of Lake George has reduced by 15% in the 0.33 km experiment compared to the 3 km experiment. If this discrepancy were systemic it would have obvious consequences for predicting the ecoysystem function over an extended period of small-to-medium sized lakes.","[Auger, Guillaume A.

Statistical models that use streamflow and mechanistic models that use meteorological information and land-use are commonly employed to develop continuous streamflow and nutrient records. Given the availability of long meteorological records, mechanistic models have the potential to develop continuous water quality records, but such predictions suffer from systematic biases on both streamflow and water quality constituents. This study proposes a multivariate bias correction technique based on canonical correlation analysis (CCA) - a dimension reduction technique based on multivariate multiple regression - that reduces the bias in both streamflow and loadings simultaneously by preserving the cross-correlation. We compare the performance of CCA with linear regression (LR) in removing the systematic bias from the SWAT model forced with precipitation and temperature for three selected watersheds from the Southeastern US. First, we compare the performance of CCA with LR in removing the bias in SWAT model outputs in predicting the observed streamflow and total nitrogen (TN) loadings from the Water Quality Network (WQN) dataset. We also evaluate the potential of CCA in removing the bias in SWAT model predictions at daily and monthly time scales by considering the LOADEST model predicted loadings as the predictand for CCA and LR. Evaluation of CCA with the observed dataset and at daily and streamflow time scales shows that the proposed multivariate technique not only reduces the bias in the cross-correlation between streamflow and loadings, but also improves the joint probability of estimating observed streamflow and loadings. Potential implications of the proposed bias-correction technique, CCA, in water quality forecasting and management are also discussed.","[Libera, Dominic A.; Sankarasubramanian, A.] North Carolina State Univ, Dept Civil Construct & Environm Engn, Raleigh, NC 27695 USA",,"Libera, DA (corresponding author), North Carolina State Univ, Dept Civil Construct & Environm Engn, Raleigh, NC 27695 USA.",dalibera@ncsu.edu,"; Arumugam, Sankarasubramanian/A-1929-2019","Libera, Dominic/0000-0002-9774-6065; Arumugam, Sankarasubramanian/0000-0002-7668-1311",National Science FoundationNational Science Foundation (NSF) [0954405],We would like to thank the National Science Foundation for supporting this project under the CARRER Grant Climate Informed Uncertainty Analyses for Integrated Water Resources Sustainability No. 0954405.,,54,10,10,1,26,ELSEVIER SCIENCE BV,AMSTERDAM,"PO BOX 211, 1000 AE AMSTERDAM, NETHERLANDS",0022-1694,1879-2707,,J HYDROL,J.

Additionally, the forecasting accuracy and uncertainty estimation are the meaningful assignments that need to be recognized. The addressed research investigates the potential of novel ensemble approach, Bayesian model averaging (BMA), in streamflow forecasting using daily time series data from two stations (i.e., Hongcheon and Jucheon), South Korea. Six categories (i.e., M1-M6) of input combination using different antecedent times were employed for streamflow forecasting. The outcomes of BMA model were compared with those of multivariate adaptive regression spline (MARS), M5 model tree (M5Tree), and Kernel extreme learning machines (KELM) models considering four assessment indexes, root mean square error (RMSE), Nash-Sutcliffe efficiency (NSE), correlation coefficient (R), and mean absolute error (MAE). The results revealed the superior accuracy of BMA model over three machine learning models in daily streamflow forecasting. Considering RMSE values among the best models during testing phase, the best BMA model (i.e., BMA2) enhanced the forecasting accuracy of MARS1, M5Tree4, and KELM3 models by 5.2%, 5.8%, and 3.4% in Hongcheon station. Additionally, the best BMA model (i.e., BMA1) improved the forecasting accuracy of MARS1, M5Tree1, and KELM1 models by 6.7%, 9.5%, and 3.7% in Jucheon station. In addition, the best BMA models in both stations allowed the uncertainty estimation, and produced higher uncertainty of peak flows compared to that of low flows. As one of the most robust and effective tools, therefore, the BMA model can be successfully employed for streamflow forecasting with different antecedent times.","[Kim, Sungwon] Dongyang Univ, Dept Railrd Construct & Safety Engn, Yeongju 36040, South Korea; [Alizamir, Meysam] Islamic Azad Univ, Hamedan Branch, Dept Civil Engn, Hamadan 6518115743, Hamadan, Iran; [Kim, Nam Won] Korea Inst Civil Engn & Bldg Technol, Dept Land Water & Environm Res, Goyang Si 10223, South Korea; [Kisi, Ozgur] Ilia State Univ, Sch Technol, Dept Civil Engn, GE-0162 Tbilisi, Georgia; [Kisi, Ozgur] Duy Tan Univ, Inst Res & Dev, Da Nang 550000, Vietnam",,"Kim, S (corresponding author), Dongyang Univ, Dept Railrd Construct & Safety Engn, Yeongju 36040, South Korea.; Kim, NW (corresponding author), Korea Inst Civil Engn & Bldg Technol, Dept Land Water & Environm Res, Goyang Si 10223, South Korea.",swkim1968@dyu.ac.kr; meysamalizamir@gmail.com; nwkim@kict.re.kr; ozgur.kisi@iliauni.edu.ge,"Alizamir, Meysam/AAK-6312-2021","Kisi, Ozgur/0000-0001-7847-5872; Kim, Sungwon/0000-0002-9371-8884",Korea Institute of Civil Engineering and Building Technology [20200027-001],"This research was funded by the Korea Institute of Civil Engineering and Building Technology, grant number 20200027-001.",,68,6,6,4,8,MDPI,BASEL,"ST ALBAN-ANLAGE 66, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND",,2071-1050,,SUSTAINABILITY-BASEL,Sustainability,NOV,2020,12,22,,,,,,,9720,10.3390/su12229720,,,22,Green & Sustainable Science & Technology; Environmental Sciences; Environmental Studies,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Science & Technology - Other Topics; Environmental Sciences & Ecology,OZ0DJ,WOS:000594606700001,,gold,,,2022-02-17

Time series and trend analyses were performed using monthly streamflow data for the period between 1999 and 2014. Pettitt's change point analysis was employed to detect the time of change for historical streamflow time series. Kendall's tau and Spearman's rho tests were also conducted. The results of the change point analysis determined the change point as 2008. The time series analysis showed that the streamflow of the river had a decreasing trend from the past to the present. Results of the trend analysis forecasted a decreasing trend for the streamflow in the future. The decreasing trend in the streamflow may be related to climate change.

In this study, we use a machine learning model to assess the predictability of column minimum dissolved oxygen in Chesapeake Bay at a monthly time scale. Compared to previous models for dissolved oxygen and hypoxia, our model has the advantages of resolving spatial variability and fitting more flexible relationships between dissolved oxygen and the predictor variables. Using a concise set of predictors with established relationships with dissolved oxygen, we find that dissolved oxygen in a given month can be skillfully predicted with knowledge of stratification and mean temperature during the same month. Furthermore, the predictions generated by the model are consistent with expectations from prior knowledge and basic physics. The model reveals that accurate knowledge or skillful forecasts of the vertical density gradient is the key to successful prediction of dissolved oxygen, and prediction skill disappears if stratification is only known at the beginning of the forecast. The lost skill cannot be recovered by replacing stratification as a predictor with variables that have a lagged correlation with stratification (such as river discharge); however, skill is obtainable in many cases if stratification can be forecast with an error of less than about 1 kg m(-3). Thus, future research on hypoxia forecasting should focus on understanding and forecasting variations in stratification over subseasonal time scales (between about two weeks and two months).","[Ross, Andrew C.] Princeton Univ, Program Atmospher & Ocean Sci, 300 Forrestal Rd,Sayre Hall, Princeton, NJ 08540 USA; [Ross, Andrew C.; Stock, Charles A.] Princeton Univ, NOAA, Geophys Fluid Dynam Lab, Forrestal Campus,201 Forrestal Rd, Princeton, NJ 08540 USA",,"Ross, AC (corresponding author), Princeton Univ, Program Atmospher & Ocean Sci, 300 Forrestal Rd,Sayre Hall, Princeton, NJ 08540 USA.",andrew.c.ross@noaa.gov; charles.stock@noaa.gov,,"Ross, Andrew/0000-0003-1770-893X","National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, U.S. Department of CommerceNational Oceanic Atmospheric Admin (NOAA) - USA [NA14OAR4320106]; NOAA Integrated Ecosystem Assessment program","The authors thank Barbara Muhling for providing useful information about the model tree method and Xiao Liu and Fernando Gonzlez Taboada for providing helpful reviews of this manuscript.

In recent years, the increment of temperature due to excessive increased emission of greenhouse gases has led to an abnormality in the climate system of the earth. The main objective of this study is to survey the future climate changes in one of the biggest mountainous watersheds in northeast of Iran (i.e., Kashafrood). In this research, by considering the precipitation and temperature as two important climatic parameters in watersheds, 14 models evolved in the general circulation models (GCMs) of the newest generation in the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project Phase 5 (CMIP5) were used to forecast the future climate changes in the study area. For the historical period of 1992-2005, four evaluation criteria including Nash-Sutcliffe (NS), percent of bias (PBIAS), coefficient of determination (R (2)) and the ratio of the root-mean-square-error to the standard deviation of measured data (RSR) were used to compare the simulated observed data for assessing goodness-of-fit of the models. In the primary results, four climate models namely GFDL-ESM2G, IPSL-CM5A-MR, MIROC-ESM, and NorESM1-M were selected among the abovementioned 14 models due to their more prediction accuracies to the investigated evaluation criteria. Thereafter, climate changes of the future periods (near-century, 2006-2037; mid-century, 2037-2070; and late-century, 2070-2100) were investigated and compared by four representative concentration pathways (RCPs) of new emission scenarios of RCP2.6, RCP4.5, RCP6.0, and RCP8.5. In order to assess the trend of annual and seasonal changes of climatic components, Mann-Kendall non-parametric test (MK) was also employed. The results of Mann-Kendall test revealed that the precipitation has significant variable trends of both positive and negative alterations. Furthermore, the mean, maximum, and minimum temperature values had significant positive trends at 90, 99, and 99.9 % confidence level. On the other hand, in all parts of the Kashafrood Watershed (KW), the average temperature of watershed will be increased up to 0.56-3.3 A degrees C and the mean precipitation will be decreased up to 10.7 % by the end of the twenty-first century comparing to the historical baselines. Also, in seasonal scale, the maximum and minimum precipitations will occur in spring and summer, respectively, and the mean temperature is higher than the historical baseline in all seasons. The maximum and minimum values of the mean temperature will occur in summer and winter, respectively, and the amount of seasonal precipitation in these seasons will be reduced.","[Afshar, A.

The potential for TWS from GRACE (Gravity Recovery and Climate Experiment) satellites to provide long-lead streamflow forecasting in adjacent lowlands during the low-flow season was assessed using the upper Yellow River as a case study. Two linear models were trained for forecasting monthly streamflow with and without TWS anomaly (TWSA) from 2002 to 2016. Results show that the model based on streamflow and TWSA is superior to the model based on streamflow alone at up to a five-month lead-time. The inclusion of TWSA reduced errors in streamflow forecasts by 25% to 50%, with 3-5-month lead-times, which represents the role of terrestrial hydrologic memory in streamflow changes during the low-flow season. This study underscores the high potential of streamflow forecasting using GRACE data with long lead-times that should improve water management in mountainous water towers and downstream areas.","[Liu, Xingcai; Tang, Qiuhong; Hosseini-Moghari, Seyed-Mohammad] Chinese Acad Sci, Inst Geog Sci & Nat Resources Res, Key Lab Water Cycle & Related Land Surface Proc, Beijing 100101, Peoples R China; [Tang, Qiuhong] Univ Chinese Acad Sci, Beijing 100049, Peoples R China; [Shi, Xiaogang] Univ Glasgow, Sch Interdisciplinary Studies, Dumfries DG1 4ZL, Scotland; [Lo, Min-Hui] Natl Taiwan Univ, Dept Atmospher Sci, Taipei 10617, Taiwan; [Scanlon, Bridget] Univ Texas Austin, Bur Econ Geol, Jackson Sch Geosci, Austin, TX 78712 USA",,"Tang, QH (corresponding author), Chinese Acad Sci, Inst Geog Sci & Nat Resources Res, Key Lab Water Cycle & Related Land Surface Proc, Beijing 100101, Peoples R China.; Tang, QH (corresponding author), Univ Chinese Acad Sci, Beijing 100049, Peoples R China.",xingcailiu@igsnrr.ac.cn; tangqh@igsnrr.ac.cn; sm@igsnrr.ac.cn; John.Shi@glasgow.ac.uk; minhuilo@ntu.edu.tw; bridget.scanlon@beg.utexas.edu,"Tang, Qiuhong/AAD-9832-2022; Liu, Xingcai/R-3510-2018; Tang, Qiuhong/ABA-2194-2021; Scanlon, Bridget/A-3105-2009","Liu, Xingcai/0000-0001-5726-7353; Tang, Qiuhong/0000-0002-0886-6699; Scanlon, Bridget/0000-0002-1234-4199; Hosseini-Moghari, Seyed-Mohammad/0000-0001-6766-5283","Strategic Priority Research Program of Chinese Academy of SciencesChinese Academy of Sciences [XDA20060402]; National Natural Science Foundation of ChinaNational Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC) [41877164, 41730645, 41790424]","This study was supported by the Strategic Priority Research Program of Chinese Academy of Sciences (XDA20060402), the National Natural Science Foundation of China (No. 41877164, 41730645, 41790424).",,44,0,0,7,8,MDPI,BASEL,"ST ALBAN-ANLAGE 66, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND",,2072-4292,,REMOTE SENS-BASEL,Remote Sens.,MAY,2021,13,10,,,,,,,1993,10.3390/rs13101993,,,12,"Environmental Sciences; Geosciences, Multidisciplinary; Remote Sensing; Imaging Science & Photographic Technology",Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),Environmental Sciences & Ecology; Geology; Remote Sensing; Imaging Science & Photographic Technology,ST7VM,WOS:000662647400001,,"gold, Green Accepted",,,2022-02-17

Climate mode indices, utilising machine learning methods, are frequently considered as predictor variables in order to forecast several different hydrological variables. In this study, a feature selection algorithm based on two different deep learning models, i.e., long short-term memory and a gated recurrent unit, is applied to improve the forecasting capability of streamflow water levels at six gauging stations in the Murray Darling Basin of Australia. This paper therefore aggregates the significant antecedent lag memory of climate mode indices, rainfall, and the monthly factor based on the periodicity as the predictor variables to attain significantly accurate stream water level forecasts. This novel method identifies an improved relationship between the stream water level and climate mode indices through the aggregation of the significant lagged datasets capturing the historical features to predict the future streamflow water level. The boruta feature selection algorithm (BRF) was then applied in a two phase process before and after attaining the significant lagged inputs to screen the optimum predictor variables. The merits of the forecast models were evaluated through different performance evaluation criteria. The results show that the accumulated significant lagged inputs based on climate mode indices, along with the rainfall and periodicity factors are seen to provide improved forecasting of the SWL over the non-BRF deep learning approaches where no prior feature selection was applied. The hybrid LSTM method (i.e., BRF-LSTM model) achieved a unique advantage in terms of SWL forecasting, particularly attaining over 98% of the predictive errors lying within a band of +/-0.015 m with relatively low relative errors (RRMSE approximate to 1.30% and RMAE approximate to 0.882%), outperforming all of the benchmark models. It is also found that the periodicity factor has a potential influence on the accuracy of the forecast models for the four monitored study stations. This study concludes that the newly developed hybrid deep learning approaches, coupled with the BRF feature selection, provide improved forecasting performance. The hybrid approach developed in this paper can therefore be used to provide a strong provide predictive response algorithm for the hydrological variables that were influenced by the low-frequency variability of the climate model indices in respect to streamflow water level.","[Ahmed, A.

For this purpose, four future water supply projections are generated using a hydroclimate modeling framework. This framework includes the coupling of a regional climate model, the weather research and forecasting (WRF) model, and a fully physically-based hydrologic model, the watershed environmental hydrology (WEHY) model, under two IPCC representative concentration pathway scenarios (RCP4.5 and RCP8.5) of a CMIP5 global climate model, HadGEM2-ES. A dynamic water balance model is, then, developed to carry out reservoir simulations and is used to operate the reservoir with the projected future flowrates in order to identify water deficits or surpluses under the projected irrigation water demands for the years between 2015 and 2100.","[Gorguner, Merve; Kavvas, M.

To investigate this, a 26-year streamflow record was simulated for 33 basins (54-928 km(2)) in the Delaware River Basin using three dates of land cover: the 2011 National Land-Cover Dataset (Homer, Fry, & Barnes, ), 2030 land-cover conditions representing median values from 101 equally-likely forecasts, and 2060 land-cover conditions corresponding to the same iterations used to represent 2030. Streamflow was simulated using a process-based hydrologic model that includes both pervious and impervious methods as parameterized by three land-cover-based hydrologic response units (HRUs)-forested, agricultural, and developed land. Small, but significant differences in streamflow magnitude, variability, and seasonality were seen among the three time periods-2011, 2030, and 2060. Temporal differences were discernible from the range of conditions simulated with 101 equally likely forecasts for 2030. Development was co-located with the most frequent landscape components, as characterized by topographic wetness index, resulting in a change in hydrology for each HRU, highlighting that knowing the location of disturbance is key to understanding potential streamflow changes. These results show that streamflow simulation using regional calibration that incorporates land-cover-based HRUs can be sensitive to relatively small changes in land-cover and that temporal trends resulting from land-cover change can be isolated in order to evaluate other changes that might affect water resources.","[Williamson, Tanja N.] US Geol Survey, Ohio Kentucky Indiana Water Sci Ctr, 9818 Bluegrass Pkwy, Louisville, KY 40299 USA; [Claggett, Peter] US Geol Survey, Chesapeake Bay Program Off, Annapolis, MD USA",,"Williamson, TN (corresponding author), US Geol Survey, Ohio Kentucky Indiana Water Sci Ctr, 9818 Bluegrass Pkwy, Louisville, KY 40299 USA.",tnwillia@usgs.gov,,"Williamson, Tanja/0000-0002-7639-8495",USGSUnited States Geological Survey,USGS,,53,3,3,2,9,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0885-6087,1099-1085,,HYDROL PROCESS,Hydrol.

As a result, it is necessary to establish effective and reliable methodologies for assessing water quality and predicting future trends. This work investigates regression and machine learning models such as linear regression, random forest, support vector machine (SVM) and long short-term memory (LSTM) to predict the salinity level of Salton Sea and forecast future trend. The proposed work studies the Salton Sea water quality and predict certain chemical or physical characteristics such as salinity, pH, and dissolved oxygen. It also finds the correlation between water indexes and environmental indexes surrounding the Salton Sea. The findings of this study can assist policymakers in determining the salinity of water and devising policies to minimise salt levels in order to manage freshwater for long-term development.

The bias correction adjustments have been applied on precipitation and temperature from the European Centre for Middle-range Weather Forecasting System 4 (S4). We have used three bias correction strategies: two linear (mean bias correction, BC, and linear regression, LR) and one non-linear (Model Output Statistics analogs, MOS-analog). The results have been compared with climatology and persistence. The volume-anomaly model is a previously computed Multiple Linear Regression that ingests precipitation, temperature and in-flow anomaly data to simulate monthly volume anomalies. The potential utility for end-users has been assessed using economic value curve areas. We have studied the S4 hindcast period 1981-2010 for each month of the year and up to seven months ahead considering an ensemble of 15 members. We have shown that the MOS-analog and LR bias corrections can improve the original S4. The application to volume anomalies points towards the possibility to introduce bias correction methods as a tool to improve water resource seasonal forecasts in an end-user context of climate services. Particularly, the MOS-analog approach gives generally better results than the other approaches in late autumn and early winter. (c) 2017 Elsevier B.V.

Among other requirements, effective early action systems necessitate the availability of high-quality forecasts to inform decision making. In this study, we evaluate the ability of statistical and physically based season-ahead prediction models to appropriately trigger flood early preparedness actions based on a 75% or greater probability of surpassing the 80th percentile of historical seasonal streamflow for the floodprone Maranon River and Piura River in Peru. The statistical prediction model, developed in this work, leverages the asymmetric relationship between seasonal streamflow and the ENSO phenomenon. Additionally, a multi-model (least-squares combination) is also evaluated against current operational practices. The statistical prediction demonstrates superior performance compared to the physically based model for the Maranon River by correctly triggering preparedness actions in three out of four historical occasions, while both the statistical and multi-model predictions capture all four historical events when the required threshold excee-dance probability is reduced to 50 %, with only one false alarm. For the Piura River, the statistical model proves superior to all other approaches, correctly triggering 28% more often in the hindcast period. Continued efforts should focus on applying this season-ahead prediction framework to additional flood-prone locations where early actions may be warranted and current forecast capacity is limited.","[Keating, Colin; Lee, Donghoon; Block, Paul] Univ Wisconsin, Dept Civil & Environm Engn, Madison, WI 53706 USA; [Keating, Colin] Univ Wisconsin, Nelson Inst Environm Studies, Madison, WI 53706 USA; [Lee, Donghoon] Univ Calif Santa Barbara, Dept Geog, Climate Hazards Ctr, Santa Barbara, CA 93106 USA; [Bazo, Juan] Red Cross Red Crescent Climate Ctr, NL-2521 CV The Hague, Netherlands; [Bazo, Juan] Univ Tecnol Peru UTP, Lima, Peru",,"Keating, C (corresponding author), Univ Wisconsin, Dept Civil & Environm Engn, Madison, WI 53706 USA.; Keating, C (corresponding author), Univ Wisconsin, Nelson Inst Environm Studies, Madison, WI 53706 USA.",ckeating2@wisc.edu,"Lee, Donghoon/O-3196-2015; Bazo, Juan/E-3690-2013","Lee, Donghoon/0000-0001-5438-903X; Bazo, Juan/0000-0001-9204-5908","Wisconsin Alumni Research Foundation; Office of the Vice Chancellor for Research and Graduate Education, University of Wisconsin-Madison","This research has been supported by the Wisconsin Alumni Research Foundation and the Office of the Vice Chancellor for Research and Graduate Education, University of Wisconsin-Madison.",,77,0,0,4,4,COPERNICUS GESELLSCHAFT MBH,GOTTINGEN,"BAHNHOFSALLEE 1E, GOTTINGEN, 37081, GERMANY",1561-8633,1684-9981,,NAT HAZARD EARTH SYS,Nat.

China's Baiyunshan Reservoir basin was selected as a case study, and the Xinanjiang model was used.

Recent years have witnessed the regular and massive development of some filamentous algae or cyanobacteria in Lake Geneva. Consequently, important blooms could result in detrimental impacts on economic issues and human health. In this study, we tried to lay the foundation of an HAB forecast model to help scientists and local stakeholders with the present and future management of this peri-alpine lake. Our forecast strategy was based on pairing two machine learning models with a long-term database built over the past 34 years. We created HAB groups via a K-means model. Then, we introduced different lag times in the input of a random forest (RF) model, using a sliding window. Finally, we used a high-frequency dataset to compare the natural mechanisms with numerical interaction using individual conditional expectation plots. We demonstrate that some HAB events can be forecasted over a year scale. The information contained in the concentration data of the cyanobacteria was synthesized in the form of four intensity groups that directly depend on the P. rubescens concentration. The categorical transformation of these data allowed us to obtain a forecast with correlation coefficients that stayed above a threshold of 0.5 until one year for the counting cells and two years for the biovolume data. Moreover, we found that the RF model predicted the best P. rubescens abundance for water temperatures around 14 degrees C. This result is consistent with the biological processes of the toxic cyano-bacterium.

In this paper, a framework coupling the original Climate Forecasting System (CFS) precipitation with the Soil and Water Assessment Tool (SWAT) was proposed to forecast the nine-month streamflow for the Cascade Reservoir System of Han River (CRSHR) including Shiquan, Ankang and Danjiangkou reservoirs. First, CFS precipitation was tested against the observation and post-processed through two machine learning algorithms, random forest and support vector regression. Results showed the correlation coefficients between the monthly areal CFS precipitation (post-processed) and observation were 0.91-0.96, confirming that CFS precipitation post-processing using machine learning was not affected by the extended forecast period. Additionally, two precipitation spatio-temporal distribution models, original CFS and similar historical observation, were adopted to disaggregate the processed monthly areal CFS precipitation to daily subbasin-scale precipitation. Based on the reservoir restoring flow, the regional SWAT was calibrated for CRSHR. The Nash-Sutcliffe efficiencies for three reservoirs flow simulation were 0.86, 0.88 and 0.84, respectively, meeting the accuracy requirement. The experimental forecast showed that for three reservoirs, long-term streamflow forecast with similar historical observed distribution was more accurate than that with original CFS.","[Liu, Tian; Chen, Yuanfang; Li, Binquan; Hu, Yiming; Liang, Zhongmin] Hohai Univ, Coll Hydrol & Water Resources, Nanjing 210098, Jiangsu, Peoples R China; [Chen, Yuanfang; Liang, Zhongmin] Hohai Univ, State Key Lab Hydrol Water Resources & Hydraul En, Nanjing 210098, Jiangsu, Peoples R China; [Qiu, Hui] Bur Hydrol, Changjiang Water Resources Commiss, Wuhan 430010, Hubei, Peoples R China",,"Liang, ZM (corresponding author), Hohai Univ, Coll Hydrol & Water Resources, Nanjing 210098, Jiangsu, Peoples R China.",zmliang@hhu.edu.cn,,,"National Key Research and Development Program of China [2016YFC0402706, 2016YFC0402707]; Fundamental Research Funds for the Central UniversitiesFundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities [2017B611X14]; National Natural Science Foundation of ChinaNational Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC) [41730750]; Postgraduate Research & Practice Innovation Program of Jiangsu Province [KYCX17_0415]","This paper was jointly supported by the National Key Research and Development Program of China (2016YFC0402706, 2016YFC0402707), the Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities (2017B611X14), the Key Program of National Natural Science Foundation of China (41730750), and Postgraduate Research & Practice Innovation Program of Jiangsu Province (KYCX17_0415).",,51,3,3,4,23,IWA PUBLISHING,LONDON,"ALLIANCE HOUSE, 12 CAXTON ST, LONDON SW1H0QS, ENGLAND",0029-1277,2224-7955,,HYDROL RES,Hydrol.

Hydrological models may benefit from alternative climate data sources such as the Climate Forecast System Reanalysis (CFSR) weather data. A proposed method was applied to evaluate the applicability of CFSR data in the Soil and Water Assessment Tool (SWAT) eco-hydrological model for the 1.8 x 10(6) km(2) Yangtze River Basin (YRB) in China The CFSR data were first validated by ground-based meteorological station (GMS) data to confirm sufficient accuracy to predict the hydrology for the YRB. It was determined that the CFSR simulation was able to generate acceptable accuracy with calibrated parameters of GMS-based model. The R-2 and ENS of the monthly results from both GMS- and CFSR-SWAT simulations were > 0.70 in both calibration and validation periods. The monthly streamflow hydrograph from GMS and CFSR simulations showed two different patterns: distinct differences in baseflow and less discrepancy for the peak flows, such as the patterns at Cuntan and Yichang gauge stations, whereas the results are characterized as close matches the peaks and the recession periods at Hankou and Datong gauge stations. The CFSR simulation generated better results in the middle and lower reaches than in the upper reach of the basin. To a certain extent, the CFSR provides an alternative to quickly build hydrological model in data scarce area for large basins.","[Lu, J. Z.; Zhang, L.; Cui, X. L.; Chen, X.

The accurate prediction of the streamflow helps in the planning, design, and management of water resources in particular irrigation, hydropower production, flood risk management, and protection for dams. Unexpected and heavy rainfall results in river overflowing which is the leading cause of serious flooding. In this research work, we proposed an effective approach for streamflow forecasting by modeling the rainfall-streamflow relationship. The key objective of this research work is to identify the appropriate set of rainfall patterns to predict the daily river streamflow. This research work is divided into two successive phases. In the first phase of this research, we have identified the different sets of antecedent rainfall combinations. In the second phase, the artificial neural network (ANN) models are developed and trained using each of these different rainfall patterns to forecast daily river streamflow. Finally, the performance of the developed ANN models is evaluated using four different performance metrics including root-mean-squared error (RMSE), correlation coefficient (R), the coefficient of determination (R-2), and Nash-Sutcliffe efficiency coefficient. The results of the research work indicate that the ANN model developed by presenting rainfall patterns of the previous 4 days can precisely predict the daily streamflow with 0.97 and 0.94 value of R-2 for the validation and test period, respectively. The results of the research work also revealed that the architecture of the ANN model and combination of input patterns presented to the model significantly affects the training time, learning ability, and performance of the ANN model. Furthermore, these encouraging results proved that the proposed ANN-based approach can be a useful and effective alternative method for solving hydrological problems.","[Ali, Shahzad] Univ Educ Lahore, Dept Informat Sci, Multan Campus, Multan 60700, Pakistan; [Shahbaz, Muhammad] Univ Engn & Technol, Dept Comp Sci & Engn, Lahore 54890, Pakistan",,"Ali, S (corresponding author), Univ Educ Lahore, Dept Informat Sci, Multan Campus, Multan 60700, Pakistan.",shahzadali039@gmail.com,,,,,,36,13,14,1,5,SPRINGER HEIDELBERG,HEIDELBERG,"TIERGARTENSTRASSE 17, D-69121 HEIDELBERG, GERMANY",2363-6203,2363-6211,,MODEL EARTH SYST ENV,Model.

Market instruments such as forward contracts with specified reliability are considered as a tool that may help address the perceived risk associated with the use of such forecasts in lieu of traditional operation and allocation strategies. A water allocation process that enables multiple contracts for water supply and hydropower production with different durations, while maintaining a prescribed level of flood risk reduction, is presented. The allocation process is supported by an optimization model that considers multitime scale ensemble forecasts of monthly streamflow and flood volume over the upcoming season and year, the desired reliability and pricing of proposed contracts for hydropower and water supply. It solves for the size of contracts at each reliability level that can be allocated for each future period, while meeting target end of period reservoir storage with a prescribed reliability. The contracts may be insurable, given that their reliability is verified through retrospective modeling. The process can allow reservoir operators to overcome their concerns as to the appropriate skill of probabilistic forecasts, while providing water users with short-term and long-term guarantees as to how much water or energy they may be allocated. An application of the optimization model to the Bhakra Dam, India, provides an illustration of the process. The issues of forecast skill and contract performance are examined. A field engagement of the idea is useful to develop a real-world perspective and needs a suitable institutional environment.","[Lu, Mengqian] Hong Kong Univ Sci & Technol, Dept Civil & Environm Engn, Kowloon, Hong Kong, Peoples R China; [Lu, Mengqian; Lall, Upmanu] Columbia Univ, Earth & Environm Engn, New York, NY 10027 USA; [Lall, Upmanu] Columbia Univ, Columbia Water Ctr, New York, NY USA; [Lall, Upmanu; Robertson, Andrew W.] Columbia Univ, Int Res Inst Climate & Soc IRI, Palisades, NY USA; [Cook, Edward] Columbia Univ, Tree Ring Lab, Lamont Doherty Earth Observ, Palisades, NY USA",,"Lu, MQ (corresponding author), Hong Kong Univ Sci & Technol, Dept Civil & Environm Engn, Kowloon, Hong Kong, Peoples R China.; Lu, MQ (corresponding author), Columbia Univ, Earth & Environm Engn, New York, NY 10027 USA.",mengqian.lu@ust.hk,"Robertson, Andrew W/H-7138-2015; Lu, Mengqian/P-2147-2019; Lu, Mengqian/K-9769-2016; Lall, Upmanu/B-7992-2009","Lu, Mengqian/0000-0002-8787-5621; Lall, Upmanu/0000-0003-0529-8128",U.S. Department of Energy (DOE)United States Department of Energy (DOE) [DOE DE-SC0006616],This work was part of the project titled Decadal Prediction and Stochastic Simulation of Hydroclimate Over Monsoon Asia funded by U.S. Department of Energy (DOE) (DOE DE-SC0006616).

Establishing accurate and reliable flood prediction program is the key to deal with flood disasters. Nanshui Reservoir Basin, in southern China, belongs to subtropical monsoon climate, with more rain in spring, concentrated rainstorm in summer and typhoon storm in autumn. Floods at dam site are mostly small and medium-sized floods with steep rise and slow fall as typical mountain flood. In order to explore the applicability of Liuxihe model in flood prediction of Nanshui Reservoir, this paper builds up Liuxihe model for Nanshui Reservoir based on DEM, land use and soil type data, and selects a typical flood event to optimize the parameters using particle swarm optimization (PSO) algorithm and verifies the accuracy of the model by simulating the other floods. Liuxihe model established in this paper indicates a satisfactory performance for flood prediction for Nanshui Reservoir, which can meet the accuracy requirement of flood prediction. Finally, the effects of different river grading and PSO algorithm on flood prediction are discussed. The results show that the PSO algorithm can obviously improve the accuracy of the Liuxihe model for flood forecast in Nanshui Reservoir. The simulation based on four-level channel grading has better results than that based on three-level channel, which indicates increased peak flood value, delayed peak time and closer simulation to the measured value.

Essentially, growing data category and size greatly contribute to solve problems happened in physical space. In this paper, we aim to solve a complex problem that affects both cities and villages, i.e., flood. To reduce impacts induced by floods, hydrological factors acquired from physical space and data-driven models in cyber space have been adopted to accurately forecast floods. Considering the significance of modeling attention capability among hydrology factors, we believe extraction of discriminative hydrology factors not only reflect natural rules in physical space, but also optimally model iterations of factors to forecast run-off values in cyber space. Therefore, we propose a novel data-driven model named as STA-LSTM by integrating Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) structure and spatiotemporal attention module, which is capable of forecasting floods for small- and medium-sized rivers. The proposed spatiotemporal attention module firstly explores spatial relationship between input hydrological factors from different locations and run-off outputs, which assigns time-varying weights to various factors. Afterwards, the proposed attention module allocates temporal-dependent weights to hidden output of each LSTM cell, which describes significance of state output for final forecasting results. Taking Lech and Changhua river basins as cases of physical space, several groups of comparative experiments show that STA-LSTM is capable to optimize complexity of mathematically modeling floods in cyber space.","[Wu, Yirui; Ding, Yukai; Zhu, Yuelong; Feng, Jun] Hohai Univ, Coll Comp & Informat, Nanjing, Peoples R China; [Wang, Sifeng] Qufu Normal Univ, Sch Informat Sci & Engn, Rizhao, Peoples R China",,"Wang, SF (corresponding author), Qufu Normal Univ, Sch Informat Sci & Engn, Rizhao, Peoples R China.",sfwang@qfnu.edu.cn,,"Wang, Sifeng/0000-0003-4244-4091",National Key R&D Program of China [2018YFC0407901]; Natural Science Foundation of ChinaNational Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC) [61702160]; Natural Science Foundation of Jiangsu ProvinceNatural Science Foundation of Jiangsu Province [BK20170892],"This work was supported by National Key R&D Program of China under Grant 2018YFC0407901, Natural Science Foundation of China under Grant 61702160, and Natural Science Foundation of Jiangsu Province under Grant BK20170892.",,37,4,4,1,5,WILEY-HINDAWI,LONDON,"ADAM HOUSE, 3RD FL, 1 FITZROY SQ, LONDON, WIT 5HE, ENGLAND",1076-2787,1099-0526,,COMPLEXITY,Complexity,MAR 26,2020,2020,,,,,,,,7670382,10.1155/2020/7670382,,,13,"Mathematics, Interdisciplinary Applications; Multidisciplinary Sciences",Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),Mathematics; Science & Technology - Other Topics,LC0JT,WOS:000525017700004,,gold,,,2022-02-17

However, little is known about how these factors affect predictions from species distribution models (SDMs) with respect to spatial grain and extent of the models. Objectives Understanding how spatial scale influences the effects of biological processes in SDMs is important because SDMs are one of the primary tools used by conservation biologists to assess biodiversity impacts of climate change. Data sources and study eligibility criteria We systematically reviewed SDM studies published from 2003-2015 using ISI Web of Science searches to: (1) determine the current state and key knowledge gaps of SDMs that incorporate biotic interactions and dispersal; and (2) understand how choice of spatial scale may alter the influence of biological processes on SDM predictions. Synthesis methods and limitations We used linear mixed effects models to examine how predictions from SDMs changed in response to the effects of spatial scale, dispersal, and biotic interactions. Results There were important biases in studies including an emphasis on terrestrial ecosystems in northern latitudes and little representation of aquatic ecosystems. Our results suggest that neither spatial extent nor grain influence projected climate-induced changes in species ranges when SDMs include dispersal or biotic interactions. Conclusions We identified several knowledge gaps and suggest that SDM studies forecasting the effects of climate change should: 1) address broader ranges of taxa and locations; and 1) report the grain size, extent, and results with and without biological complexity. The spatial scale of analysis in SDMs did not affect estimates of projected range shifts with dispersal and biotic interactions. However, the lack of reporting on results with and without biological complexity precluded many studies from our analysis.","[Record, Sydne] Bryn Mawr Coll, Dept Biol, Bryn Mawr, PA 19010 USA; [Strecker, Angela] Portland State Univ, Dept Environm Sci & Management, Portland, OR 97207 USA; [Tuanmu, Mao-Ning] Acad Sinica, Biodivers Res Ctr, Taipei, Taiwan; [Beaudrot, Lydia] Univ Michigan, Dept Ecol & Evolutionary Biol & Michigan Soc Fell, Ann Arbor, MI 48109 USA; [Zarnetske, Phoebe] Michigan State Univ, Dept Forestry, E Lansing, MI 48824 USA; [Zarnetske, Phoebe; Gerstner, Beth] Michigan State Univ, Ecol Evolutionary Biol & Behav Program, E Lansing, MI 48824 USA; [Belmaker, Jonathan] Tel Aviv Univ, Sch Zool, Tel Aviv, Israel; [Belmaker, Jonathan] Tel Aviv Univ, Steinhardt Museum Nat Hist, Tel Aviv, Israel; [Gerstner, Beth] Michigan State Univ, Dept Fisheries & Wildlife, E Lansing, MI 48824 USA",,"Record, S (corresponding author), Bryn Mawr Coll, Dept Biol, Bryn Mawr, PA 19010 USA.",srecord@brynmawr.edu,"Tuanmu, Mao-Ning/ABI-5979-2020; Belmaker, Jonathan/I-1004-2019; Zarnetske, Phoebe/V-3974-2019; Strecker, Angela/E-9430-2016; Beaudrot, L./M-6936-2017","Belmaker, Jonathan/0000-0002-5618-7359; Zarnetske, Phoebe/0000-0001-6257-6951; Strecker, Angela/0000-0001-9387-1654; Record, Sydne/0000-0001-7293-2155; Beaudrot, L./0000-0001-8135-7519","NSF EAGER collaborative grants [1550770, 1550786, 1550765]; Michigan State University (MSU); United States Department of Agriculture National Institute of Food and Agriculture, Hatch Project [1010055]; MSU; Ecological Society of America","This work was funded by NSF EAGER collaborative grants 1550770 (awarded to SR), 1550786 (awarded to AS), and 1550765 (awarded to PLZ).

A Europe-wide analysis of the skill of the newly operational EFAS (European Flood Awareness System) seasonal streamflow forecasts (produced by forcing the Lisflood model with the ECMWF System 4 seasonal climate forecasts), benchmarked against the ensemble streamflow prediction (ESP) forecasting approach (produced by forcing the Lisflood model with historical meteorological observations), is undertaken. The results suggest that, on average, the System 4 seasonal climate forecasts improve the streamflow predictability over historical meteorological observations for the first month of lead time only (in terms of hindcast accuracy, sharpness and overall performance). However, the predictability varies in space and time and is greater in winter and autumn. Parts of Europe additionally exhibit a longer predictability, up to 7 months of lead time, for certain months within a season. In terms of hindcast reliability, the EFAS seasonal streamflow hindcasts are on average less skilful than the ESP for all lead times. The results also highlight the potential usefulness of the EFAS seasonal streamflow forecasts for decision-making (measured in terms of the hindcast discrimination for the lower and upper terciles of the simulated streamflow). Although the ESP is the most potentially useful forecasting approach in Europe, the EFAS seasonal streamflow forecasts appear more potentially useful than the ESP in some regions and for certain seasons, especially in winter for almost 40 % of Europe. Patterns in the EFAS seasonal streamflow hindcast skill are however not mirrored in the System 4 seasonal climate hindcasts, hinting at the need for a better understanding of the link between hydrological and meteorological variables on seasonal timescales, with the aim of improving climate-model-based seasonal streamflow forecasting.","[Arnal, Louise; Cloke, Hannah L.; Stephens, Elisabeth; Neumann, Jessica] Univ Reading, Dept Geog & Environm Sci, Reading RG6 6AB, Berks, England; [Arnal, Louise; Wetterhall, Fredrik; Prudhomme, Christel; Krzeminski, Blazej; Pappenberger, Florian] European Ctr Medium Range Weather Forecasts, Shinfield Pk, Reading RG6 9AX, Berks, England; [Cloke, Hannah L.] Univ Reading, Dept Meteorol, Reading RG6 6BB, Berks, England; [Cloke, Hannah L.] Uppsala Univ, Dept Earth Sci, S-75236 Uppsala, Sweden; [Cloke, Hannah L.] CNDS, Ctr Nat Hazards & Disaster Sci, S-75236 Uppsala, Sweden; [Prudhomme, Christel] Loughborough Univ, Dept Geog, Loughborough LE11 3TU, Leics, England; [Prudhomme, Christel] NERC Ctr Ecol & Hydrol, Wallingford OX10 8BB, Oxon, England",,"Arnal, L (corresponding author), Univ Reading, Dept Geog & Environm Sci, Reading RG6 6AB, Berks, England.; Arnal, L (corresponding author), European Ctr Medium Range Weather Forecasts, Shinfield Pk, Reading RG6 9AX, Berks, England.",l.l.s.arnal@pgr.reading.ac.uk,"Prudhomme, Christel/K-2669-2012; Wetterhall, Fredrik/I-2374-2012; Pappenberger, Florian/A-2839-2009","Prudhomme, Christel/0000-0003-1722-2497; Wetterhall, Fredrik/0000-0001-5331-9064; Pappenberger, Florian/0000-0003-1766-2898; Arnal, Louise/0000-0002-0208-2324; Cloke, Hannah/0000-0002-1472-868X; Stephens, Elisabeth/0000-0002-5439-7563",Horizon IMPREX project [641811]; University of Reading PhD scholarship; EFAS computational centre from JRC-IES [198702]; Natural Environment Research Council and Department for International Development under the Science for Humanitarian Emergencies and Resilience (SHEAR) research programme [NE/P000525/1],"Louise Arnal, Hannah L.

Identifying the degrading factors of the water environment and predicting the trend of eutrophication are key to restore the habitat. Through trophic level index (TLI), water quality index (WQI), modified Nemerow pollution index (NPI), and the Random Forest (RF) model, water samples collected from various estuaries of Taihu Lake from 2017 to 2019 were evaluated. To predict the water quality development, four scenarios were set viz. S1: add or remove an ecological buffer, S2: increase or reduce the external nutrients, S3: open or close the dam/gate, and S4: increase or decrease the internal release. In Wuli Lake, the nutrient concentrations in the river regions were higher than in the lake regions, while a contrary trend was observed in Gonghu Bay. The estuarine water quality in the dry season (WQI = 40.91, NPI = 1.73) was merely worse than that in the wet season (WQI = 47.27, NPI = 1.67). On the other hand, the eutrophic status in the wet season (TLIWet = 57.93) was worse than that in the dry season (TLIDry = 57.23). The estuarine water quality of Taihu Lake has improved from 2017 to 2019 but still belongs to medium level. The principal component analysis (PCA) revealed that dam construction, land use types, unstable hydrodynamic conditions, and trumpet-shaped estuary were the main factors that aggravated the water quality degradation. The RF model has strong forecasting capabilities for estuarine water quality. When the estuaries are close to residential and industrial districts, controlling the surface runoff and improving sewage treatment efficiency are the most effective measures to improve the water quality. In the estuaries, the sediments are usually disturbed by the wind-waves. Conclusively, reducing sediment disturbance and internal contamination accumulation via biological and engineering measures is the key to estuarine restoration.","[Chen, Xi; Wang, Yanhua; Sun, Tian; Chen, Yan; Zhang, Maoheng] Nanjing Normal Univ, Sch Geog, Nanjing 210023, Peoples R China; [Wang, Yanhua] Nanjing Normal Univ, Minist Educ, Key Lab Virtual Geog Environm, Nanjing 210023, Peoples R China; [Wang, Yanhua] Jiangsu Ctr Collaborat Innovat Geog Informat Reso, Nanjing 210023, Peoples R China; [Ye, Chun] Chinese Res Inst Environm Sci, Beijing 100012, Peoples R China",,"Wang, YH (corresponding author), Nanjing Normal Univ, Sch Geog, Nanjing 210023, Peoples R China.; Wang, YH (corresponding author), Nanjing Normal Univ, Minist Educ, Key Lab Virtual Geog Environm, Nanjing 210023, Peoples R China.; Wang, YH (corresponding author), Jiangsu Ctr Collaborat Innovat Geog Informat Reso, Nanjing 210023, Peoples R China.",wangyanhua@njnu.edu.cn,"Wang, Yanhua/A-3808-2014","Wang, Yanhua/0000-0001-8193-3264",National Natural Science Foundation of ChinaNational Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC) [41673107]; National Water Pollution Control and Treatment Science and Technology Major Project [2017ZX07203-005]; Major project of Jiangsu Provincial Department of Education [20KJA170001]; PAPD [164320H116],"This work was supported by the National Natural Science Foundation of China (41673107), National Water Pollution Control and Treatment Science and Technology Major Project (2017ZX07203-005), Major project of Jiangsu Provincial Department of Education (20KJA170001), and PAPD (164320H116).",,69,6,6,9,64,SPRINGER HEIDELBERG,HEIDELBERG,"TIERGARTENSTRASSE 17, D-69121 HEIDELBERG, GERMANY",0944-1344,1614-7499,,ENVIRON SCI POLLUT R,Environ.

Based on water quality hydrodynamic mathematical equations and Digital Elevation Model, a new water pollution accident prediction program for drinking water sources in Three Gorges Reservoir under different hydrological conditions was developed. Moreover, this new program was firstly used to forecast and analyze flow field changes and concentration reduction of a hazardous chemical pollution accident in Huangjuedu drinking water source. By comparing the calculated values and the measured ones of February 10 to February 19, 2016, the maximum relative error was less than 10%, which indicated that the new program was feasible and reasonable. For pollution accident prediction in the drinking water source, the results showed that the maximum transverse velocity had stabilized as 2.070 m/s, 2.411 m/s and 2.717 m/s since 20 min after the accident responding to discharge flow of Xiangjiaba with 1800 m3/s, 2700 m3/s,and 3600 m3/s, respectively. The maximum vertical one was 1.372 m/s, 1.598 m/s and 1.872 m/s respectively since 20 min after accident under the corresponding conditions. Furthermore, the water quality of the drinking water source met the standard 23 min after the accident under the condition that the discharge flow of Xiangjiaba was 1800 m3/s. For conditions that discharge flows were 2700 m3/s and 3600 m3/s, the corresponding times to meet the standard were 21 min and 20 min after the accident, respectively. Thence, relatively large dispatch flows would help reduce the impacts of pollution accidents and accelerate water quality improvement of drinking water sources. This study provides a new and useful tool for predicting the diffusion and migration of pollutants in drinking water sources of Three Gorges Reservoir. And it also gives a practical reference for decision makers to forcast hazardous chemical pollution accidents in drinking water sources. (c) 2021 Elsevier Ltd.

Despite of some studies using machine learning methods in streamflow forecasting, only few studies have been conducted to explore long lead-time forecasting capabilities of these methods, and gain an insight into systematic comparison of model forecasting performance in both the short and long terms. In this work, an artificial neural network (ANN) and a long short term memory (LSTM), a powerful tool for learning long-term temporal dependencies and capturing nonlinear relationship, have been adopted to forecast streamflow at daily and monthly scales for a long lead-time period. For long lead-time streamflow forecasting, a recursive forecasting procedure, which takes the last one-step-ahead forecast as a new input for the next-step-ahead forecast, is used in the ANN and LSTM forecasting systems. Two models are trained and validated for streamflow forecasting using the rainfall and runoff datasets collected from the Nan River Basin and Ping River Basin, Thailand, covering the period 1974 to 2014. To further explore the impact of parameter settings on model performance, two parameters, i.e. the length of time lag and the number of maximum epochs, are examined in the ANN and LSTM models. The main findings are highlighted here. First, with an optimal setting up of model parameters, both the ANN and LSTM model can provide accurate daily forecasting (up to 20 days ahead). Second, in comparison to the ANN model, the LSTM model exhibits better model performance in long lead-time daily forecasting, but less satisfactory in multi-monthly forecasting due to lack of large monthly training dataset. Third, the selection of the length of the time lag and number of maximum epochs used in both ANN and LSTM modelling are the key for long lead-time streamflow forecasting at daily and monthly scales. These findings suggest that the LSTM could be advance in daily streamflow forecasting and thus would be helpful to assist in strategy decisions in water resource management.","[Cheng, M.; Fang, F.; Pain, C.

However, systematic studies have not been performed to examine binary metaheuristic wrapper-based input variable selection (BMWIVS) in real-world streamflow forecasting. In this study, we explored binary metaheuristic-based shallow machine learning wrappers for one-step monthly streamflow forecasting using local weather information and global climate indices from three catchments with different hydroclimatic conditions. First, the maximal information coefficient (MIC) was employed to investigate the correlations among the forecasting target, streamflow and candidate input variables, which included both local and global climate information. Then, the BMWIVS models obtained by combining eight binary metaheuristic algorithms, five commonly used shallow machine learning algorithms, two combined filter-based input variable selection (FIVS) methods, and two forecasting methods were examined. Finally, the performance of each model was compared with the performance of typical benchmark models, including the univariate seasonal autoregressive integrated moving average model, five machine learning algorithms with no input variable selection, and five machine learning algorithms that use five different FIVS methods. The experimental results emphasized three significant findings. First, an appropriate input variable selection method should be selected in practice because several examined wrappers were inferior to the benchmark models. Second, the BMWIVS model that combined the regularized extreme learning machine method, binary gray wolf optimizer, FIVS results-based initialization method, and forecasted values averaged over multiple runs yielded the best performance in the three cases studied. Third, the correlations in terms of the MIC between the global climate indices and streamflow were lower than those between local weather information and streamflow, and the best wrapper and FIVS would select more local weather information variables than global climate index variables, which suggests that global climate information can be complementary to local weather information for one-step monthly streamflow forecasting. These findings have remarkable practical applications for forecasting monthly streamflow.","[Ren, Kun; Qu, Jihong] North China Univ Water Resources & Elect Power, Zhengzhou 450045, Peoples R China; [Wang, Xue] Zheng Zhou Sci & Technol Ind Sch, Zhengzhou 450045, Peoples R China; [Shi, Xiaoyu; Fang, Wei] Xian Univ Technol, Xian 710048, Peoples R China",,"Ren, K (corresponding author), North China Univ Water Resources & Elect Power, Zhengzhou 450045, Peoples R China.",renkun@ncwu.edu.cn; 49079473@qq.com; sxy_xaut@126.com; jh.qu@qq.com; fwmartin@163.com,,,"Doctoral Research Fund of the North China University of Water Resources and Electric Power, China [40464]","This work was financially supported by the Doctoral Research Fund of the North China University of Water Resources and Electric Power, China (40464).

This research investigates how to use the Artificial Neural Network (ANN) to predict the Chemical Oxygen Demand (COD) during river restoration in Wuxi city, China. Specifically, we applied a Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP) using ten neurons in a single hidden layer and seven input variables (Temperature, Dissolved Oxygen, Total Nitrogen, Total Phosphorus, Suspended Sediment, Transparency, and NH3-N) to simulate COD. The modeled results have a correlation coefficient of 0.966, 0.949, and 0.890 with the observations for the raining, validation, and testing phases, respectively. When presenting the trained network to an independent data set, the ANN model still shows a good predictive capability, indicating by a correlation coefficient of 0.978, a root mean square error (RMSE) of 0.628 mg/L, and a mean square error (MSE) of 0.394 mg(2)/L-2. A sensitivity analysis was further implemented to analyze the effect of each of the input variables on prediction of COD. DO, TO, and Transparency have relatively low influences on the estimate of COD, and can be removed from the input variables. The results from this study indicate that ANN models can provide satisfactory estimates of COD during the process of bacterial treatment and is a useful supportive tool for river restoration.","[Ruben, Gebdang B.; Zhang, Ke] Hohai Univ, State Key Lab Hydrol Water Resources & Hydraul En, Nanjing 210098, Jiangsu, Peoples R China; [Ruben, Gebdang B.; Zhang, Ke] Hohai Univ, Coll Hydrol & Water Resources, 1 Xikang Rd, Nanjing 210098, Jiangsu, Peoples R China; [Bao, Hongjun] China Meteorol Adm, Natl Meteorol Ctr, Beijing 100081, Peoples R China; [Ma, Xirong] Pearl River Hydraul Res Inst, Guangzhou 510611, Guangdong, Peoples R China",,"Zhang, K (corresponding author), Hohai Univ, State Key Lab Hydrol Water Resources & Hydraul En, Nanjing 210098, Jiangsu, Peoples R China.; Zhang, K (corresponding author), Hohai Univ, Coll Hydrol & Water Resources, 1 Xikang Rd, Nanjing 210098, Jiangsu, Peoples R China.",kzhang@hhu.edu.cn,"Zhang, Ke/B-3227-2012; Ruben, Gebdang Biangbalbe/N-2796-2015","Zhang, Ke/0000-0001-5288-9372; Ruben, Gebdang Biangbalbe/0000-0002-8933-655X",National Key Research and Development Program of China [2016YFC0402701]; Research Funds of State Key Laboratory of Hydrology-Water Resources and Hydraulic Engineering [20165042212]; Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities of ChinaFundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities [2015B28514]; Priority Academic Program Development of Jiangsu Higher Education Institutions,"This study was partially supported by National Key Research and Development Program of China (2016YFC0402701), the Research Funds of State Key Laboratory of Hydrology-Water Resources and Hydraulic Engineering (20165042212), the Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities of China (2015B28514), and the Priority Academic Program Development of Jiangsu Higher Education Institutions.",,27,17,18,5,28,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0920-4741,1573-1650,,WATER RESOUR MANAG,Water Resour.

In this study, wavelet-gene expression programming (WGEP) and wavelet-M5 prime (WM5P) techniques, as two robust artificial intelligence (AI) models, were applied for forecasting the monthly streamflow in Khoshkroud and Polroud Rivers located in two basins with the same names. Results of hybrid AI techniques were compared with those achieved by two stand-alone models of GEP and M5P. Seven combinations of hydrological (H) and meteorological (M) variables were considered to investigate the effect of climatic variables on the performance of the proposed techniques. Moreover, the performance of both stand-alone and hybrid models were evaluated by statistical criteria of correlation of coefficient, root-mean-square error, index of agreement, the Nash-Sutcliffe model efficiency coefficient, and relative improvement. The statistical results revealed that there is a dependency between 'the M5P and GEP performance' and 'the geometric properties of basins (e.g., area, shape, slope, and river network density)'. It was found that a preprocessed technique could increase the performance of M5P and GEP models. Compared to the stand-alone techniques, the hybrid AI models resulted in higher performance. For both basins, the performance of the WM5P model was higher than the WGEP model, especially for extreme events. Overall, the results demonstrated that the proposed hybrid AI approaches are reliable tools for forecasting the monthly streamflow, while the meteorological and hydrometric variables are taken into account.","[Azarpira, Fariba; Shahabi, Sajad] Grad Univ Adv Technol, Fac Civil & Surveying Engn, Dept Water Engn, Kerman, Iran",,"Shahabi, S (corresponding author), Grad Univ Adv Technol, Fac Civil & Surveying Engn, Dept Water Engn, Kerman, Iran.",s.shahabi@kgut.ac.ir,,"Shahabi, Sajad/0000-0003-1124-7685",,,,42,0,0,1,1,IWA PUBLISHING,LONDON,"REPUBLIC-EXPORT BLDG, UNITS 1 04 & 1 05, 1 CLOVE CRESCENT, LONDON, ENGLAND",1464-7141,1465-1734,,J HYDROINFORM,J.

Recent work suggests that the two major avenues to advance seasonal predictability are improvements in the estimation of initial hydrologic conditions (IHCs) and the incorporation of climate information. This study investigates the marginal benefits of a variety of methods using IHCs and/or climate information, focusing on seasonal water supply forecasts (WSFs) in five case study watersheds located in the US Pacific Northwest region. We specify two benchmark methods that mimic standard operational approaches - statistical regression against IHCs and model-based ensemble streamflow prediction (ESP) - and then systematically intercompare WSFs across a range of lead times. Additional methods include (i) statistical techniques using climate information either from standard indices or from climate reanalysis variables and (ii) several hybrid/hierarchical approaches harnessing both land surface and climate predictability. In basins where atmospheric tele-connection signals are strong, and when watershed predictability is low, climate information alone provides considerable improvements. For those basins showing weak tele-connections, custom predictors from reanalysis fields were more effective in forecast skill than standard climate indices. ESP predictions tended to have high correlation skill but greater bias compared to other methods, and climate predictors failed to substantially improve these deficiencies within a trace weighting framework. Lower complexity techniques were competitive with more complex methods, and the hierarchical expert regression approach introduced here (hierarchical ensemble streamflow prediction - HESP) provided a robust alternative for skillful and reliable water supply forecasts at all initialization times. Three key findings from this effort are (1) objective approaches supporting methodologically consistent hindcasts open the door to a broad range of beneficial forecasting strategies; (2) the use of climate predictors can add to the seasonal forecast skill available from IHCs; and (3) sample size limitations must be handled rigorously to avoid over-trained forecast solutions. Overall, the results suggest that despite a rich, long heritage of operational use, there remain a number of compelling opportunities to improve the skill and value of seasonal streamflow predictions.","[Mendoza, Pablo A.; Wood, Andrew W.; Clark, Martyn P.] Natl Ctr Atmospher Res, Hydrometeorol Applicat Program, POB 3000, Boulder, CO 80307 USA; [Clark, Elizabeth; Nijssen, Bart] Univ Washington, Dept Civil & Environm Engn, Seattle, WA 98195 USA; [Rothwell, Eric] Bur Reclamat, Boise, ID USA; [Brekke, Levi D.] Bur Reclamat, Denver, CO USA; [Arnold, Jeffrey R.] US Army Corps Engineers, Climate Preparedness & Resilience Programs, Seattle, WA USA; [Mendoza, Pablo A.] Univ Chile, Adv Min Technol Ctr, Santiago, Chile",,"Mendoza, PA (corresponding author), Natl Ctr Atmospher Res, Hydrometeorol Applicat Program, POB 3000, Boulder, CO 80307 USA.; Mendoza, PA (corresponding author), Univ Chile, Adv Min Technol Ctr, Santiago, Chile.",pablo.mendoza@amtc.uchile.cl,"Nijssen, Bart/B-1013-2012; Clark, Martyn/AAH-9999-2020; Mendoza, Pablo/AAT-2649-2021; Wood, Andrew/L-5133-2013","Nijssen, Bart/0000-0002-4062-0322; Clark, Martyn/0000-0002-2186-2625; Mendoza, Pablo/0000-0002-0263-9698; Wood, Andrew/0000-0002-6231-0085; Clark, Elizabeth/0000-0002-6273-1592",US Army Corps of EngineersUnited States Department of Defense; US Bureau of Reclamation,This work was supported through a contract with the US Army Corps of Engineers and through a cooperative agreement with the US Bureau of Reclamation.,,67,37,38,2,24,COPERNICUS GESELLSCHAFT MBH,GOTTINGEN,"BAHNHOFSALLEE 1E, GOTTINGEN, 37081, GERMANY",1027-5606,1607-7938,,HYDROL EARTH SYST SC,Hydrol.

Thus, forecasting cultivated area in artificial oases under climate change and human activities is of great significance. In this study, an approach named GD-HM-PSWROAM, consisting of general circulation model downscaling (GD), hydrological model (HM), and planting structure and water resource optimal allocation model (PSWROAM), was developed and applied in the irrigation district of the Manas River Basin in Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region of China to forecast the cultivated area tendency. Furthermore, the catchment export of the MIKE11 HD/NAM model was set to the Kensiwate hydrological station. The results show that the downscaling effects of temperature can be fairly satisfying, while those of precipitation may be not satisfying but acceptable. Simulation capacity of the MIKE11 HD/NAM model on the discharge in the Kensiwate hydrological station can meet the requirements of running the PSWROAM. The accuracy of the PSWROAM indicated that this model can perform well in predicting the change of cultivated area at the decadal scale. The cultivated area in the Manas River Basin under current human activities may be generally decreasing due to the climate change. But the adverse effects of climate change can be weakened or even eliminated through positive human activities. The cultivated area in the Manas River Basin may even be increasing under assumed human activities and future climate scenarios. The effects of human activities in the future can be generally predicted and quantified according to the cultivated area trends under current human activities and the situations in the study area. Overall, it is rational and acceptable to forecast the cultivated area tendency in artificial oases under future climate change and human activities through the GD-HM-PSWROAM approach.","[Zhang, Shaobo; Chen, Jie] Wuhan Univ, Sch Water Resources & Hydropower Engn, Wuhan 430081, Hubei, Peoples R China; [Chen, Fulong; Wang, Jing; Long, Aihua] Shihezi Univ, Coll Water Conservancy Architectural Engn, Shihezi 832000, Peoples R China; [Li, Shaofei] Tianjin Agr Univ, Dept Hydraul Engn, Tianjin 300384, Peoples R China; [Long, Aihua] China Inst Water Resources & Hydropower Res, State Key Lab Simulat & Regulat Water Cycle River, Beijing 100038, Peoples R China",,"Chen, FL (corresponding author), Shihezi Univ, Coll Water Conservancy Architectural Engn, Shihezi 832000, Peoples R China.",chenfulong1228@sina.com,,"Long, Aihua/0000-0002-3920-2086",National Key Research and Development Program of China [2017YFC0404301]; National Natural Science Foundation of ChinaNational Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC) [51769029]; National Science-technology Support Plan Projects of China [2015BAD24B02]; Foundation of Tianjin Municipal Science and Technology Commission [15JCZDJC41400],"The research was supported by the National Key Research and Development Program of China (2017YFC0404301), the National Natural Science Foundation of China (51769029), the National Science-technology Support Plan Projects of China (2015BAD24B02), and the Foundation of Tianjin Municipal Science and Technology Commission (15JCZDJC41400).

The ensemble precipitation forecast with the hydrological model was employed for inflow prediction of the study basin which was located in a tropical climate with a distinct wet and dry season. The initial conditions of the hydrological model largely influenced the real-time inflow forecast. To determine the initial conditions of the model, the empirical data assimilation considering a drainage area factor was utilized and observed pre-cipitation data were used for model input forcing data during the initial analysis period. This method improved the reservoir inflow prediction and real-time reservoir optimization using dynamic programming with considering ensemble forecasts provided more efficient operating decisions than employing historical data. The resulting information will be useful for water resource management, which may be adapted to other basins in the study region.","[Meema, Thatkiat; Tachikawa, Yasuto; Ichikawa, Yutaka; Yorozu, Kazuaki] Kyoto Univ, Dept Civil & Earth Resources Engn, Kyoto, Japan",,"Meema, T (corresponding author), Kyoto Univ, Dept Civil & Earth Resources Engn, Nishikyo Ku, C1, Kyoto 6158540, Japan.",meema.thatkiat.42r@st.kyoto-u.ac.jp,,,"Council for Science, Technology and Innovation (CSTI) of Japan, Cross-ministerial Strategic Innovation Promotion Program (SIP), Enhancement of National Resilience against Natural Disasters (Funding agency: National Research Institute for Earth Science an","This work is based on TIGGE data.

Numerical models can provide estimates of groundwater age, enabling interpretation of measured age tracers. However, to extend to national-scale groundwater systems where numerical models are not routinely available, a more efficient metamodeling approach can provide a less precise but widely applicable estimate of groundwater age, trained to make forecasts based on predictor variables that can be measured independent of numerical models. We trained gradient-boosted regression tree statistical metamodels to MODFLOW/MODPATH-derived groundwater age estimates in five inset models in the Lake Michigan Basin, USA. Using high-throughput computing, we explored an exhaustive range of tuning parameters and tested metamodels through cross validation, a 20% holdout, and a round robin approach among the five inset models withholding each inset model from training and testing on the held-out inset model. Forecast skill-measured by Nash Sutcliffe efficiency-was high for age-related responses in the 20% hold-out case (ranging from 0.73 to 0.84). The round robin analysis provided the opportunity to explore extending to unmodeled areas and a greater range of skill indicated the need to evaluate when it is appropriate to apply a metamodel from one region to another. We further explored the ramifications of metamodel simplification achieved through removing predictor variables based on their estimated importance. We found that similar metamodel performance was achievable with a fraction of the candidate set of predictor variables with well construction variables being most important. Plain Language Summary Constructing computer models of groundwater and making forecasts to help water resource managers can both be time consuming. Metamodeling takes advantage of recent advances in artificial intelligence to make simple, fast-running statistical models learned from paired inputs and outputs generated by a more complicated computer model. These metamodels are easier to construct, based on salient environmental characteristics, which can be obtained using maps spanning large scale. When metamodels adequately duplicate the underlying model behavior, they can be extended into previously unmodeled areas. In this work, we created metamodels to forecast groundwater age in pumping wells in the Lake Michigan Basin. Groundwater extracted from wells represents a mixture of water ranging in age from recent to thousands of years old. Water younger than 65years old is more likely to contain nitrate as this time period saw high use of inorganic nitrogen for agricultural fertilizer resulting in nitrate entering the groundwater. The ability to rapidly create a metamodel of a previously unmodeled area allows forecasting and mapping groundwater age over large regions. Our metamodels reproduce 73% to 84% of the underlying training model information. This prototype screening approach, with age indicating nitrate vulnerability, can be extended for planning new well locations throughout the glaciated northern United States.","[Fienen, Michael N.] US Geol Survey, Upper Midwest Water Sci Ctr, Middleton, WI 53562 USA; [Nolan, B.

In this paper, we are focused on investigating and confront the following forecasting approaches: i) use of a single model for the whole series (annual approach) versus using 12 models, each one responsible for predicting each month (monthly approach); ii) for multistep forecasting, the use of direct and recursive methods. The forecasting models addressed are the linear Autoregressive (AR) and Periodic Autoregressive (PAR) models, from the Box & Jenkins family, and the Extreme Learning Machines (ELM), an artificial neural network architecture. The computational analysis involves 20 time series associated with hydroelectric plants indicated that the monthly approach with the direct multistep method achieved the best overall performances, except for the cases in which the coefficient of variation is higher than two. In this case, the recursive approach stood out.

Traits may influence different aspects of range shifts, with trophic generality facilitating shifts at the leading edge, and greater thermal tolerance limiting contractions at the trailing edge. The generality of relationships between traits and range shifts remains ambiguous however, especially for imperiled fishes residing in xeric riverscapes. Our objectives were to quantify contemporary fish distributions in the Lower Colorado River Basin, forecast climate change by 2085 using two general circulation models, and quantify shifts in the limits, center, and size of fish elevational ranges according to fish traits. We examined relationships among traits and range shift metrics either singly using univariate linear modeling or combined with multivariate redundancy analysis. We found that trophic and dispersal traits were associated with shifts at the leading and trailing edges, respectively, although projected range shifts were largely unexplained by traits. As expected, piscivores and omnivores with broader diets shifted upslope most at the leading edge while more specialized invertivores exhibited minimal changes. Fishes that were more mobile shifted upslope most at the trailing edge, defying predictions. No traits explained changes in range center or size. Finally, current preference explained multivariate range shifts, as fishes with faster current preferences exhibited smaller multivariate changes. Although range shifts were largely unexplained by traits, more specialized invertivorous fishes with lower dispersal propensity or greater current preference may require the greatest conservation efforts because of their limited capacity to shift ranges under climate change.","[Whitney, James E.] Univ Missouri, Dept Fisheries & Wildlife Sci, Missouri Cooperat Fish & Wildlife Res Unit, 302 Anheuser Busch Nat Resources Bldg, Columbia, MO 65211 USA; [Whittier, Joanna B.] Univ Missouri, Dept Fisheries & Wildlife Sci, 302 Anheuser Busch Nat Resources Bldg, Columbia, MO 65211 USA; [Paukert, Craig P.] Univ Missouri, Dept Fisheries & Wildlife Sci, US Geol Survey, Missouri Cooperat Fish & Wildlife Res Unit, 302 Anheuser Busch Nat Resources Bldg, Columbia, MO 65211 USA; [Olden, Julian D.] Univ Washington, Sch Aquat & Fishery Sci, Seattle, WA 98195 USA; [Strecker, Angela L.] Portland State Univ, Dept Environm Sci & Management, 1719 SW 10th Ave, Portland, OR 97201 USA; [Whitney, James E.] Pittsburg State Univ, Dept Biol, 223 Heckert Wells Hall, Pittsburg, KS 66762 USA",,"Whitney, JE (corresponding author), Pittsburg State Univ, Dept Biol, 223 Heckert Wells Hall, Pittsburg, KS 66762 USA.",jewhitney@pittstate.edu,"Whittier, Jodi/V-3683-2019; Olden, Julian D/A-8535-2010; Strecker, Angela/E-9430-2016","Whittier, Jodi/0000-0002-1048-9490; Paukert, Craig/0000-0002-9369-8545; Olden, Julian/0000-0003-2143-1187; Strecker, Angela/0000-0001-9387-1654",U.S. National Aquatic Gap Analysis Program; U.S. National Climate Change and Wildlife Sciences Center; U.S. Fish and Wildlife ServiceUS Fish & Wildlife Service; Missouri Department of Conservation; University of Missouri; U.S. Geological SurveyUnited States Geological Survey; Wildlife Management Institute,"We thank the U.S. National Aquatic Gap Analysis Program, the U.S. National Climate Change and Wildlife Sciences Center, and the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service for funding provided to complete this project.

The preservation and improvement of the quality of our impaired urban streams are at the core of the global challenge of ensuring water sustainability. This work adopted a genetic-algorithm (GA)-optimized long short-term memory (LSTM) technique to predict river water temperature (WT) as a key indicator of the health state of the aquatic habitat, where its modeling is crucial for effective urban water quality management. To our knowledge, this is the first attempt to adopt a GA-LSTM to predict the WT in urban rivers. In recent research trends, large volumes of real-time water quality data, including water temperature, conductivity, pH, and turbidity, are constantly being collected. Specifically, in the field of water quality management, this provides countless opportunities for understanding water quality impairment and forecasting, and to develop models for aquatic habitat assessment purposes. The main objective of this research was to develop a reliable and simple urban river water temperature forecasting tool using advanced machine learning methods that can be used in conjunction with a real-time network of water quality monitoring stations for proactive water quality management. We proposed a hybrid time series regression model for WT forecasting. This hybrid approach was applied to solve problems regarding the time window size and architectural factors (number of units) of the LSTM network. We have chosen an hourly water temperature record collected over 5 years as the input. Furthermore, to check its robustness, a recurrent neural network (RNN) was also tested as a benchmark model and the performances were compared. The experimental results revealed that the hybrid model of the GA-LSTM network outperformed the RNN and the basic problem of determining the optimal time window and number of units of the memory cell was solved. This research concluded that the GA-LSTM can be used as an advanced deep learning technique for time series analysis.","[Stajkowski, Stephen; Gharabaghi, Bahram] Univ Guelph, Sch Engn, Guelph, ON NIG 2W1, Canada; [Kumar, Deepak; Samui, Pijush] Natl Inst Technol Patna, Dept Civil Engn, Patna 800001, Bihar, India; [Bonakdari, Hossein] Laval Univ, Dept Soils & Agrifood Engn, Quebec City, PQ G1V0A6, Canada",,"Gharabaghi, B (corresponding author), Univ Guelph, Sch Engn, Guelph, ON NIG 2W1, Canada.",stajkows@uoguelph.ca; decage007@gmail.com; pijushsamui@gmail.com; hossein.bonakdari@fsaa.ulaval.ca; bgharaba@uoguelph.ca,"samui, pijush/W-5860-2019; Gharabaghi, Bahram/F-9977-2016; Bonakdari, Hossein/AAW-5398-2021; Bonakdari, Hossein/B-9305-2018","Gharabaghi, Bahram/0000-0003-0454-2811; Bonakdari, Hossein/0000-0001-6169-3654",Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada (NSERC)Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada (NSERC) [400675]; Ontario Ministry of Transportation Grant [050235],This research was funded by the Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada (NSERC) Discovery Grant (#400675) and was in partnership with an Ontario Ministry of Transportation Grant (#050235).,,70,15,16,9,23,MDPI,BASEL,"ST ALBAN-ANLAGE 66, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND",,2071-1050,,SUSTAINABILITY-BASEL,Sustainability,JUL,2020,12,13,,,,,,,5374,10.3390/su12135374,,,17,Green & Sustainable Science & Technology; Environmental Sciences; Environmental Studies,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Science & Technology - Other Topics; Environmental Sciences & Ecology,MM5LU,WOS:000550198800001,,gold,,,2022-02-17

Hence, this research tries to develop a hybrid model for accurate monthly streamflow prediction, where the ensemble empirical mode decomposition (EEMD) is firstly used to decompose the original streamflow data into a finite amount of intrinsic mode functions (IMFs) and a residue; and then the extreme learning machine (ELM) is employed to forecast each IMFs and the residue, while an improved gravitational search algorithm (IGSA) based on elitist-guide evolution strategies, selection operator and mutation operator is used to select the parameters of all the ELM models; finally, the summarized predicated results for all the subcomponents are treated as the final forecasting result. The hybrid method is applied to forecast the monthly runoff of Three Gorges in China, while four quantitative indexes are used to test the performances of the developed forecasting models.

Global environmental change including climate and land use change can increase the transport of ions into surface waters. We fit both multiple linear regression (LR) and random forest (RF) models on a large spatial dataset to predict Ca2+ (266 sites), Mg2+ (266 sites), and SO42- (357 sites) ion concentrations as well as electrical conductivity (EC-a proxy for total dissolved solids with 410 sites) in German running water bodies. Predictions in both types of models were driven by the major factors controlling salinity including geologic and soil properties, climate, vegetation and topography. The predictive power of the two types of models was very similar, with RF explaining 71-76% of the spatial variation in ion concentrations and LR explaining 70-75% of the variance. Mean squared errors for predictions were all smaller than 0.06. The factors most strongly associated with stream ion concentrations varied among models but rock chemistry and climate were the most dominant. The RF model was subsequently used to forecast the changes in EC that were likely to occur for the period of 2070 to 2100 in response to just climate change-i.e. no additional effects of other anthropogenic activities. The future forecasting shows approximately 10% and 15% increases in mean EC for representative concentration pathways 2.6 and 8.5 (RCP2.6 and RCP8.5) scenarios, respectively.

Anticipatory water management in the basin including reservoir operations, barrage gate operation for releasing water for irrigation and flood control also require reliable rainfall and runoff prediction in the sub basin. In this study, the Regional Climate Model (RegCM V4.4.5.11) is calibrated for the basin to dynamically downscale reanalysis weather data of Global Climate Model (GCM) to forecast the rainfall in the basin. Observed rainfalls at gauging stations within the basin were used for model calibration and validation. The observed rainfall data was analysed using ARC GIS and the output of RegCM was analysed using GrADS tool. The output of the model and the observed precipitation were obtained on grids of size 0.1 degrees and the accuracy of the predictions were analysed using RMSE and Mean Model Absolute Error percentage (MAME %). The predictions by the calibrated RegCM model for the basin is shown to be satisfactory. The model is a useful tool for rainfall forecast in the Upper Mahaweli River basin.","[Muhammadh, K.

These forecasts are potentially valuable for informing strategic multisector decisions, including irrigated agriculture, for which they can improve crop choices and irrigation scheduling. In this operational context, the accuracy associated with the forecast system setup does not necessarily yield proportional marginal benefit, as this is also affected by how forecasts are employed by end users. This paper aims at quantifying the value of hydroclimatic forecasts in terms of potential economic benefit to the end users, which allows for the inference of a relation between gains in forecast skill and gains in end user profit. We also explore the sensitivity of this benefit to both forecast system setup and end user behavioral factors. These analyses are supported by an evaluation framework demonstrated on the Lake Como system (Italy), a regulated lake operated for flood protection and irrigation supply. Our framework relies on an integrated modeling chain composed of three building blocks: bias-adjusted seasonal meteorological forecasts are used as input to the continentally calibrated E-HYPE hydrological model; predicted lake inflows are used for conditioning the daily lake operations; and the resulting lake releases feed an agricultural model to estimate the net profit of the farmers in a downstream irrigation district. Results suggest that despite the gain in average conditions being negligible, informing the operations of Lake Como based on seasonal hydrological forecasts during intense drought episodes allows about 15 % of the farmers' profit to be gained with respect to a baseline solution not informed by any forecast. Moreover, our analysis suggests that behavioral factors capturing different perceptions of risk and uncertainty significantly impact the quantification of the benefit to the end users, whereby the estimated forecast value is potentially undermined by different levels of end user risk aversion. Lastly, our results show an intricate skill-to-value relation modulated by the underlying hydrologic conditions, which is well aligned over an exponential function in dry years, while the gains in profit are almost insensitive to the improvements in forecast skill in wet years.","[Giuliani, Matteo; Castelletti, Andrea] Politecn Milan, Dept Elect Informat & Bioengn, Piazza L da Vinci 32, I-20133 Milan, Italy; [Crochemore, Louise; Pechlivanidis, Ilias] Swedish Meteorol & Hydrol Inst SMHI, Hydrol Res Unit, Folkborgsvagen 17, S-60176 Norrkoping, Sweden",,"Giuliani, M (corresponding author), Politecn Milan, Dept Elect Informat & Bioengn, Piazza L da Vinci 32, I-20133 Milan, Italy.",matteo.giuliani@polimi.it,"Pechlivanidis, Ilias/AAC-6979-2019","Pechlivanidis, Ilias/0000-0002-3416-317X; Crochemore, Louise/0000-0001-5776-6275; Giuliani, Matteo/0000-0002-4780-9347; Castelletti, Andrea/0000-0002-7923-1498",European Commission under the IMPREX project [641811]; EU Horizon 2020 project S2S4E (Subseasonal to seasonal forecasting for the energy sector) [776787],The work has been partially funded by the European Commission under the IMPREX project belonging to the Horizon 2020 framework programme (grant no. 641811).

The objective of this research is to develop an approach (1) to identify the best model forecast from multiple integrations of various hydrological models and numerical weather predictions (NWP), and (2) to find the best forecast combination method for an improved short-range flood forecasting. Seven selected hydrological models were coupled, each with two high-resolution NWP forecasts to provide several alternatives of deterministic hydrological forecasts at a catchment outlet. As such, the different model-input combinations were used to generate 14 hydrological forecasts. Hydrological forecast verification was then carried out over a one-year hind-cast period. A comparison between six forecast combination methods, including a benchmark Bayesian model averaging (BMA) method, was also performed for the multiple available short-term streamflow forecasts. Results indicate that the coupling of the Sacramento soil moisture accounting (SACSMA) model with both High-Resolution Deterministic Precipitation System and High-Resolution Rapid Refresh inputs outperformed other model-input integrations. Maximum forecast errors in all model-input integration outputs occurred at forecast lead times of 12-14 h, corresponding to the time of concentration of the catchment. Providing constraints on the estimation of model weights was found to be a significant factor for obtaining an improved combined streamflow forecast. In general, the regression-based forecast combination method of the constrained ordinary least squares (CLS) has emerged as a possible alternative to the widely used BMA method for hydrology application.

To determine how the characteristics of supply and demand in a water-coupled system will vary under the influence of climate change and human activity in this area in the next 85 years, the upper Yangtze basin was considered as the study area and was divided into seven sub-basins according to seven main control sections: Shigu, Panzhihua, Xiluodu, Xiangjiaba, Zhutuo, Cuntan, and Yichang; a method for water supply and demand research considering climate change was proposed. Based on simulated runoff in the study area under changing environmental conditions, this study analyzed the available water supply and constructed a long-term water demand forecasting model using the classified water use index method under macro regulation in the study area from 2016 to 2100. The results show that the total water demand in the upstream Yangtze River appears to first increase and then decrease in 2016-2100 and will reach its peak around 2028. The ecological pressure in the upstream Yangtze River increases gradually from upstream to downstream but will not reach the surface water utilization stress threshold (hereinafter referred to as stress threshold) for the next 85 years. The contradiction between monthly supply and demand is more prominent under ecological restrictions. Under the RCP4.5 scenario, water demand exceeds the stress threshold in each sub-basin across several months (mainly March, April, and May), and the water demand nearly reaches the damage threshold in May as the basin extends below the Zhutuo section.","[Lou, Sijing; Mo, Li; Zhou, Jianzhong] Huazhong Univ Sci & Technol, Sch Civil & Hydraul Engn, Wuhan 430074, Peoples R China; [Wang, Yongqiang] Changjiang River Sci Res Inst Changjiang Water Re, Inst Comprehens Utilizat Water Resources, Wuhan 430074, Peoples R China; [He, Wenhao] Hanjiang Water Resources & Hydropower Grp Co LTD, Wuhan 430074, Peoples R China",,"Mo, L (corresponding author), Huazhong Univ Sci & Technol, Sch Civil & Hydraul Engn, Wuhan 430074, Peoples R China.",sijing_lou@hust.edu.cn; moli@hust.edu.cn; jz.zhou@hust.edu.cn; wangyq@mail.crsri.cn; hewh_91@163.com,,,"National Natural Science Foundation of ChinaNational Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC) [51979114, 51479075]; Fundamental Research Funds for the Central UniversitiesFundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities [2017KFYXJJ199]; Open Foundation of State Key Laboratory of Hydrology-Water Resources and Hydraulic Engineering [2014491811]","This work was supported by the National Natural Science Foundation of China (No. 51979114 & No. 51479075), the Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities (No. 2017KFYXJJ199) and Open Foundation of State Key Laboratory of Hydrology-Water Resources and Hydraulic Engineering (2014491811).",,52,0,0,10,12,MDPI,BASEL,"ST ALBAN-ANLAGE 66, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND",,2073-4441,,WATER-SUI,Water,MAR,2021,13,5,,,,,,,640,10.3390/w13050640,,,24,Environmental Sciences; Water Resources,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),Environmental Sciences & Ecology; Water Resources,QW5GR,WOS:000628678600001,,gold,,,2022-02-17

In situ and satellite-based precipitation are analyzed to assess the amount of water received as precipitation in the river basin (Mekong basin water), in particular, the amount each country receives. Laos, Thailand, and Cambodia contribute -75% of the basin water during March-September, whereas China's contribution is 10%-15%, except in winter when it rises to 25%. The processing of Mekong basin water into Mekong streamflow entails accounting for the uncertain water losses but, interestingly, interannual variations in Mekong basin water can be processed into Mekong streamflow using a simple hydrologic model, which is validated using monthly river discharge data from four stations. Preliminary evidence for the impact of upbasin dams on downstream flow, especially the timing of peak summer flow, is presented. Characterization of El Nifio's influence on SE Asian rainfall reveals significant rainfall reductions in the fall preceding and the spring following El Nirio's peak phase (winter); such reductions at the bookends of the dry season in SE Asia (winter) generate droughts, as in 2015-16. The linear trend in twentieth-century rainfall assesses the vulnerability of the region to climate change. The analysis indicates the feasibility of streamflow prediction using a simple hydrologic model driven by high-resolution precipitation observations and forecasts. It raises the prospects of drought prediction based on El Nirio's emergence/forecast. Finally, by showing the Mekong to be largely a rain-fed and not snowmelt-fed river, it provides quantitative context for assessing the notion of Chinese control on the lower Mekong via upbasin dams.","[Ruiz-Barradas, Alfredo; Nigam, Sumant] Univ Maryland, Dept Atmospher & Ocean Sci, College Pk, MD 20742 USA; [Nigam, Sumant] Natl Acad Sci, Jefferson Sci Fellowship Program, 2101 Constitut Ave Nw, Washington, DC 20418 USA",,"Nigam, S (corresponding author), Univ Maryland, Dept Atmospher & Ocean Sci, College Pk, MD 20742 USA.; Nigam, S (corresponding author), Natl Acad Sci, Jefferson Sci Fellowship Program, 2101 Constitut Ave Nw, Washington, DC 20418 USA.",nigam@umd.edu,,,National Academy of Sciences; University of Maryland; National Science Foundation through NSFNational Science Foundation (NSF) [AGS1439940],"The effort was motivated by the second author's affiliation with the U.S. State Department's Lower Mekong Initiative (LMI) through the Jefferson Science Fellowship from the National Academy of Sciences.

We present a geographic information system (GIS)-based tool that combines meteorological forecasts with river flow and algal biomass datasets to identify river reaches where additional stresses on fish health may produce an increased risk of mass fish deaths. At present the tool is still in development and will require the addition of extra datasets and testing using historical datasets to further validate its accuracy.

In this regard, the principal component analysis was performed on the input time series decomposed by a discrete wavelet transform to feed the ANN/ANFIS models. The models were applied for dissolved oxygen (DO) forecasting in rivers which is an important variable affecting aquatic life and water quality. The current values of DO, water surface temperature, salinity, and turbidity have been considered as the input variable to forecast DO in a three-time step further. The results of the study revealed that PCA can be employed as a powerful tool for dimension reduction of input variables and also to detect inter-correlation of input variables. Results of the PCA-wavelet-ANN models are compared with those obtained from wavelet-ANN models while the earlier one has the advantage of less computational time than the later models. Dealing with ANFIS models, PCA is more beneficial to avoid wavelet-ANFIS models creating too many rules which deteriorate the efficiency of the ANFIS models. Moreover, manipulating the wavelet-ANFIS models utilizing PCA leads to a significant decreasing in computational time. Finally, it was found that the PCA-wavelet-ANN/ANFIS models can provide reliable forecasts of dissolved oxygen as an important water quality indicator in rivers.","[Meng, Yinghui] Zhengzhou Univ Light Ind, Sch Comp & Commun Engn, Zhengzhou 450002, Peoples R China; [Qasem, Sultan Noman] Al Imam Mohammad Ibn Saud Islamic Univ IMSIU, Coll Comp & Informat Sci, Comp Sci Dept, Riyadh 11432, Saudi Arabia; [Qasem, Sultan Noman] Taiz Univ, Fac Appl Sci, Comp Sci Dept, Taizi, Yemen; [Shokri, Manouchehr] Bauhaus Univ Weimar, Fac Civil Engn, Inst Struct Mech ISM, D-99423 Weimar, Germany; [Shahab, S.] Duy Tan Univ, Inst Res & Dev, Da Nang 550000, Vietnam",,"Shahab, S (corresponding author), Duy Tan Univ, Inst Res & Dev, Da Nang 550000, Vietnam.",yinghuimeng@zzuli.edu.cn; SNMohammed@imamu.edu.sa; Manouchehr.shokri@uni-weimar.de; shamshirbandshahaboddin@duytan.edu.vn,"S.Band, Shahab/ABI-7388-2020; S.

However, due to the complexity of internally physical mechanisms in streamflow process and the influence of many random factors, long-term streamflow forecasting is a difficult issue. In the article, we mainly investigated the ability of the Relevance Vector Machine (RVM) model and its applicability for long-term streamflow forecasting. We chose the Dahuofang (DHF) Reservoir in Northern China and the Danjiangkou (DJK) Reservoir in Central China as the study sites, and selected the 500 hpa geopotential height in the northern hemisphere and the sea surface temperatures in the North Pacific as the predictor factors of the RVM model and the Support Vector Machine (SVM) model, and then conducted annual streamflow forecasting. Results indicate that forecasting results in the DHF Reservoir is much better than that in the DJK Reservoir when using SVM, because streamflow process in the latter basin has a magnitude bigger than 1000 m(3)/s. Comparatively, accurate forecasting results in both the two basins can be gotten using the RVM model, with the Nash Sutcliffe efficiency coefficient bigger than 0.7, and they are much better than those gotten from the SVM model. As a result, the RVM model can be an effective approach for long-term streamflow forecasting, and it also has a wide applicability for the streamflow process with a discharge magnitude from dozen to thousand cubic meter per second.","[Liu, Yong; Sang, Yan-Fang; Li, Xinxin; Hu, Jian; Liang, Kang] Chinese Acad Sci, Inst Geog Sci & Nat Resources Res, Key Lab Water Cycle & Related Land Surface Proc, Beijing 100101, Peoples R China; [Liu, Yong; Sang, Yan-Fang] Nanjing Hydraul Res Inst, State Key Lab Hydrol Water Resources & Hydraul En, Nanjing 210029, Jiangsu, Peoples R China; [Li, Xinxin] Univ Chinese Acad Sci, Beijing 100101, Peoples R China",,"Sang, YF (corresponding author), Chinese Acad Sci, Inst Geog Sci & Nat Resources Res, Key Lab Water Cycle & Related Land Surface Proc, Beijing 100101, Peoples R China.; Sang, YF (corresponding author), Nanjing Hydraul Res Inst, State Key Lab Hydrol Water Resources & Hydraul En, Nanjing 210029, Jiangsu, Peoples R China.",yongliu@nhri.cn; sangyf@igsnrr.ac.cn; inslixin@163.com; hujian_0629@sina.com; liangk@igsnrr.ac.cn,,,"National Natural Science Foundation of ChinaNational Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC) [91647110]; Bingwei Excellent Talents from the Institute of Geographic Sciences and Natural Resources Research, CAS; Youth Innovation Promotion Association CAS; Key Laboratory of Water Cycle and Related Land Surface Processes, Institute of Geographic Sciences and Natural Resources Research, Chinese Academy of Sciences [WL2015003]; Water Resources Public-welfare Project of China [Y515010, Y516012]","The authors gratefully acknowledged the most appropriate comments and suggestions given by the editors and the anonymous reviewers.

The baseline (1979-2005) regional climate of the MRB simulated by WRF agrees well with gridded observed climate data, ANUSPLIN of Environment Canada. Next, WRF projected the regional climate change of MRB for 2041-2100 by dynamic downscaling RCP4.5 and RCP8.5 climate scenarios of three global climate models (GCMs), ACCESS1-3, CCSM4, and CanESM2. Based on RCP4.5 and RCP8.5 climate scenarios downscaled by WRF, air temperature of MRB is projected to increase by 2.5-3.8 degrees C and 4.5-6.9 degrees C in the 2050 s and 2080 s, respectively. In general, the air temperature of MRB is projected to increase marginally higher in colder regions of higher latitude and elevation. In contrast, the seasonal precipitation of MRB is only projected to increase marginally in the 2080 s under the RCP4.5 and RCP8.5 scenarios, respectively. The projected extreme precipitation indices show that future precipitation events would become more intensive and of longer durations. Under both RCP4.5 and RCP8.5 climate scenarios, the annual counts of days with total precipitation exceeding 10 mm of MRB (R10mm) are projected to increase by 18% in 2041-2100; the maximum 5-day precipitation (Rx5day) could increase by 9.4%. More studies should be conducted to gain a better understanding of the potential impacts of global warming to MRB and possible adaptive measures to mitigate these impacts.","[Kuo, Chun-Chao; Gan, Thian Yew; Wang, Jingwen] Univ Alberta, Innovat Ctr Engn, Dept Civil & Environm Engn, 7-230 Donadeo,9211-116 St NW, Edmonton, AB T6G 1H9, Canada; [Kuo, Chun-Chao] Govt British Columbia, River Forecast Ctr, Nanaimo, BC, Canada",,"Gan, TY (corresponding author), Univ Alberta, Innovat Ctr Engn, Dept Civil & Environm Engn, 7-230 Donadeo,9211-116 St NW, Edmonton, AB T6G 1H9, Canada.",tgan@ualberta.ca,,,,,,69,2,2,2,12,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"ONE NEW YORK PLAZA, SUITE 4600, NEW YORK, NY, UNITED STATES",0930-7575,1432-0894,,CLIM DYNAM,Clim.

Besides, GW plays a crucial role in minimizing the impacts during extreme drought events. However, there is a fast decline in groundwater resources due to increased sectoral water demand compounded by reduced rainfall and rising temperature. Therefore, it is essential to develop appropriate tools to study spatio-temporal dynamics and predict groundwater levels to improve water resource management, especially during drought events. In this study, we applied machine learning algorithms based on support vector machines (SVMs), combined with data assimilation (DA) technique to predict the change in groundwater levels (CGWLs) at 1 to 3-month time scales for 46 GW wells located at the northeast United States. The in-situ climate variables and the Gravity Recovery and Climate Experiment (GRACE) mission-informed groundwater anomalies data (GWA) are used to develop the models. The results suggest that SVMs (SVM-DA) models forced with limited climate variables (i.e., precipitation, solar radiation, air temperature, infrared surface temperature) can forecast the CGWLs up to 3-month lead times at most of the locations. The addition of GRACE data as a forcing variable can improve the performance of SVMs at most of the stations, where a strong relationship exists between the CGWLs and the GWA. The SVM-DA model comparatively performed better than SVMs at most of the stations.","[Liu, Di; Yu, Zhongbo; Lu, Haishen] HoHai Univ, State Key Lab Hydrol Water Resources & Hydraul En, Nanjing 210098, Jiangsu, Peoples R China; [Liu, Di; Lu, Haishen; Li, Yajie] HoHai Univ, Coll Hydrol & Water Resources, Nanjing 210098, Jiangsu, Peoples R China; [Liu, Di; Yu, Zhongbo; Lu, Haishen] Joint Int Res Lab Global Change & Water Cycle, Nanjing 210098, Peoples R China; [Yu, Zhongbo] Hohai Univ, Yangtze Inst Conservat & Dev, Nanjing 210098, Jiangsu, Peoples R China; [Mishra, Ashok K.] Clemson Univ, Glenn Dept Civil Engn, 202 Lowry Hall, Clemson, SC 29634 USA",,"Yu, ZB (corresponding author), HoHai Univ, State Key Lab Hydrol Water Resources & Hydraul En, Nanjing 210098, Jiangsu, Peoples R China.; Mishra, AK (corresponding author), Clemson Univ, Glenn Dept Civil Engn, 202 Lowry Hall, Clemson, SC 29634 USA.",liudi@hhu.edu.cn; ashokm@g.clemson.edu; zyu@hhu.edu.cn; lvhaishen@hhu.edu.cn,"Mishra, ASHOK/AAE-1723-2022","Mishra, ASHOK/0000-0003-2606-4718","National Natural Science Foundation of ChinaNational Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC) [51709074, 51909058, 51539003, 41761134090, 41830752]; Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities of ChinaFundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities [B210202006]; National Key Research and Development Program of China [2016YFC0402710, 2018YFC0407704]; Special Fund of State Key Laboratory of Hydrology-Water Resources and Hydraulic Engineering [20195025612, 20195018812, 520004412]; NASA MEaSUREs Program","This study was supported by the National Natural Science Foundation of China (Grant No. 51709074, 51909058), the Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities of China (Grant No. B210202006), the National Key Research and Development Program of China (Grant No. 2016YFC0402710, 2018YFC0407704), and the National Natural Science Foundation of China (Grant No. 51539003, 41761134090, 41830752) and the Special Fund of State Key Laboratory of Hydrology-Water Resources and Hydraulic Engineering (Grant No.20195025612, 20195018812, 520004412).

Moreover, the flood in mountainous areas suddenly rises and falls, and the slope is steep. Thus, establishing a hydrological prediction model for small- and medium-sized rivers with high accuracy and different topographic features, that is, plains and mountains, is an urgent problem. A prediction method based on ASCS_LSTM_ATT is proposed to solve this problem. First, the important parameters are optimized by improving the cuckoo search algorithm. Second, different methods are used to determine the forecast factors according to various topographic features. Finally, the model is combined with the self-attention mechanism to extract significant information.

The discharges were estimated using climate variables from global climate models for two future growth scenarios: Representative Concentration Pathways 2.6 and 8.5. River channel dimensions were developed based on existing regional United States Geological Survey publications relating bankfull discharges with channel characteristics. Mathematic relationships for channel bankfull topwidth, depth, and side slope to contributing drainage area measured at model cross sections were developed. The proposed framework can be utilized at a national level to identify critical areas for flood risk assessment. Existing hydraulic models at these hot spots could be repurposed for near-real-time flood forecasting operations.

This paper introduces a multi-scale approach for modelling and forecasting private household water demand. Based on a household survey, the major driving factors for water demand can be identified and modelled on a micro scale. By using the method of up-scaling, the results then can be generalised and transferred to the level of communities. Finally, water demand can be simulated and forecasted on a regional level, such as a river catchment or the supply area of water utilities. In addition, this paper exemplifies the water demand modelling approach using a case study from Germany focusing on the micro scale.

Moving beyond the traditional river basin boundaries, large-scale hydrological models enable a coordinated, efficient, and harmonized anticipation and management of water-related risks (droughts, floods). However, the use of forecasts from such models at the river basin scale remains a challenge, depending on how the model reproduces the hydrological features of each particular river basin. Consequently, postprocessing of forecasts is a crucial step to ensure usefulness at the river basin scale. In this paper we present a methodology to postprocess seasonal streamflow forecasts from large-scale hydrological models and advance their quality for local applications. It consists of fuzzy logic systems that bias-adjust seasonal forecasts from a large-scale hydrological model by comparing its modeled streamflows with local observations. The methodology is demonstrated using forecasts from the pan-European hydrological model E-HYPE at the Jucar River basin (Spain). Fuzzy postprocessed forecasts are compared to postprocessed forecasts derived from a quantile mapping approach as a benchmark. Fuzzy postprocessing was able to provide skillful streamflow forecasts for the Jucar River basin, keeping most of the skill of raw E-HYPE forecasts and also outperforming quantile-mapping-based forecasts. The proposed methodology offers an efficient one-to-one mapping between large-scale modeled streamflows and basin-scale observations preserving its temporal dependence structure and can adapt its input set to increase the skill of postprocessed forecasts.","[Macian-Sorribes, Hector; Pulido-Velazquez, Manuel] Univ Politecn Valencia, Res Inst Water & Environm Engn IIAMA, Valencia, Spain; [Pechlivanidis, Ilias; Crochemore, Louise] Swedish Meteorol & Hydrol Inst, Hydrol Res Unit, Norrkoping, Sweden",,"Macian-Sorribes, H (corresponding author), Univ Politecn Valencia, Res Inst Water & Environm Engn IIAMA, Valencia, Spain.",hecmasor@upv.es,"Pechlivanidis, Ilias/AAC-6979-2019","Pechlivanidis, Ilias/0000-0002-3416-317X; Macian-Sorribes, Hector/0000-0003-4077-9955","EU Horizon 2020 programme under the IMPREX research and innovation project [641.811]; European Research Area for Climate Services programme (ER4CS) under the INNOVA project [690462]; ADAPTAMED project from the Ministerio de Ciencia, Innovacion Universidades (MICINN) of Spain [RTI2018-101483-B-I00]; Universitat Politecnica de Valencia [PAID 10-18]; EU Horizon 2020 project S2S4E (Sub -seasonal to Seasonal forecasting for the Energy sector) [776787]; EU Horizon 2020 project CLARA [730482]","This study was partially funded by the EU Horizon 2020 programme under the IMPREX research and innovation project (grant agreement no. 641.811), by the European Research Area for Climate Services programme (ER4CS) under the INNOVA project (Grant Agreement 690462), by the ADAPTAMED project (RTI2018-101483-B-I00) from the Ministerio de Ciencia, Innovacion Universidades (MICINN) of Spain, and by the postdoctoral program of Universitat Politecnica de Valencia (PAID 10-18).

Many streamflow prediction studies have demonstrated the excellent prediction ability of decomposition ensemble models. Several studies first extracted subsignals from a streamflow series and then split subsignals into training and validation sets to build prediction models, capturing some future information not available in practical streamflow forecasting. Alternatively, dividing a time series into training and validation sets first and later decomposing them into subsignals can expose the subsignals to the boundary effect, making predicting streamflow difficult. Furthermore, building one model for each subsignal is laborious and can cause error accumulation. Therefore, establishing a robust and efficient decomposition ensemble model without future information to predict highly nonstationary and nonlinear streamflow is challenging. Hence, a single-model forecasting (SF) scheme that assesses the validation distribution during the training stage to adapt to the boundary effect was designed. A SF scheme based on variational mode decomposition (VMD) and long short-term memory (LSTM), namely, SF-VMD-LSTM, was proposed to predict daily streamflow 1-7 days ahead. Non-decomposition-based and decomposition-ensemble-based LSTM models established using SF, multi-model ensemble forecasting (MEF) and SF with the most influential subsignals (SFMIS) and the ensemble empirical mode decomposition (EEMD) and discrete wavelet transform (DWT) were compared. Additionally, multi-model ensemble hindcasting (MEH), single-model hindcasting (SH) and SH with the most influential subsignals (SHMIS) were used as benchmarks to evaluate the forecasting schemes' adaptability to the boundary effect. Two daily streamflow series from Han River and Jing River, China, were investigated. The results indicate that (1) SF is more robust and efficient than MEF and SFMIS; (2) VMD performs better than EEMD and DWT; (3) SF-VMD-LSTM, with NSE values larger than 0.8 for almost all the prediction scenarios, outperformed other comparative models. Therefore, SF-VMD-LSTM is robust and efficient for forecasting highly nonstationary and nonlinear streamflow.","[Zuo, Ganggang; Luo, Jungang; Wang, Ni; Lian, Yani; He, Xinxin] Xian Univ Technol, State Key Lab Ecohydraul Northwest Arid Reg, Xian 710048, Shaanxi, Peoples R China",,"Luo, JG (corresponding author), Xian Univ Technol, State Key Lab Ecohydraul Northwest Arid Reg, Xian 710048, Shaanxi, Peoples R China.",jgluo@xaut.edu.cn; wangni@xaut.edu.cn; xinxinhe89@foxmail.com,"Zuo, Ganggang/AAL-3458-2021","Zuo, Ganggang/0000-0002-6364-3586","National Natural Science Foundation of ChinaNational Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC) [51679186, 51679188, 51979221, 51709222]; Research Fund of the State Key Laboratory of Eco-hydraulics in Northwest Arid Region, Xi'an University of Technology [2019KJCXTD-5]","This work was supported by the National Natural Science Foundation of China under Grant Nos. 51679186, 51679188, 51979221 and 51709222, and the Research Fund of the State Key Laboratory of Eco-hydraulics in Northwest Arid Region, Xi'an University of Technology under Grant No. 2019KJCXTD-5.

In this study, a spatially explicit statistical model framework was integrated with empirical stream temperature data (approximately four million bi-hourly recordings) and high-resolution climate and land surface data to estimate monthly stream temperatures and potential change under future climate scenarios in the Crown of the Continent Ecosystem, USA and Canada (72,000 km(2)). Moderate and extreme warming scenarios forecast increasing stream temperatures during spring, summer, and fall, with the largest increases predicted during summer (July, August, and September). Additionally, thermal regimes characteristic of current August temperatures, the warmest month of the year, may be exceeded during July and September, suggesting an earlier onset and extended duration of warm summer stream temperatures. Models estimate that the largest magnitude of temperature warming relative to current conditions may be observed during the shoulder months of winter (April and November). Summer stream temperature warming is likely to be most pronounced in glacial-fed streams where models predict the largest magnitude (> 50%) of change due to the loss of alpine glaciers. We provide the first broad-scale analysis of seasonal climate effects on spatiotemporal patterns of stream temperature in the Crown of the Continent Ecosystem for better understanding climate change impacts on freshwater habitats and guiding conservation and climate adaptation strategies.","[Jones, Leslie A.; Muhlfeld, Clint C.] US Geol Survey, Northern Rocky Mt Sci Ctr, West Glacier, MT 20192 USA; [Jones, Leslie A.] Univ Montana, Dept Biol Sci, Missoula, MT 59812 USA; [Jones, Leslie A.] Univ Alaska Achorage, Alaska Ctr Conservat Sci, Anchorage, AK 99508 USA; [Muhlfeld, Clint C.] Univ Montana, Flathead Lake Biol Stn, Polson, MT 59860 USA; [Marshall, Lucy A.] Univ New South Wales, Sch Civil & Environm Engn, Sydney, NSW, Australia",,"Jones, LA (corresponding author), US Geol Survey, Northern Rocky Mt Sci Ctr, West Glacier, MT 20192 USA.; Jones, LA (corresponding author), Univ Alaska Achorage, Alaska Ctr Conservat Sci, Anchorage, AK 99508 USA.",lajones12@alaska.edu; cmuhlfeld@usgs.gov; lucy.marshall@unsw.edu.au,,"Marshall, Lucy/0000-0003-0450-4292; Jones, Leslie/0000-0002-4953-7189","National Science FoundationNational Science Foundation (NSF) [DGE-1313190]; US Fish and Wildlife Services, Great Northern Landscape Conservation Cooperative; USGS Northern Rocky Mountain Science Center","This work was supported by the National Science Foundation under a Graduate Research Fellowship for L.

Previous flood risk assessments can barely take into account future changes of fine-scale hydroclimatic characteristics and hardly quantify multivariate interactions among flood variables, thereby resulting in an unreliable assessment of flood risk. In this study, for the first time, we develop probabilistic projections of multidimensional river flood risks at a convection-permitting scale through the Weather Research and Forecasting (WRF) climate simulations with 4-km horizontal grid spacing. Vine copula has been widely used to assess the multidimensional dependence structure of hydroclimate variables, but the commonly used frequentist approach may fail to identify the correct vine model and to obtain the uncertainty interval. Thus, a Bayesian vine copula approach is proposed to explicitly address the multidimensional dependence of flood characteristics (i.e., flood peak, volume, and duration) and underlying uncertainties. The proposed approach enables a robust assessment of return periods of future floods for Guadalupe and Mission river basins located in South Texas of the United States. Our findings reveal that the South Texas region is projected to experience more flood events with longer duration and greater discharge volume. The flood peak, however, will not necessarily increase even though precipitation extremes are expected to become more frequent. The projected flood return periods over the Guadalupe river basin do not show an obvious increase while the Mission river basin is projected to face a dramatic increase in flood risk with exposed to 100-year and even severer floods nearly every 2 years, on average, when considering the combined effects of flood peak, volume, and duration.","[Zhang, B.; Wang, S.] Hong Kong Polytech Univ, Dept Land Surveying & Geoinformat, Hong Kong, Peoples R China; [Wang, S.] Hong Kong Polytech Univ, Shenzhen Res Inst, Shenzhen, Peoples R China; [Wang, Y.] SUNY Coll Oswego, Dept Atmospher & Geol Sci, Oswego, NY 13126 USA",,"Wang, S (corresponding author), Hong Kong Polytech Univ, Dept Land Surveying & Geoinformat, Hong Kong, Peoples R China.; Wang, S (corresponding author), Hong Kong Polytech Univ, Shenzhen Res Inst, Shenzhen, Peoples R China.",shuo.s.wang@polyu.edu.hk,"Wang, Shuo/I-3017-2013","Wang, Shuo/0000-0001-7827-187X",National Natural Science Foundation of ChinaNational Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC) [51809223]; Hong Kong Research Grants Council Early Career Scheme [PP5Z],"This research was supported by the National Natural Science Foundation of China (Grant No. 51809223) and the Hong Kong Research Grants Council Early Career Scheme (Grant PP5Z).

Many studies have shown that ensemble flood forecasting based on numerical weather predictions can provide an early warning with extended lead time. However, the role of hydrological ensemble prediction in forecasting flood volume and its components over the Yarlung Zangbo River (YZR) basin, China, has not been investigated. This study adopts the variable infiltration capacity (VIC) model to forecast the annual maximum floods and annual first floods in the YZR based on precipitation and the maximum and minimum temperature from the European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts (ECMWF). N simulations are proposed to account for parameter uncertainty in VIC. Results show that when trade-offs between multiple objectives are significant, N simulations are recommended for better simulation and forecasting. This is why better results are obtained for the Nugesha and Yangcun stations. Our ensemble flood forecasting system can skillfully predict the maximum floods with a lead time of more than 10 d and can predict about 7 d ahead for meltwater-related components. The accuracy of forecasts for the first floods is inferior, with a lead time of only 5 d. The base-flow components for the first floods are insensitive to lead time, except at the Nuxia station, whilst for the maximum floods an obvious deterioration in performance with lead time can be recognized. The meltwater-induced surface runoff is the most poorly captured component by the forecast system, and the well-predicted rainfall-related components are the major contributor to good performance. The performance in 7 d accumulated flood volumes is better than the peak flows.","[Liu, Li; Xu, Yue Ping; Pan, Su Li; Bai, Zhi Xu] Zhejiang Univ, Inst Hydrol & Water Resources Civil Engn & Archit, Hangzhou 310058, Zhejiang, Peoples R China",,"Xu, YP (corresponding author), Zhejiang Univ, Inst Hydrol & Water Resources Civil Engn & Archit, Hangzhou 310058, Zhejiang, Peoples R China.",yuepingxu@zju.edu.cn,"Xu, Yueping/C-2934-2014",,National Natural Science Foundation of ChinaNational Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC) [91547106]; National Key Research and Development Plan Intergovernmental Cooperation in International Scientific and Technological Innovation [2016YFE0122100],This research has been supported by the National Natural Science Foundation of China (grant no. 91547106) and the National Key Research and Development Plan Intergovernmental Cooperation in International Scientific and Technological Innovation (grant no. 2016YFE0122100).,,90,13,14,5,14,COPERNICUS GESELLSCHAFT MBH,GOTTINGEN,"BAHNHOFSALLEE 1E, GOTTINGEN, 37081, GERMANY",1027-5606,1607-7938,,HYDROL EARTH SYST SC,Hydrol.

The proposed approach eliminates the bias resulting from predefined indices at regional scale. The study was performed for eight unimpaired streamflow stations from 1962-2016. First, the Singular Valued Decomposition (SVD) teleconnections of the streamflow corresponding to 500 mbar geopotential height, sea surface temperature, 500 mbar specific humidity (SHUM500), and 500 mbar U-wind (U-500) were obtained. Second, the skillful SVD teleconnections were screened non-parametrically. Finally, the screened teleconnections were used as the streamflow predictors in the non-linear regression models (K-nearest neighbor regression and data-driven support vector machine). New hydrological insights: The SVD results identified new spatial regions that have not been included in existing predefined indices. The nonparametric model indicated the teleconnections of SHUM500 and U-500 being better streamflow predictors compared to other climate variables. The regression models were capable to apprehend most of the sustained low flows, proving the model to be effective for drought-affected regions. It was also observed that the proposed approach showed better forecasting skills with preprocessed large scale climate variables rather than using the predefined indices. The proposed study is simple, yet robust in providing qualitative streamflow forecasts that may assist water managers in making policy-related decisions when planning and managing watersheds.","[Thakur, Balbhadra; Kalra, Ajay] Southern Illinois Univ, Dept Civil & Environm Engn, 1230 Lincoln Dr, Carbondale, IL 62901 USA; [Ahmad, Sajjad] Univ Nevada, Dept Civil & Environm Engn & Construct, Las Vegas, NV 89154 USA; [Lamb, Kenneth W.] Calif State Polytech Univ Pomona, Dept Civil Engn, Pomona, CA 91768 USA; [Lakshmi, Venkat] Univ Virginia, Dept Engn Syst & Environm, Charlottesville, VA USA",,"Kalra, A (corresponding author), Southern Illinois Univ, Dept Civil & Environm Engn, 1230 Lincoln Dr, Carbondale, IL 62901 USA.",kalraa@siu.edu,"Ahmad, Sajjad/A-2867-2008","Ahmad, Sajjad/0000-0002-9903-9321; Kalra, Ajay/0000-0003-3878-2346",Office of the Vice Chancellor for Research at Southern Illinois University Carbondale,The authors acknowledge the valuable comments provided by reviewers that helped in improving the overall quality of the manuscript.

Similarly, ANN tools have the ability to evaluate historical data collected from different river stations and wastewater treatment plants with minimum errors within a short time. Therefore, based on the selected past literature used for this review we found that different types of ANN algorithm such as feed-forward backpropagation (FFBP) algorithm, gradient descent, Broyden-Fletcher-Goldfarb-Shanno (BFGS), conjugate gradient, radial basis function neural networks (RBFNN), neural network fitting (NNF), cascade forward back propagation (CFBP), ensemble ANN (EANN) and single AAN (SANN) have been employed in the prediction and monitoring of water quality parameters with satisfactory outcome.

Algae converts CO2, nitrates, phosphates and other nutrients into a biomass that can be processed into biofuels, pharmaceuticals, nutraceuticals, food, fertilizers, and other active compounds. Solar irradiance and media temperatures are key parameters in determining microalgae cultivation yield and hence these parameters are fundamental in existing models that have been constructed to predict yields in different locations for open pond raceway (OPR) cultivation systems. The challenge in estimating OPR yields in higher and lower latitudes (colder climates) is that there are no known attempts to cultivate algae at any scale in these regions, nor are there data sets that include shallow pond site-specific daily water temperature measurements, from which to construct algae cultivation models. To address these challenges, our research introduces a new data-intensive analytical SATOPR (SATellite Open Pond Raceway) model, relying on ubiquitous historical satellite data. Local solar irradiance and ambient temperature values which are used to predict microalgae production yields at any geographic location including the colder latitudes of central Alberta and the Northwest Territories in Canada. The model predicts that annual open pond algae cultivation to produce 1000 T biomass would require 17-20 ha at Mesa, AZ, 45-56 ha at Medicine Hat, AB, 57-68 ha at Fort Saskatchewan, AB and 71-80 ha at Great Slave Lake, NWT. The Mesa, AZ results are more conservative than forecast by a NREL model predicting 12 ha to produce 1000 T biomass.

Our study reveals that while forecasts evaluated over the full flow range can appear reliable, stratification into high/low flow ranges highlights significant under/over-estimation of forecast uncertainty, respectively. We overcome this challenge by introducing a flow-dependent (FD) nonparametric component into a post-processing model of hydrological forecasting errors, the Multi-Temporal Hydrological Residual Error (MuTHRE) model, yielding the MuTHRE-FD model.

Through its improved treatment of flow-dependence, the MuTHRE-FD model achieves practically significant improvements over the original MuTHRE model in the reliability of forecasted cumulative volumes for: (a) high flows out to 7 days; (b) low flows out to 2 days; and (c) mid flows for majority of lead times. The new MuTHRE-FD model provides seamless sub-seasonal forecasts with high quality performance for both high and low flows over a range of lead times. This improvement provides forecast users with increased confidence in using sub-seasonal forecasts across a wide range of applications.","[McInerney, David; Thyer, Mark; Kavetski, Dmitri] Univ Adelaide, Sch Civil Environm & Min Engn, Adelaide, SA, Australia; [Laugesen, Richard; Tuteja, Narendra] Bur Meteorol, Canberra, ACT, Australia; [Woldemeskel, Fitsum] Bur Meteorol, Melbourne, Vic, Australia; [Kuczera, George] Univ Newcastle, Sch Engn, Callaghan, NSW, Australia",,"McInerney, D (corresponding author), Univ Adelaide, Sch Civil Environm & Min Engn, Adelaide, SA, Australia.",David.Mcinerney@adelaide.edu.au,"McInerney, David/I-4896-2015","McInerney, David/0000-0003-4876-8281; Laugesen, Richard/0000-0002-3811-5845",Australian Bureau of Meteorology,"This work was funded by the Australian Bureau of Meteorology.

Here, we propose a forecast-informed framework to derive multiobjective operating rules based on radial basis functions and the Pareto archived dynamically dimensioned search optimization algorithm and subsequently develop indicators reflective of Pareto fronts with and without forecast information to characterize forecast value. Based on a case study of the Hanjiang cascade of reservoirs in the Yangtze River Basin, China, the optimal inclusion of streamflow forecasts notably improves the performance of multiobjective reservoir operations, mainly by significantly increasing the hydropower generation. The relationship between forecast accuracy and value is explored by comparing four accuracy indicators (Nash-Sutcliffe efficiency, mutual information, correlation coefficient, and Kullback-Leibler distance) and forecast value. The correlation coefficient is found to be the most suitable forecast indicator given its high correlation with forecast value and stability in the regression. For multiobjective forecast-informed reservoir systems, it is critical to understand and define the relationship between forecast accuracy and forecast value; if improvements in accuracy lead to steep gains in value, investing in further forecast model development may be warranted.","[Yang, Guang; Guo, Shenglian; Liu, Pan] Wuhan Univ, Sch Water Resources & Hydropower Engn, Wuhan 430072, Hubei, Peoples R China; [Yang, Guang; Block, Paul] Univ Wisconsin, Dept Civil & Environm Engn, Madison, WI 53706 USA; [Guo, Shenglian] Wuhan Univ, State Key Lab Water Resources & Hydropower Engn S, Wuhan 430072, Hubei, Peoples R China",,"Guo, SL (corresponding author), Wuhan Univ, Sch Water Resources & Hydropower Engn, Wuhan 430072, Hubei, Peoples R China.; Guo, SL (corresponding author), Wuhan Univ, State Key Lab Water Resources & Hydropower Engn S, Wuhan 430072, Hubei, Peoples R China.",yang_guang@whu.edu.cn; slguo@whu.edu.cn,,"Yang, Guang/0000-0001-7330-3502","National Natural Science Foundation of ChinaNational Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC) [51539009, 51879192]",This study was financially supported by the National Natural Science Foundation of China (Grant Nos. 51539009 and 51879192).,,52,6,6,5,33,ASCE-AMER SOC CIVIL ENGINEERS,RESTON,"1801 ALEXANDER BELL DR, RESTON, VA 20191-4400 USA",0733-9496,1943-5452,,J WATER RES PLAN MAN,J.

To evaluate the effectiveness of alternative data-driven and process-based methods, flow forecasts at a case study site (River Dove, UK) using (1) a probability-distributed rainfall-runoff model (PDM), (2) PDM coupled with an autoregressive integrated moving average (ARIMA) error predictor, and (3) a long short-term memory (LSTM) neural network are integrated into a water resources management model coupled with genetic algorithm optimization to simulate and compare water abstractions, reservoir storage, downstream river flows, and pumping energy costs. When compared to historical data, results show that both PDM plus ARIMA and LSTM forecasts led to improved water abstraction operations, i.e., increased water abstraction volumes during dry periods while maintaining river environmental flows, as well as reduced pumping costs. Cost savings were found to be sensitive to the accuracy of the forecasting technique only within specific flow ranges. This study demonstrates the water resource benefits of real-time flow forecasting in supporting flexible water pumping schedules and further discusses the benefits of alternative modeling approaches in the specific context of controlling water abstraction.","[Yassin, Mohammed; Speight, Vanessa; Shucksmith, James D.] Univ Sheffield, Sheffield Water Ctr, Dept Civil & Struct Engn, Sheffield S1 3JD, S Yorkshire, England; [Asfaw, Alemayehu] Severn Trent Water Ltd, Severn Trent Water Ctr, POB 5309, Coventry CV3 9FH, W Midlands, England",,"Yassin, M (corresponding author), Univ Sheffield, Sheffield Water Ctr, Dept Civil & Struct Engn, Sheffield S1 3JD, S Yorkshire, England.",m.yassin@sheffield.ac.uk,,"Yassin, Mohammed/0000-0001-8854-4018",Innovate UKUK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Innovate UK; Engineering and Physical Sciences Research CouncilUK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Engineering & Physical Sciences Research Council (EPSRC),"This work was delivered through a Knowledge Transfer Partnership (KTP) project cofunded by Innovate UK and the Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council.

Three typical sites with different landscapes and topsoil profiles were chosen for the field study. Field work consisted of pit development and soil sample collection for laboratory study using the centrifuge method. Soil hydraulic parameters were obtained by the RETC code using the observed values of volumetric water content vs. pressure head. HYDRUS-1D code was used to estimate groundwater recharge based on a 70-year (1945-2015) meteorological dataset with daily resolution (including values of precipitation, air temperature, wind speed, and humidity). This dataset was preprocessed using our SURFBAL code to calculate the surface and topsoil water and energy balance. Retrospective historical simulation results showed that there was a considerable variation in the mean annual groundwater recharge values (49-104 mm/year) for the three studied profiles. The temporal change in groundwater recharge occurred relatively synchronously at all sites and was governed by the change in the current annual aridity index. The results of this historical simulation did not reveal any traces of climate change in the groundwater recharge of the studied region in the last 30-40 years. To predict the recharge variations in the second half of the 21st century, the LARSWG forecast weather generator with the climate projections of the 5th General Circulation Models (GCMs) from the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project 5 (CMIP5) family was used. On average in the case of climate development under the maximum greenhouse gas emissions RCP8.5 scenario, there will be a reduction in groundwater recharge in the studied region in 2060-2080, caused by two factors: change of aridity index, which determines evapotranspiration during a warm season and the accumulation of snow and subsequent meltwater infiltration during the snowmelt periods.","[Pozdniakov, Sergey P.; Vasilevsky, Peter Yu; Grinevskiy, Sergey O.; Lekhov, Vladimir A.; Sizov, Nikolay E.] Lomonosov Moscow State Univ, Dept Hydrogeol, GSP 1, Moscow 119899, Russia; [Wang, Ping] Chinese Acad Sci, Inst Geog Sci & Nat Resources Res, Key Lab Water Cycle & Related Land Surface Proc, 11A Datun Rd, Beijing 100101, Peoples R China",,"Vasilevsky, PY (corresponding author), Lomonosov Moscow State Univ, Dept Hydrogeol, GSP 1, Moscow 119899, Russia.",valenciacf@mail.ru,", Ping/AAB-4575-2019; Поздняков, Сергей/AAS-6432-2020",", Ping/0000-0003-2481-9953; Поздняков, Сергей/0000-0002-2932-4565",Russian Science FoundationRussian Science Foundation (RSF) [16-17-10187]; Special Exchange Program of the Chinese Academy of Sciences [2019-2020],"These investigations were supported by the Russian Science Foundation No. 16-17-10187.

The water coming from Himalayan rivers is essential for 1.4 billion people living downstream. Earlier studies either modeled temperature or rainfall for the Himalayan area; however, the combined influence of both in a long-term analysis was not performed utilizing Deep Learning (DL). The present investigation attempted to analyze the time series and correlation of temperature (1796-2013) and rainfall changes (1901-2015) over the Himalayan states in India. The Climate Deep Long Short-Term Memory (CDLSTM) model was developed and optimized to forecast all Himalayan states' temperature and rainfall values.

However, the growing demand for groundwater must meet the needs of an enormous community to sustain the severe effects of limited water resources. Therefore, the groundwater level (GWL) should be analyzed for efficient groundwater management to identify groundwater usages. However, predicting the GWL is a challenging task in water resource management because of large complex data. So, this research has proposed generalized intelligence control with hybrid ant colony African buffalo optimization (GIC with HAC-ABO) approach to forecast the GWL in alluvial aquifers at Varanasi City. Initially, the well locations at Varanasi, Uttar Pradesh, are identified with the use of differential global positioning system (DGPS). Subsequently, the GWL in the well for post-monsoon and pre-monsoon is measured using a graduated steel tape. Then the fitness value of HAC-ABO in GIC was updated to predict the GWL in Varanasi wells. Here, the proposed technique has analyzed the GWL for both pre-monsoon and post-monsoon for every year and also predicts the future GWL in Varanasi well after 30 years. Henceforth, this approach has provided better results in the grounds of prediction accuracy, correlation coefficient, root mean square error (RMSE), and mean absolute error (MAE) compared to other approaches.","[Shekhar, Shiwanshu; Jha, Medha] BHU, Dept Civil Engn, Indian Inst Technol, Varanasi 221005, Uttar Pradesh, India",,"Shekhar, S (corresponding author), BHU, Dept Civil Engn, Indian Inst Technol, Varanasi 221005, Uttar Pradesh, India.",shiwanshu.rs.civ14@itbhu.ac.in; mjha.civ@itbhu.ac.in,,,,,,53,0,0,1,1,SPRINGER HEIDELBERG,HEIDELBERG,"TIERGARTENSTRASSE 17, D-69121 HEIDELBERG, GERMANY",1866-7511,1866-7538,,ARAB J GEOSCI,Arab.

Water managers may not use climate forecasts to their full potential due to perceived low skill, mismatched spatial and temporal resolutions, or lack of knowledge or tools to ingest data. Most forecasts are disseminated as large-domain maps or gridded datasets and may be systematically biased relative to watershed climatologies. Forecasts presented on a watershed scale allow water managers to view forecasts for their specific basins, thereby increasing the usability and relevance of climate forecasts. This paper describes the formulation of S2S climate forecast products based on the Climate Forecast System version 2 (CFSv2) and the North American Multi-Model Ensemble (NMME). Forecast products include bi-weekly CFSv2 forecasts, and monthly and seasonal NMME forecasts. Precipitation and temperature forecasts are aggregated spatially to a United States Geological Survey (USGS) hydrologic unit code 4 (HUC-4) watershed scale. Forecast verification reveals appreciable skill in the first two bi-weekly periods (Weeks 1-2 and 2-3) from CFSv2, and usable skill in NMME Month 1 forecast with varying skills at longer lead times dependent on the season. Application of a bias-correction technique (quantile mapping) eliminates forecast bias in the CFSv2 reforecasts, without adding significantly to correlation skill.","[Baker, Sarah A.; Rajagopalan, Balaji] Univ Colorado Boulder, Dept Civil Environm & Architectural Engn, Boulder, CO 80309 USA; [Wood, Andrew W.] Natl Ctr Atmospher Res, Res Applicat Lab, POB 3000, Boulder, CO 80307 USA",,"Baker, SA (corresponding author), Univ Colorado Boulder, Dept Civil Environm & Architectural Engn, Boulder, CO 80309 USA.",sarah.a.baker@colorado.edu,,,,,,43,12,12,6,18,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",1093-474X,1752-1688,,J AM WATER RESOUR AS,J.

This study focuses on the management of the Yuvacik Dam Reservoir for water supply and flood mitigation in the Marmara Region of Turkey. We present an improved operating technique for fulfilling the conflicting water supply and flood mitigation objectives. This is accomplished by incorporating the long term water supply objectives into a Guide Curve (GC) whereas the extreme floods are attenuated by means of short-term optimization based on Model Predictive Control (MPC). The reference case implements operating rules with a constant GC at maximum forebay elevation targeting the fulfillment of the water supply objective. We compare the reference with a new time-dependent GC, derived using an Implicit Stochastic Optimization (ISO) approach. This new curve shows nearly the same performance regarding the water supply objectives, but significantly reduces the flooding risk downstream of the dam. Possible flood events observed at the end of the wet season, when the reservoir is at the maximum level to enable water supply for the dry season, can be eliminated by the application of an additional short-term optimization by MPC. The robustness of the approach is demonstrated via hindcasting experiments.","[Uysal, Goekcen; Schwanenberg, Dirk; Alvarado-Montero, Rodolfo] Univ Duisburg Essen, Inst Hydraul Engn & Water Resources Management, Dept Civil Engn, D-45141 Essen, Germany; [Uysal, Goekcen; Sensoy, Aynur] Anadolu Univ, Dept Civil Engn, TR-26555 Eskisehir, Turkey; [Schwanenberg, Dirk] KISTERS AG, D-52076 Aachen, Germany",,"Uysal, G (corresponding author), Univ Duisburg Essen, Inst Hydraul Engn & Water Resources Management, Dept Civil Engn, D-45141 Essen, Germany.",gokcenuysal@gmail.com,"Sensoy, Aynur/E-6040-2019","Sensoy, Aynur/0000-0003-3004-4912",Scientific and Technological Research Council of Turkey (TUBITAK)Turkiye Bilimsel ve Teknolojik Arastirma Kurumu (TUBITAK) [2214A]; Anadolu UniversityAnadolu University [BAP-1506F502]; TUBITAKTurkiye Bilimsel ve Teknolojik Arastirma Kurumu (TUBITAK) [109Y218],The first author would like to thank The Scientific and Technological Research Council of Turkey (TUBITAK) for the scholarship (2214A program).

The observed weather data were fed to the hydrological model, and the synthetic streamflow subsequently generated was considered to be a proxy for the observed inflow. A traditional, climatology-based ESP forecast approach was used to generate ensemble streamflow scenarios, which were used by three reservoir management optimization approaches. Both positive and negative biases were then forced into the ensembles by multiplying the streamflow values by constant factors. The optimization method's response to those biases was measured through the evaluation of the average annual energy generation in a forward-rolling simulation test bed in which the entire system is precisely and accurately modelled. The ensemble climate data forecasts, the hydrological modelling and ESP forecast generation, optimization model, and decision-making process are all integrated, as is the simulation model that updates reservoir levels and computes generation at each time step. The study focussed on one hydropower system both with and without minimum baseload constraints. This study finds that the tested deterministic optimization algorithms lack the capacity to compensate for uncertainty in future inflows and therefore place the reservoir levels at greater risk to maximize short-term profit. It is shown that for this particular system, an increase in ESP forecast inflows of approximately 5% allows managing the reservoirs at optimal levels and producing the most energy on average, effectively negating the deterministic model's tendency to underestimate the risk of spilling. Finally, it is shown that implementing minimum load constraints serves as a de facto control on deterministic bias by forcing the system to draw more water from the reservoirs than what the models consider to be optimal trajectories.","[Arsenault, Richard] Ecole Technol Super, Dept Construct Engn, Montreal, PQ H3C 1K3, Canada; [Arsenault, Richard; Cote, Pascal] Rio Tinto, Quebec Power Operat, Jonquiere, PQ G7S 4R5, Canada",,"Arsenault, R (corresponding author), Ecole Technol Super, Dept Construct Engn, Montreal, PQ H3C 1K3, Canada.; Arsenault, R (corresponding author), Rio Tinto, Quebec Power Operat, Jonquiere, PQ G7S 4R5, Canada.",richard.arsenault@etsmtl.ca,,"Arsenault, Richard/0000-0003-2834-2750",,,,43,9,9,3,5,COPERNICUS GESELLSCHAFT MBH,GOTTINGEN,"BAHNHOFSALLEE 1E, GOTTINGEN, 37081, GERMANY",1027-5606,1607-7938,,HYDROL EARTH SYST SC,Hydrol.

The Gharasou River is the primary resource of water supply for the Karkheh River Basin (KRB), the third-greatest and most productive basin in Iran. This paper reviewed the estimation of water quality of the Gharasou River by W-ANN, QUAL2K, MPSIAC, WEPP, SWAT, SRM, AWBM, HBV, SDSM, and ANN models. The results of the QUAL2K simulation showed the rapid increases of BOD, TN, and TP in the Sahra Company site. The SRM and AWBM could simulate monthly runoff. The results also showed that the SWAT model simulated monthly runoff reasonably in some studies but weakly in another. Results indicated that W-ANN could estimate accurately EC (r = 0.996) and TDS (r = 0.999). The HBV model could simulate ETa reasonably in the KRB. The MPSIAC model estimated the erosion rates of 4.47, 16.60, and 18.57 t ha(-1) yr(-1)in the agriculture area, rangeland, and forest, respectively. The WEPP model predicted the runoff accurately especially in the slope of 25%, but under-estimated soil erosion in the slopes of 35% and 45%. SDSM and ANN models showed a significant reduction of streamflow of - 3.7 and - 9.47 m(3) s(-1), respectively. While these models predict + 0.58 and + 0.48 degrees C increases in temperature, they forecast - 0.1 and - 0.4 mm decreases in daily rainfall, respectively.

Ensemble streamflow prediction (ESP) is a well-established method for generating an ensemble of streamflow forecasts in the absence of skilful future meteorological predictions, instead using initial hydrologic conditions (IHCs), such as soil moisture, groundwater, and snow, as the source of skill. We benchmark when and where the ESP method is skilful across a diverse sample of 314 catchments in the UK and explore the relationship between catchment storage and ESP skill. The GR4J hydrological model was forced with historic climate sequences to produce a 51-member ensemble of streamflow hindcasts. We evaluated forecast skill seamlessly from lead times of 1 day to 12 months initialized at the first of each month over a 50-year hindcast period from 1965 to 2015. Results showed ESP was skilful against a climatology benchmark forecast in the majority of catchments across all lead times up to a year ahead, but the degree of skill was strongly conditional on lead time, forecast initialization month, and individual catchment location and storage properties. UK- wide mean ESP skill decayed exponentially as a function of lead time with continuous ranked probability skill scores across the year of 0.75, 0.20, and 0.11 for 1-day, 1-month, and 3-month lead times, respectively. However, skill was not uniform across all initialization months. For lead times up to 1 month, ESP skill was higher than average when initialized in summer and lower in winter months, whereas for longer seasonal and annual lead times skill was higher when initialized in autumn and winter months and lowest in spring. ESP was most skilful in the south and east of the UK, where slower responding catchments with higher soil moisture and groundwater storage are mainly located; correlation between catchment base flow index (BFI) and ESP skill was very strong (Spearman's rank correlation coefficient = 0.90 at 1-month lead time). This was in contrast to the more highly responsive catchments in the north and west which were generally not skilful at seasonal lead times. Overall, this work provides scientific justification for when and where use of such a relatively simple forecasting approach is appropriate in the UK. This study, furthermore, creates a low cost benchmark against which potential skill improvements from more sophisticated hydro-meteorological ensemble prediction systems can be judged.","[Harrigan, Shaun; Prudhomme, Christel] European Ctr Medium Range Weather Forecasts ECMWF, Shinfield Pk, Reading RG2 9AX, Berks, England; [Harrigan, Shaun; Prudhomme, Christel; Parry, Simon; Smith, Katie; Tanguy, Maliko] Ctr Ecol & Hydrol, Wallingford OX10 8BB, Oxon, England; [Prudhomme, Christel] Loughborough Univ Technol, Dept Geog, Loughborough LE11 3TU, Leics, England",,"Harrigan, S (corresponding author), European Ctr Medium Range Weather Forecasts ECMWF, Shinfield Pk, Reading RG2 9AX, Berks, England.; Harrigan, S (corresponding author), Ctr Ecol & Hydrol, Wallingford OX10 8BB, Oxon, England.",shaun.harrigan@ecmwf.int,"Harrigan, Shaun/X-5048-2019; Tanguy, Maliko/AAL-3675-2021; Prudhomme, Christel/K-2669-2012","Harrigan, Shaun/0000-0002-0992-3667; Tanguy, Maliko/0000-0002-1516-6834; Prudhomme, Christel/0000-0003-1722-2497; Parry, Simon/0000-0002-7057-4195; Facer-Childs, Katie/0000-0003-1060-9103",NERC National Capability funding; NERC funded Improving Predictions of Drought for User Decision-Making (IMPETUS) project [NE/L010267/1]; NERCUK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Natural Environment Research Council (NERC) [NE/L010267/1] Funding Source: UKRI,"This work was funded by NERC National Capability funding to CEH and the NERC funded Improving Predictions of Drought for User Decision-Making (IMPETUS) project (NE/L010267/1).

Such systems make the most of rainfall forecast information, to release water prior to storm events and thus minimize uncontrolled overflows. To date, most advanced applications have adopted 24-hr forecast information, leaving longer-term forecasts largely untested. In this study, we aimed to predict the performance of four different RTC strategies, based on different forecast lead time and preferred objectives. RTC systems were predicted to yield comparatively less harvested rainwater than conventional passive systems but delivered superior performance in terms of flood mitigation and delivery of environmental water for streamflow restoration. More importantly, using a 7-day rainfall forecast was shown to enhance the ability of RTC in mitigating flood risks and delivering an outflow regime that is close to the natural (reference) streamflow. Such a finding suggests that RTC combined with 7-day forecast can enhance the functionality of rainwater harvesting systems to restore and even mimic the entire natural flow regimes in receiving streams. This also opens up a new opportunity for practitioners to implement smart technology in managing urban stormwater in a range of contexts and for a range of stream health objectives.","[Xu, Wei D.; Fletcher, Tim D.; Burns, Matthew J.; Cherqui, Frederic] Univ Melbourne, Sch Ecosyst & Forest Sci, Melbourne, Vic, Australia; [Cherqui, Frederic] Univ Lyon, INSA Lyon, Villeurbanne, France",,"Xu, WD (corresponding author), Univ Melbourne, Sch Ecosyst & Forest Sci, Melbourne, Vic, Australia.",danielweixu@gmail.com,"Cherqui, Frederic/AAJ-5281-2020; Fletcher, Tim/AAB-8356-2019","Cherqui, Frederic/0000-0001-8836-3970; Xu, Wei/0000-0002-1705-7383; Fletcher, Tim/0000-0001-8819-5567; Burns, Matthew/0000-0002-2273-8925","Melbourne Water, through the Melbourne Waterway Research-Practice Partnership; European UnionEuropean Commission [786566]; University of MelbourneUniversity of Melbourne; South East Water Corporation","This research was made possible by the financial support from Melbourne Water, through the Melbourne Waterway Research-Practice Partnership (http://mwrpp.org) and from the European Union's Horizon 2020 research and innovation program under Grant Agreement 786566 (https://mind4stormwater.org).Wei D.

However, the effects of climate change on such ecosystems have rarely been quantitatively addressed. We propose a methodology to evaluate the thermal response of small, shallow lakes to long-term changes in the meteorological conditions through model simulations. To do so, a 3D thermal-hydrodynamic model is forced with meteorological data and used to hindcast the evolution of an urban lake in the Paris region between 1960 and 2017. Its thermal response is assessed through a series of indices describing its thermal regime in terms of water temperature, thermal stratification, and potential cyanobacteria production. These indices and the meteorological forcing are first analysed over time to test the presence of long-term monotonic trends. 3D simulations are then exploited to highlight the presence of spatial heterogeneity. The analyses show that climate change has strongly impacted the thermal regime of the study site. Its response is highly correlated with three meteorological variables: air temperature, solar radiation, and wind speed. Mean annual water temperature shows a considerable warming trend of 0.6 degrees C per decade, accompanied by longer stratification and by an increase in thermal energy favourable to cyanobacteria proliferation. The strengthening of thermal conditions favourable for cyanobacteria is particularly strong during spring and summer, while stratification increases especially during spring and autumn. The 3D analysis allows us to detect a sharp separation between deeper and shallower portions of the basin in terms of stratification dynamics and potential cyanobacteria production. This induces highly dynamic patterns in space and time within the study site that are particularly favourable to cyanobacteria growth and bloom initiation.","[Piccioni, Francesco; Lemaire, Bruno Jacques; Dubois, Philippe; Vincon-Leite, Brigitte] Univ Paris Est Creteil, Ecole Ponts ParisTech, LEESU, Marne La Vallee, France; [Casenave, Celine] Univ Montpellier, Inst Agro, INRAE, MISTEA, Montpellier, France; [Lemaire, Bruno Jacques] AgroParisTech, Paris, France; [Le Moigne, Patrick] Univ Toulouse, CNRS, Meteo France, CNRM, Toulouse, France",,"Piccioni, F; Vincon-Leite, B (corresponding author), Univ Paris Est Creteil, Ecole Ponts ParisTech, LEESU, Marne La Vallee, France.",francesco.piccioni@enpc.fr; b.vincon-leite@enpc.fr,"Le+Moigne, Patrick/AAU-9622-2020",,OSSCyano project [ANR-13-ECOT-0001]; ANSWER project [ANR-16-CE32-0009-02]; OSU EFLUVE; OLA; Ecole des Ponts ParisTech; ANSWER project,The dataset used for model calibration and validation was collected under the OSSCyano (ANR-13-ECOT-0001) and ANSWER (ANR-16-CE32-0009-02) projects.

The numerical model introduced in this study turns governing differential equations into systems of linear or non-linear equations in the flow field, thereby revealing solutions. This one-dimensional hydrodynamic model represents the varied unsteady flow found in natural channels based on the Saint-Venant Equations. The model consists of the equations for the conservation of mass and momentum, which are recognized as very powerful mathematical tools for studying an important class of water resource problems. These problems are characterized by time dependence of flow and cover a wide range of phenomena. The formulations, held up by the four-point implicit finite difference scheme, solve the nonlinear system of equations using the Newton-Raphson iteration method with a modified Gaussian elimination technique. The model is calibrated using data on the Euphrates River during the early spring flood in 2015. It is verified by its application to an ideal canal and to the reach selected at the Euphrates River; this application is also used to predict the effect of hydraulic parameters on the river's flow characteristics. A comparison between model results and field data indicates the feasibility of our technique and the accuracy of results (R-2 = 0.997), meaning that the model is ready for future application whenever field observations are available.","[Al-Mansori, Nassrin Jassim Hussien; Al-Zubaidi, Laith Shaker Ashoor] Univ Babylon, Dept Environm Engn, Babylon 00964, Iraq",,"Al-Mansori, NJH (corresponding author), Univ Babylon, Dept Environm Engn, Babylon 00964, Iraq.",nassrin20052001@yahoo.com,J.AL-Mansori/AAM-1966-2021,,,,,27,4,4,1,2,C EJ PUBLISHING GROUP,TEHRAN,"DR KAVIANPOUR OFF, 3RD FL CIVIL ENGINEERING FAC, K N TOOSI UNIV TECHNOLOGY, TEHRAN, 00000, IRAN",2676-6957,2476-3055,,CIV ENG J-TEHRAN,"Civ.

To generate the multimodel ensembles, we implement a new statistical postprocessor, namely, quantile regression-Bayesian model averaging (QR-BMA). Quantile regression-Bayesian model averaging uses quantile regression to bias correct the ensemble streamflow forecasts from the individual models and Bayesian model averaging to optimally combine their probability density functions. Additionally, we use an information-theoretic measure, namely, conditional mutual information, to quantify the skill enhancements from the multimodel forecasts. We generate ensemble streamflow forecasts at lead times from 1 to 7days using three hydrological models: (i) Antecedent Precipitation Index-Continuous, (ii) Hydrology Laboratory-Research Distributed Hydrologic Model, and (iii) Weather Research and Forecasting Hydrological modeling system. As forcing to the hydrological models, we use weather ensemble forecasts from the National Centers for Environmental Prediction 11-member Global Ensemble Forecast System Reforecast version 2. The forecasting experiments are performed for four nested basins of the North Branch Susquehanna River, USA. We find that after bias correcting the streamflow forecasts from each model, their skill performance becomes comparable. We find that the multimodel ensemble forecasts have higher skill than the best single-model forecasts. Furthermore, the skill enhancements obtained by the multimodel ensemble forecasts are found to be dominated by model diversity, rather than by increased ensemble size alone. This result, obtained using conditional mutual information, indicates that each hydrological model contributes additional information to enhance forecast skill.

Study focus: Andean watersheds are important providers of water supply for human consumption, food supply, energy generation, industrial water use, and ecosystem services and functions for many cities in Ecuador and in the rest of South America. In these regions, accurate quantification and prediction of water flow is challenging, mainly due to significant climatic variability and sparse monitoring networks. In the context of flow forecasting, this work evaluates the accuracy of two physical models (WEAP and GR2M) and two models based on artificial neural networks (ANN) that use meteorological data as input variables. Then, a hybrid technique is proposed, using the time series generated by the individual models as inputs of a new ANN. This approach aims to increase the accuracy of the simulated flow by combining and exploiting the information provided by physical and data-driven models. To assess the performance of the proposed methodology, statistical analyses are conducted for two case studies in the Andean region, where comparative analyses are performed for the individual models and the hybrid technique. New hydrological insights: The results indicate that the proposed technique is able to improve the individual performance of physical and ANN-based models, yielding good results in the calibration and validation stages for the two case studies. Specifically, increases in NSE were observed from 0.64 to 0.99 in the MachAngara Alto river, and from 0.88 to 0.99 in the Chulco river. Higher accuracy of the hybrid technique was observed for all evaluation criteria considered in the analyses. The performance of the hybrid technique was also reflected in terms of water supply and demand, suggesting possible applications for the regional management of water resources, where accurate flow predictions are of utmost importance.","[Farfan, Juan F.] Univ A Coruna, Water & Environm Engn Grp, Elvina Campus N, La Coruna 15071, Spain; [Palacios, Karina; Aviles, Alex] Univ Cuenca, Fac Chem Sci, Environm Engn Career, Av 12 Abril,S-N,Av Loja, Cuenca 010203, Ecuador; [Ulloa, Jacinto] Katholieke Univ Leuven, Dept Civil Engn, Kasteelpk Arenberg 40, B-3001 Leuven, Belgium",,"Farfan, JF (corresponding author), Univ A Coruna, Water & Environm Engn Grp, Elvina Campus N, La Coruna 15071, Spain.",juan.farfand@udc.es; jacintoisrael.ulloa@kuleuven.be,"Ulloa, Jacinto/AAR-5113-2021; Avilés, Alex/AAZ-6060-2020; Farfán-Durán, Juan F./AAI-8230-2021","Ulloa, Jacinto/0000-0001-7616-5408; Avilés, Alex/0000-0001-9278-5738; Farfán-Durán, Juan F./0000-0001-8503-2324; Palacios Garate, Karina Fernanda/0000-0003-2134-4155",University of Cuenca through its Research Department (DIUC); la variabilidad climatica y cambio climatico,This work was funded by the University of Cuenca through its Research Department (DIUC) as part of the project titled Evaluacion del riesgo de sequias en cuencas andinas reguladas influenciadas por la variabilidad climatica y cambio climatico.

Skillful seasonal forecasts can drastically aid practical applications and productive sectors by reducing weather-related risks such as water availability. In this study two operational seasonal forecasting systems are tested in a water resource important watershed on the island of Crete. Hindcast precipitation and temperature data from the European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts (ECMWF) System 4 and Met Office GloSea5 systems are tested for their forecast skill up to seven months ahead. Data of both systems are downscaled and corrected for biases towards the observations. Different correction methods are applied and evaluated. Post-processed data from these methods are used as an input to the hydrological model HYPE, to provide streamflow forecasts. Results show that a prior adjustment of the two systems' precipitation and temperature may improve their forecast skill. Adjusted GloSea5 forecasts are slightly better estimates than the corresponding forecasts based on System 4. The results show that both systems provide a skillful ensemble streamflow prediction for one month ahead, with the skill decreasing rapidly beyond that. Update of the initial state of HYPE results in the reduction of the variability of the ensemble flow predictions and improves the skill but only as far as two months of forecast. Finally, the two systems were tested for their ability to capture a limited number of historical streamflow drought events, with indications that GloSea5 has a slightly better skill.","[Grillakis, Manolis; Koutroulis, Aristeidis; Tsanis, Ioannis] Tech Univ Crete, Sch Environm Engn, Khania 73100, Greece",,"Grillakis, M (corresponding author), Tech Univ Crete, Sch Environm Engn, Khania 73100, Greece.",manolis@hydromech.gr; aris@hydromech.gr; tsanis@hydromech.gr,"Koutroulis, Aristeidis/O-9601-2016; Koutroulis, Aristeidis/H-4393-2019; Grillakis, Manolis/I-3582-2019","Koutroulis, Aristeidis/0000-0002-2999-7575; Koutroulis, Aristeidis/0000-0002-2999-7575; Grillakis, Manolis/0000-0002-4228-1803",Horizon 2020 Framework programme through the project IMPREX [641811],This research is funded by the Horizon 2020 Framework programme through the project IMPREX (grant agreement no. 641811).,,72,7,7,1,9,MDPI,BASEL,"ST ALBAN-ANLAGE 66, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND",2073-4441,,,WATER-SUI,Water,NOV,2018,10,11,,,,,,,1593,10.3390/w10111593,,,16,Environmental Sciences; Water Resources,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),Environmental Sciences & Ecology; Water Resources,HC3XM,WOS:000451736300100,,gold,,,2022-02-17

While near-real time tools to detect forest change based on satellite remote sensing exist, these ecosystems have relatively stable natural vegetation dynamics. Open (i.e. non-forest) ecosystems like grasslands, savannas and shrublands are more challenging as they show complex natural dynamics due to factors such as fire, postfire recovery, greater contribution of bare soil to observed vegetation indices, as well as high sensitivity to rainfall and strong seasonality. Tools to aid the management of open ecosystems are desperately required as they dominate much of the globe and harbour substantial biodiversity and carbon. We present an innovative approach that overcomes the difficulties posed by open ecosystems by using a spatio-temporal hierarchical Bayesian model that uses data on climate, topography, soils and fire history to generate ecological forecasts of the expected land surface signal under natural conditions. This allows us to monitor and detect abrupt or gradual changes in the state of an ecosystem in near-real time by identifying areas where the observed vegetation signal has deviated from the expected natural variation. We apply our approach to a case study from the hyperdiverse fire-dependent African shrubland, the fynbos of the Cape Floristic Region, a Global Biodiversity Hotspot and UNESCO World Heritage Site that faces a number of threats to vegetation health and ecosystem function. The case study demonstrates that our approach is useful for identifying a range of change agents such as fire, alien plant species invasions, drought, pathogen outbreaks and clearing of vegetation. We describe and provide our full workflow, including an interactive web application. Our approach is highly versatile, allowing us to collect data on the impacts of change agents for research in ecology and earth system science, and to predict aspects of ecosystem structure and function such as biomass, fire return interval and the influence of vegetation on hydrology.","[Slingsby, Jasper A.; Moncrieff, Glenn R.] Fynbos Node, South African Environm Observat Network, Private Bag X7,Rhodes Dr, ZA-7735 Claremont, South Africa; [Slingsby, Jasper A.] Univ Cape Town, Ctr Stat Ecol Environm & Conservat, Dept Biol Sci, Private Bag X3, ZA-7701 Rondebosch, South Africa; [Moncrieff, Glenn R.] Univ Cape Town, Ctr Stat Ecol Environm & Conservat, Dept Stat Sci, Private Bag X3, ZA-7701 Rondebosch, South Africa; [Wilson, Adam M.] Univ Buffalo, Dept Geog, 120 Wilkeson Quad, Buffalo, NY 14261 USA",,"Slingsby, JA (corresponding author), Fynbos Node, South African Environm Observat Network, Private Bag X7,Rhodes Dr, ZA-7735 Claremont, South Africa.",jasper@saeon.ac.za,"Slingsby, Jasper/AAU-7259-2021","Slingsby, Jasper/0000-0003-1246-1181",National Research Foundation of South AfricaNational Research Foundation - South Africa [118593]; NASANational Aeronautics & Space Administration (NASA) [80NSSC18K0435],"This contribution is derived from our submission to the United Nations Global Pulse Data for Climate Action competition, EMMA: Ecosystem Monitoring for Management Application, which won the Thematic Award for Climate Mitigation.

Monthly, basin-averaged soil moisture, snow water equivalent (SWE), precipitation, and the Pacific sea surface temperature (SST) are selected as potential predictors. Pacific SST predictors (PSPs) are derived from a dipole pattern over the Pacific (30 degrees S-65 degrees N) that is correlated with the lagging streamflow. For both models, the correlation between the hindcasted and observed streamflow exceeds 0.60 for lead times less than 4 months using soil moisture, SWE, and precipitation as predictors. This correlation is higher than that of an autoregression model (correlation similar to 0.50). Since these land surface and atmospheric variables have no statistically significant correlations with the streamflow, PSPs are then incorporated into the models. The two models have a correlation of similar to 0.50 using PSPs alone for lead times from 6 to 9 months, and such skills are probably associated with stronger correlation between SST and streamflow in recent decades. The similar prediction skills between the two models suggest a largely linear system between SST and streamflow. Four predictors together can further improve short-lead prediction skills (correlation similar to 0.80). Therefore, our results confirm the advantage of the Pacific SST information in predicting the UCRB streamflow with a long lead time and can provide useful climate information for water supply planning and decisions.","[Zhao, Siyu; Fu, Rong; Zhuang, Yizhou; Wang, Gaoyun] Univ Calif Los Angeles, Dept Atmospher & Ocean Sci, Los Angeles, CA 90095 USA; [Wang, Gaoyun] Peking Univ, Sch Phys, Dept Atmospher & Ocean Sci, Beijing, Peoples R China",,"Zhao, SY (corresponding author), Univ Calif Los Angeles, Dept Atmospher & Ocean Sci, Los Angeles, CA 90095 USA.",siyu_zhao@atmos.ucla.edu,"; Zhuang, Yizhou/E-4101-2017","Zhao, Siyu/0000-0003-3754-4354; Zhuang, Yizhou/0000-0001-9335-8535",California Department of Water Resources Grant [4600013129]; NOAA Award [NA170AR4310123]; National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) Climate Indicators and Data Products for Future National Climate Assessment [NNX16AN12G],"We thank the three anonymous reviewers for their insightful comments.

A near real-time hydrologic simulation framework is implemented with a lead time of nine months (March-December 2017) by integrating the calibrated SWAT model with National Centers for Environmental Prediction coupled forecast system model version 2 (CFSv2) weather data to forecast daily water balance components. The modeling exercise is conducted as a precursor for various future hydrologic studies (retrospective or forecasting) for the region by providing a calibrated hydrological dataset at high spatial (HUC-12) and temporal (1-day) resolution. The models are calibrated (January 2003-December 2010) and validated (January 2011-December 2013) for each watershed using the observed streamflow data from 50 United States Geological Survey (USGS) gauging stations. The water balance analysis for the region shows that the implemented models satisfactorily represent the hydrology of the region across different sub-regions (Appalachian highlands, plains, and coastal wetlands) and seasons. While CFSv2-driven SWAT models are able to provide reasonable performance in near real-time and can be used for decision making in the region, caution is advised for using model outputs as the streamflow forecasts display significant deviation from observed streamflow for all watersheds for lead times greater than a month.","[Sehgal, Vinit; Sridhar, Venkataramana; Ogejo, Jactone Arogo] Virginia Polytech Inst & State Univ, Dept Biol Syst Engn, Blacksburg, VA 24061 USA; [Sehgal, Vinit] Texas A&M Univ, Water Management & Hydrol Sci, College Stn, TX 77840 USA; [Juran, Luke] Virginia Polytech Inst & State Univ, Dept Geog, Blacksburg, VA 24061 USA; [Juran, Luke] Virginia Polytech Inst & State Univ, Virginia Water Resources Res Ctr, Blacksburg, VA 24061 USA",,"Sridhar, V (corresponding author), Virginia Polytech Inst & State Univ, Dept Biol Syst Engn, Blacksburg, VA 24061 USA.",vinit@vt.edu; vsri@vt.edu; ljuran@vt.edu; arogo@vt.edu,"Sehgal, Vinit/H-5848-2018; Ogejo, Jactone A/M-1232-2013; Sridhar, Venkat/AAT-6676-2020","Sehgal, Vinit/0000-0002-8837-5864; Ogejo, Jactone A/0000-0002-4182-6891; Sridhar, Venkat/0000-0002-1003-2247","Virginia Agricultural Experiment Station (Blacksburg); Hatch Program of the National Institute of Food and Agriculture, U.S Department of Agriculture (Washington, D.C.)","This project was funded, in part, by the Virginia Agricultural Experiment Station (Blacksburg) and the Hatch Program of the National Institute of Food and Agriculture, U.S Department of Agriculture (Washington, D.C.).",,109,11,11,1,10,MDPI,BASEL,"ST ALBAN-ANLAGE 66, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND",,2071-1050,,SUSTAINABILITY-BASEL,Sustainability,SEP,2018,10,9,,,,,,,3079,10.3390/su10093079,,,27,Green & Sustainable Science & Technology; Environmental Sciences; Environmental Studies,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Science & Technology - Other Topics; Environmental Sciences & Ecology,GW3DA,WOS:000446770200122,,"Green Submitted, gold",,,2022-02-17

Projected changes in precipitation, potential evapotranspiration (PET) and streamflow at different temporal scales are examined by dynamically downscaling climate projections derived from 15 Coupled Model Intercomparison Project Phase 5 (CMIP5) general circulation models (GCMs). Our findings reveal that the Upper Coast Climate Division of Texas is projected to experience the most remarkable wetting caused by precipitation and PET changes, whereas the most significant drying is expected to occur for the North Central Texas Climate Division. The dry Guadalupe River basin is projected to become drier with a substantial increase in future drought risks, especially for the summer season. And the extreme precipitation events are projected to increase in frequency and intensity with a reduction in overall precipitation frequency, which may result in more frequent occurrences of flash floods and drought episodes in the Guadalupe River basin.","[Wang, S.] Hong Kong Polytech Univ, Dept Land Surveying & Geoinformat, Hong Kong, Peoples R China; [Wang, Y.] Texas Tech Univ, Dept Geosci, Lubbock, TX 79409 USA",,"Wang, S (corresponding author), Hong Kong Polytech Univ, Dept Land Surveying & Geoinformat, Hong Kong, Peoples R China.",shuo.s.wang@polyu.edu.hk,"Wang, Shuo/I-3017-2013","Wang, Shuo/0000-0001-7827-187X",National Natural Science Foundation of ChinaNational Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC) [51809223]; Hong Kong Polytechnic UniversityHong Kong Polytechnic University [1-ZE8S]; Texas Tech Research Assistant Professorship Initiative,This research was supported by the National Natural Science Foundation of China (Grant No. 51809223) and the Hong Kong Polytechnic University Start-up Grant (Grant No. 1-ZE8S).

Newer deep learning algorithms exhibited improved inflow forecasting accuracy, but existing research has been mostly limited to real-time operation and short-term planning. We propose a new multi-step forecasting approach to improve long-term forecasting accuracy for both water supply and inflow volumes. This approach uses historical snow water equivalent (SWE) and reservoir inflow time-series data to train an Encoder-Decoder algorithm to predict the reservoir inflow of future time-steps during the April-July runoff period. The optimal model and hyperparameters are selected through five-fold time-series cross validation for variations between long shortterm memory (LSTM) and convolutional neural network (CNN) Encoder-Decoder algorithms. We evaluated each algorithm using 30 years of reservoir inflow and SWE data at the Upper Stillwater Reservoir located in Utah. The optimal model was an LSTM Encoder-Decoder algorithm with 16 nodes per layer. Using this algorithm, we investigate the trade-off between model complexity and accuracy for long-term water supply, relative to a process-based Ensemble Streamflow Prediction (ESP) model as a baseline and simpler statistical methods traditionally used in forecasting (SARIMA, VAR, TBATS). Long-term water supply forecasts of the optimal deep learning algorithm proved superior to statistical methods and rivaled those of the ESP 50% exceedance probability forecast (i.e. the most probable forecast) evaluated over five consecutive hold-out periods.","[Herbert, Zachary C.] Cent Utah Water Conservancy Dist, 1426 E 750 N, Orem, UT 84097 USA; [Asghar, Zeeshan; Oroza, Carlos A.] Univ Utah, Floyd & Jeri Meldrum Civil Engn Bldg, Salt Lake City, UT 84112 USA",,"Herbert, ZC (corresponding author), Cent Utah Water Conservancy Dist, 1426 E 750 N, Orem, UT 84097 USA.",zachary@cuwed.com; u1265332@utah.du; Carlos.Oroza@utah.edu,,,Central Utah Water Conservancy District and University of Utah,"This research was supported by the Central Utah Water Conservancy District and University of Utah.

They are heavily influenced by atmospheric river (AR) storms that produce both beneficial water supply and hazards; for example, 84% of all flood damages in the West (up to 99% in key areas) are associated with ARs. However, AR landfall forecast position errors can exceed 200 km at even 1-day lead time and yet many watersheds are <100 km across, which contributes to issues such as the 2017 Oroville Dam spillway incident and regularly to large flood forecast errors. Combined with the rise of wildfires and deadly post-wildfire debris flows, such as Montecito (2018), the need for better AR forecasts is urgent. Atmospheric River Reconnaissance (AR Recon) was developed as a research and operations partnership to address these needs. It combines new observations, modeling, data assimilation, and forecast verification methods to improve the science and predictions of landfalling ARs. ARs over the northeast Pacific are measured using dropsondes from up to three aircraft simultaneously. Additionally, airborne radio occultation is being tested, and drifting buoys with pressure sensors are deployed. AR targeting and data collection methods have been developed, assimilation and forecast impact experiments are ongoing, and better understanding of AR dynamics is emerging. AR Recon is led by the Center for Western Weather and Water Extremes and NWS/NCEP. The effort's core partners include the U.S. Navy, U.S. Air Force, NCAR, ECMWF, and multiple academic institutions. AR Recon is included in the National Winter Season Operations Plan to support improved outcomes for emergency preparedness and water management in the West.","[Ralph, F.

Machine-learning models proffer an empirically based approach to predicting water temperatures with a high degree of accuracy. This study explores the potential of long short-term neural network (LSTM), a type of deep learning method, to forecast daily river water temperatures and quantify temporal variations in thermal regime induced by changes in climate and by dam construction. The performance of LSTM is compared with that of several other models using daily water-temperature data for nine river gauges around the world. In a detailed analysis, the models are evaluated for the Yichang gauge on the Yangtze River to reconstruct the natural thermal conditions and help to assess daily water temperature variations induced by operation of the Three Gorges Reservoir (TGR). The collective results show that LSTM outperforms other methods for predicting mean daily water temperature in rivers, capturing accurately mean daily variations in thermal regime. The construction of the TGR strongly influenced water temperature variations at Yichang, producing the strongest cooling effect from mid-April to mid-May and the greatest warming effect in late December and early January. These marked effects are most prominent at the highest water levels in the TGR. The enhanced predictive capabilities of the LSTM model provide a powerful tool for water temperature forecasting and ecological management of rivers in the Anthropocene.","[Qiu, Rujian; Wang, Yuankun; Wang, Dong; Qiu, Wenjie; Tao, Yuwei; Wu, Jichun] Nanjing Univ, Sch Earth Sci & Engn, Dept Hydrosci, Key Lab Surficial Geochem,Minist Educ,State Key L, Nanjing, Peoples R China; [Rhoads, Bruce] Univ Illinois, Dept Geog & Geog Informat Sci, Champaign, IL USA",,"Wang, YK (corresponding author), Nanjing Univ, Sch Earth Sci & Engn, Dept Hydrosci, Key Lab Surficial Geochem,Minist Educ,State Key L, Nanjing, Peoples R China.",yuankunw@nju.edu.cn,,,National Key Research and Development Program of China [2017YFC1502704]; National Natural Science Fund of ChinaNational Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC) [51679118],"This study was supported by National Key Research and Development Program of China (2017YFC1502704), and National Natural Science Fund of China (No.51679118).",,64,4,4,23,36,ELSEVIER,AMSTERDAM,"RADARWEG 29, 1043 NX AMSTERDAM, NETHERLANDS",0022-1694,1879-2707,,J HYDROL,J.

For their sustainable treatment, future prediction of AMD quantity is crucial. In this study, AMD quantity was predicted for two closed mines in Japan based on a series tank model in three stages. The tank model parameters were determined from the relationship between the observed AMD quantity and the inflow of rainfall and snowmelt by using the Kalman filter and particle swarm optimization methods. The Automated Meteorological Data Acquisition System (AMeDAS) data of rainfall were corrected for elevation and by the statistical daily fluctuation model. The snowmelt was estimated from the AMeDAS data of rainfall, temperature, and sunshine duration by using mass and heat balance of snow. Fitting with one year of daily data was sufficient to obtain the AMD quantity model. Future AMD quantity was predicted by the constructed model using the forecast data of rainfall and temperature proposed by the Max Planck Institute-Earth System Model (MPI-ESM), based on the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) representative concentration pathway (RCP) 2.6 and RCP8.5 scenarios. The results showed that global warming causes an increase in the quantity and fluctuation of AMD, especially for large reservoirs and residence time of AMD. There is a concern that for mines with large AMD quantities, AMD treatment will be unstable due to future global warming.","[Tokoro, Chiharu; Fuchida, Shigeshi] Waseda Univ, Fac Sci & Engn, Shinjuku Ku, 3-4-1 Okubo, Tokyo 1698555, Japan; [Fukaki, Kenichiro; Kadokura, Masakazu] Waseda Univ, Grad Sch Creat Sci & Engn, Shinjuku Ku, 3-4-1 Okubo, Tokyo 1698555, Japan",,"Tokoro, C (corresponding author), Waseda Univ, Fac Sci & Engn, Shinjuku Ku, 3-4-1 Okubo, Tokyo 1698555, Japan.",tokoro@waseda.jp; kf-2219-rikoh@ruri.waseda.jp; masa-kado0413@akane.waseda.jp; sfuchida@aoni.waseda.jp,,"Tokoro, Chiharu/0000-0001-6214-0402","JOGMEC (Japan Oil, Gas and Metals National Corporation); Center for Eco-Mining, Japan","This research was partially funded by JOGMEC (Japan Oil, Gas and Metals National Corporation) and the Center for Eco-Mining, Japan.",,49,5,5,2,3,MDPI,BASEL,"ST ALBAN-ANLAGE 66, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND",,2075-163X,,MINERALS-BASEL,Minerals,MAY,2020,10,5,,,,,,,430,10.3390/min10050430,,,14,Geochemistry & Geophysics; Mineralogy; Mining & Mineral Processing,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),Geochemistry & Geophysics; Mineralogy; Mining & Mineral Processing,MJ8NC,WOS:000548343700045,,gold,,,2022-02-17

As for many traditional statistical models, forecasting flood peak discharge is nearly impossible. They can only get acceptable results in normal year. On the other hand, the numerical methods including physics mechanisms and rainfall-atmospherics could provide a better performance when floods coming, but the minima prediction period of them is about one month ahead, which is too short to be used in hydrological application. In this study, a deep neural network was employed to predict the streamflow of the Hankou Hydrological Station on the Yangtze River. This method combined the Empirical Mode Decomposition (EMD) algorithm and Encoder Decoder Long Short-Term Memory (En-De-LSTM) architecture. Owing to the hydrological series prediction problem usually contains several different frequency components, which will affect the precision of the longtime prediction. The EMD technique could read and decomposes the original data into several different frequency components. It will help the model to make longtime predictions more efficiently. The LSTM based En-De-LSTM neural network could make the forecasting closer to the observed in peak flow value through reading, training, remembering the valuable information and forgetting the useless data. Monthly streamflow data (from January 1952 to December 2008) from Hankou Hydrological Station on the Yangtze River was selected to train the model, and predictions were made in two years with catastrophic flood events and ten years rolling forecast. Furthermore, the Root Mean Square Error (RMSE), Coefficient of Determination (R-2), Willmott & x2019;s Index of agreement (WI) and the Legates-McCabe & x2019;s Index (LMI) were used to evaluate the goodness-of-fit and performance of this model.

This can be seen in the rising number of related works published. This culminated further with the combination of pioneering optimization techniques. Who would have thought that the birds and the bees can offer advances in the mathematical sciences and so have the ants too? The ingenuity of humans is spelled out in the algorithms that mimic many natural activities, like pack hunting by the wolves! This review paper serves to broadcast more of the intriguing interest in newfound procedures in optimal forecasting. Reservoirs are the main and most efficient water storage facilities for managing uneven water distribution. However, due to the major global climate changes which affect rainfall trend and weather, it has been a necessity to find an alternative solution for effective conventional water balance. A multifunctional reservoir operation appears to require the operator to make wise decisions to achieve an optimal reservoir operation. One of the most important aspects of all this is the forecasting of streamflows. For this, Artificial Intelligence (AI) seems to be the best alternative solution; as in the past three decades, there has been a drastic increase in building and developing AI models for forecasting and modelling unstable patterns in various hydrological fields. Nevertheless, AI models are also required to be optimized in tandem to achieve the best result, leading thus to the desirous forming of hybrid models between a standalone AI model and optimization techniques. This comprehensive study categorizes machine learning into three main categories, together with the optimization techniques, and will next explore the various AI model used for different hydrology fields along with the most common optimization techniques.

In this research, we develop streamflow forecasts for Lake Urmia basin, Iran, specifically for inflow into the Boukan and Mahabad reservoirs. In doing so, two types of inflow forecast models are considered: a single site univariate model ignoring the cross correlation between streamflow at different stations, and a multi-site multivariate forecast model which takes into consideration the cross correlations among stations. Predictor selection is performed through a principal component analysis and an adaptive-network-based fuzzy inference system is used to forecast streamflow. Forecast performance is investigated by employing different combinations of large-scale climatic information and hydrologic data. We found that gridded ocean-atmospheric circulation variables, including surface precipitation rate and omega (pressure vertical velocity), have the highest correlations (about 0.7) with annual streamflow. In general, multivariate models are able to better preserve the annual cross-correlations between streamflow at different stations, as expected, without sacrificing forecast skill as compared to the univariate forecast model approach. Additionally, as compared with the baseline feed-forward artificial neural network- and traditional multiple linear regression-forecast models, the results were approximately the same. This similarity in the forecast performance between the linear and nonlinear models is likely due to the short of data (44-sample record).","[Moradi, Amir M.; Dariane, Alireza B.] KN Toosi Univ Technol, Dept Civil Engn, Tehran, Iran; [Yang, Guang; Block, Paul] Univ Wisconsin, Dept Civil & Environm Engn, Madison, WI 53706 USA",,"Moradi, AM (corresponding author), KN Toosi Univ Technol, Dept Civil Engn, Mirdamad Intersect, 1346 Valiasr St, Tehran 1996715433, Iran.",a.m.moradi@mail.kntu.ac.ir,"Moradi, Amir Mohammad/P-7992-2014","Moradi, Amir Mohammad/0000-0002-2701-300X; Yang, Guang/0000-0001-7330-3502",,,,68,7,7,0,6,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0899-8418,1097-0088,,INT J CLIMATOL,Int.

In this paper, two catchments under different conditions, Xin'an River Basin and Wuding River Basin, were selected as the representatives of humid and arid regions, respectively, and four kinds of satellite rainfall data of TRMM 3B42RT, TRMM 3B42V7, GPM IMERG Early, and GPM IMERG Late were selected to evaluate the monitoring accuracy of rainfall processes in the two catchments on hourly scale. Then, these satellite rainfall data were respectively integrated with the gauged data. HEC-HMS (The Hydrologic Engineering Center's-Hydrologic Modeling System) model was calibrated and validated to simulate flood events in the two catchments. Then, improvement effect of the rainfall merging on flood forecasting was evaluated. According to the research results, in most cases, the Nash-Sutcliffe efficiency coefficients of the simulated streamflow from initial TRMM (Tropical Rainfall Measuring Mission) and GPM (Global Precipitation Measurement) satellite rainfall data were negative at the two catchments. By merging gauge and TRMM rainfall, the Nash-Sutcliffe efficiency coefficient is mostly around 0.7, and the correlation coefficient is as high as 0.9 for streamflow simulation in the Xin'an River basin. For the streamflow simulated by merging gauge and GPM rainfall in Wuding River basin, the Nash-Sutcliffe efficiency coefficient is about 0.8, and the correlation coefficient is more than 0.9, which indicate good flood forecasting accuracy. Generally, higher performance statistics were obtained in the Xin'an River Basin than the Wuding River Basin. Compared with the streamflow simulated by the initial satellite rainfalls, significant improvement was obtained by the merged rainfall data, which indicates a good prospect for application of satellite rainfall in hydrological forecasting. In the future, it is necessary to further improve the monitoring accuracy of satellite rainfall products and to develop the method of merging multi-source rainfall data, so as to better applications in PUB and other hydrological researches.","[Min, Xinyi; Yang, Chuanguo; Dong, Ningpeng] Hohai Univ, Coll Hydrol & Water Resources, Nanjing 210098, Peoples R China; [Min, Xinyi; Yang, Chuanguo; Dong, Ningpeng] Hohai Univ, State Key Lab Hydrol Water Resources & Hydraul En, Nanjing 210098, Peoples R China; [Dong, Ningpeng] China Inst Water Resources & Hydropower Res, Dept Water Resources, Beijing 100038, Peoples R China",,"Yang, CG (corresponding author), Hohai Univ, Coll Hydrol & Water Resources, Nanjing 210098, Peoples R China.; Yang, CG (corresponding author), Hohai Univ, State Key Lab Hydrol Water Resources & Hydraul En, Nanjing 210098, Peoples R China.",fowlervivian66@gmail.com; cgyang@hhu.edu.cn; dnp908393893@gmail.com,,,"National Key R&D Program of China [2016YFC0402706]; Fundamental Research Funds for the Central UniversitiesFundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities [2018B55114]; Special Scientific Research Fund of the Meteorological Public Welfare Profession of China [GYHY201406021]; National Natural Science Foundation of ChinaNational Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC) [41471016, 51539003]; Special Fund of State Key Laboratory of Hydrology-Water Resources and Hydraulic Engineering [20185044012]","This research was funded by the National Key R&D Program of China (grant number 2016YFC0402706); Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities (grant number 2018B55114); Special Scientific Research Fund of the Meteorological Public Welfare Profession of China (grant number GYHY201406021); National Natural Science Foundation of China (grant number 41471016, 51539003); and Special Fund of State Key Laboratory of Hydrology-Water Resources and Hydraulic Engineering (grant number 20185044012).",,38,1,1,8,10,MDPI,BASEL,"ST ALBAN-ANLAGE 66, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND",,2073-4441,,WATER-SUI,Water,MAR,2020,12,3,,,,,,,802,10.3390/w12030802,,,17,Environmental Sciences; Water Resources,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),Environmental Sciences & Ecology; Water Resources,LI1MS,WOS:000529249500187,,gold,,,2022-02-17

Initially conservative estimates of future (in)flows in rivers and reservoirs may lead to unnecessary reduction of the water allocated. Though water allocations may be revised as the season progresses, inconsistency in allocation is undesirable to farmers as they may then not be able to use that water, leading to an opportunity cost in agricultural production. We assess the benefit of using reservoir inflow estimates derived from seasonal forecast datasets to improve water allocation decisions. A decision model is developed to emulate the feedback loop between simulated reservoir storage and water allocations to irrigated crops and is evaluated using inflow forecasts generated with the Forecast Guided Stochastic Scenarios (FoGSS) model, a 12-month ensemble streamflow forecasting system. Two forcings are used to generate the forecasts: ensemble streamflow prediction - ESP (historical rainfall) - and POAMA (calibrated rainfall forecasts from the POAMA climate prediction system). We evaluate the approach in the Murrumbidgee basin in Australia, comparing water allocations obtained with an expected reservoir inflow from FoGSS against the allocations obtained with the currently used conservative estimate based on climatology as well as against allocations obtained using observed inflows (perfect information). The inconsistency in allocated water is evaluated by determining the total changes in allocated water made every 15 d from the initial allocation at the start of the water year to the end of the irrigation season, including both downward and upward revisions of allocations. Results show that the inconsistency due to upward revisions in allocated water is lower when using the forecast datasets (POAMA and ESP) compared to the conservative inflow estimates (reference), which is beneficial to the planning of cropping areas by farmers. Overconfidence can, however, lead to an increase in undesirable downward revisions. This is more evident for dry years than for wet years. Over the 28 years for which allocation decisions are evaluated, we find that the accuracy of the available water estimates using the forecast ensemble improves progressively during the water year, especially 1.5 months before the start of the cropping season in November. This is significant as it provides farmers with additional time to make key decisions on planting. Our results show that seasonal streamflow forecasts can provide benefit in informing water allocation policies, particularly by earlier establishing final water allocations to farmers in the irrigation season. This allows them to plan better and use water allocated more efficiently.","[Kaune, Alexander; Chowdhury, Faysal; Werner, Micha] IHE Delft Inst Water Educ, Water Resources & Ecosyst Dept, Delft, Netherlands; [Kaune, Alexander] Wageningen Univ & Res, Wageningen Inst Environm & Climate Res, Wageningen, Netherlands; [Kaune, Alexander] FutureWater, Costerweg 1V, NL-6702 AA Wageningen, Netherlands; [Werner, Micha] Deltares, Div Inland Water Syst, Delft, Netherlands; [Bennett, James] CSIRO Land & Water, Clayton, Vic, Australia; [Bennett, James] Univ Tasmania, Inst Marine & Antarctic Studies, Battery Point, Tas, Australia",,"Kaune, A (corresponding author), IHE Delft Inst Water Educ, Water Resources & Ecosyst Dept, Delft, Netherlands.; Kaune, A (corresponding author), Wageningen Univ & Res, Wageningen Inst Environm & Climate Res, Wageningen, Netherlands.; Kaune, A (corresponding author), FutureWater, Costerweg 1V, NL-6702 AA Wageningen, Netherlands.",a.kaune@futurewater.nl,"; Werner, Micha/C-8144-2009","Kaune, Alexander/0000-0003-3727-3267; Werner, Micha/0000-0003-4198-5638; Chowdhury, Mohammad Faysal/0000-0002-4847-7778",European Union Seventh Framework Programme (FP7/2007-2013) [603608]; CSIRO Land Water; Bureau of MeteorologyBureau of Meteorology - Australia; ARC linkage projectAustralian Research Council [LP170100922],"This work received funding from the European Union Seventh Framework Programme (FP7/2007-2013) under grant agreement no. 603608, Global Earth Observation for Integrated Water Resource Assessment (eartH2Observe).

This paper presents a forecasting approach to deal with a newly addressed situation where hydrological data exist for a period longer than that of meteorological data (measurements asymmetry). In fact, one of the potential solutions to resolve measurements asymmetry issue is data re-sampling. It is a matter of either considering only the hydrological data or the balanced part of the hydro-meteorological data set during the forecasting process. However, the main disadvantage is that we may lose potentially relevant information from the left-out data. In this research, the key output is a Two-Phase Constructive Fuzzy inference hybrid model that is implemented over the non re-sampled data. The introduced modeling approach must be capable of exploiting the available data efficiently with higher prediction efficiency relative to Constructive Fuzzy Model trained over re-sampled' data set. The study was applied to Litani River in the Bekaa Valley Lebanon by using 4 years of rainfall and 24 years of river flow daily measurements. A Constructive Fuzzy System Model (C-FSM) and a Two-Phase Constructive Fuzzy System Model (TPC-FSM) are trained. Upon validating, the second model has shown a primarily competitive performance and accuracy with the ability to preserve a higher day-to-day variability for 1, 3 and 6 days ahead. In fact, for the longest lead period, the C-FSM and TPC-FSM were able of explaining respectively 84.6% and 86.5% of the actual river flow variation. Overall, the results indicate that TPC-FSM model has provided a better tool to capture extreme flows in the process of streamflow prediction. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V.

We analyzed simulations of three-selected Representative Concentration Pathways 8.5 Global Climate Models (GCM) (i.e. HadGEM2-ES, MPI-ESM-LR and GFDL-ESM2M). These GCMs which, were part of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) Fifth Assessment Report, were selected as well performing GCMs that represent the historic climatology and prevailing precipitation bearing synoptic conditions in the southwest US. An analysis of both statistically and dynamically downscaled simulations projected increase in the frequency of dry winters during the mid-21st century (2020-2059) in two out of the three selected GCMs. For summer precipitation, the statistically downscaled simulations are inconclusive whereas, the dynamically downscaled simulations showed significant but contradicting future projections. In order to assess the impact of the projected climate on the hydrologic cycle at the Bill Williams River basins, we developed a modeling framework that includes the following components: 1) a weather generator that produces realizations of likely hourly precipitation events over the basin; 2) a hydrologic model that is based on the Colorado Basin River Forecast Center (CBRFC), National Weather Service modeling configuration that predicts flow at ten internal points and inflow into Alamo Lake; and 3) a lake model with the existing operation rules to simulates the lake outflow and levels. Using the above-described modeling framework, the impact of the projected mid 21-century climate on Alamo Lake was examined with respect to the total outflow from the dam, the frequency of large outflow events, and the frequency of high and low lake levels. The results show that dynamic downscaling provides a larger range of impacts than those provided by statistical downscaling. The results also indicate a wide range of impact scenarios with contradicting trends among the selected climate projections for mid-21st Century. These results imply increasing challenges in operating the Lake at its target level. This modeling framework can potentially be used to examine various future scenarios and to develop recommendations for a sustainable management scheme for the Alamo Lake. (C) 2019 The Author(s).

Sediment availability is a prerequisite for the sustained transfer of material between these areas, and for the eco-geomorphic functioning of river networks in general. However, the difficulty of monitoring sediment availability and movement at the reach or corridor scale has hindered our ability to quantify and forecast the response of sediment transfer to hydrologic or land cover alterations. Here we leverage spatiotemporally extensive datasets quantifying sediment areal coverage along a 28 km reach of the Colorado River in Grand Canyon, southwestern USA. In concert with information on hydrologic alteration and vegetation encroachment resulting from the operation of Glen Canyon Dam (constructed in 1963) upstream of our study reach, we model the relative and combined influence of changes in (a) flow and (b) riparian vegetation extent on the areal extent of sediment available for transport in the river valley over the period from 1921 to 2016. In addition, we use projections of future streamflow and vegetation encroachment to forecast sediment availability over the 20 year period from 2016 to 2036. We find that hydrologic alteration has reduced the areal extent of bare sediment by 9% from the pre- to post-dam periods, whereas vegetation encroachment further reduced bare sediment extent by 45%. Over the next 20 years, the extent of bare sediment is forecast to be reduced by an additional 12%. Our results demonstrate the impact of river regulation, specifically the loss of annual low flows and associated vegetation encroachment, on reducing the sediment available for transfer within river valleys. This work provides an extendable framework for using high-resolution data on streamflow and land cover to assess and forecast the impact of watershed perturbation (e.g. river regulation, land cover shifts, climate change) on sediment connectivity at the corridor scale.","[Kasprak, Alan; Sankey, Joel B.; Caster, Joshua; Grams, Paul E.] US Geol Survey, Southwest Biol Sci Ctr, Grand Canyon Monitoring & Res Ctr, Flagstaff, AZ 86001 USA; [Buscombe, Daniel] No Arizona Univ, Sch Earth & Sustainabil, Flagstaff, AZ USA; [East, Amy E.] US Geol Survey, Pacific Coastal & Marine Sci Ctr, Santa Cruz, CA USA",,"Kasprak, A (corresponding author), US Geol Survey, Southwest Biol Sci Ctr, Grand Canyon Monitoring & Res Ctr, Flagstaff, AZ 86001 USA.",akasprak@usgs.gov,,"East, Amy/0000-0002-9567-9460",U.S. Bureau of Reclamation's Glen Canyon Dam Adaptive Management Program; National Center for Earth Surface Dynamics at the University of Minnesota; Mendenhall Postdoctoral Research Fellowship from the USGS,"The author(s) disclosed receipt of the following financial support for the research, authorship, and/or publication of this article: This research was funded by the U.S. Bureau of Reclamation's Glen Canyon Dam Adaptive Management Program, with additional funding from the National Center for Earth Surface Dynamics at the University of Minnesota.

Owing to the influence of real-time inflow forecast uncertainty, determining an informed operation plan necessitates resolution of the conflict between upstream flood risk, downstream flood risk, and water scarcity risk. This study developed a multiobjective stochastic programming with recourses (MOSP) model to seek robust risk-averse plans under multiple risks. In the proposed approach, inflow forecast errors are modeled and sampled as spatially and temporally correlated stochastic processes using a copula function. The multiobjective stochastic programming is solved using the epsilon constraint method based on explicit formulation of multiple risk objectives with discretized inflow scenarios, and a rolling horizon with recourses for real-time operational updating is modeled to address the dynamic decision-making characteristics. The proposed methodologies were applied to the multireservoir system of the Pi River Basin (China), and comparisons with model results of a traditional coupled simulation and a deterministic single objective optimization model were conducted. Results indicated that capturing spatial and temporal dependencies of forecast uncertainty provides informative forecast support. Moreover, noninferior solutions obtained from MOSP dominate the deterministic optimal solution, which could either conserve 4.86 million m(3) (12%) more water without increase in flood risk, or reduce the upstream flood risk by 3.1% without increase in either water scarcity or downstream flood risk during a typical receding flood. The proposed methodology provides a dynamic decision-making modeling tool that could reduce overall risk and determine a compromise for flood water conservation under uncertainty.","[Xu, Bin; Zhong, Ping-an; Lu, Qingwen; Zhu, Feilin; Huang, Xin; Ma, Yufei; Fu, Jisi] Hohai Univ, Coll Hydrol & Water Resources, 1 Xikang Rd, Nanjing 210098, Peoples R China",,"Xu, B; Zhong, PA (corresponding author), Hohai Univ, Coll Hydrol & Water Resources, 1 Xikang Rd, Nanjing 210098, Peoples R China.",xubin_hhu@hhu.edu.cn; pazhong@hhu.edu.cn; luqw@hhu.edu.cn; zhufeilin@hhu.edu.cn; xinhuang@hhu.edu.cn; mayufei@hhu.edu.cn,,,"National Key Technologies R&D Program of ChinaNational Key Technology R&D Program [2017YFC0405604]; Fundamental Research Funds for the Central UniversitiesFundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities [B200202028, B200202032]; China Postdoctoral Science FoundationChina Postdoctoral Science Foundation [2018T110525]; Qing Lan Project of Jiangsu Province","We would like to thank the anonymous reviewers for their in-depth reviews and constructive suggestions.

In addition, the management of RoR plants has to comply with some particular operating conditions, but also with some environmental flow requirements. This work presents the assessment of the main inputs included in a climate service, historical local data and the seasonal forecast of water inflow to RoR plants, which are used to predict the operability and the expected energy production. The analysis is presented through the application in a pilot RoR system located in the south of Spain, in a semi-arid Mediterranean area impacted by snow, where seasonal forecasting is especially challenging. The results show the high interannual variability of the operation in this kind of facilities. The outcomes indicate that seasonal climate forecast information would improve the prediction of observed river streamflow by 7.4% in reliability and 3.2% in sharpness compared to the current operational forecast based on historical data. The climate forecasts thus provide valuable information for the exploitation of available water resources, which generates a significant value for the operation of the plant and the energy production market.","[Contreras, Eva; Herrero, Javier; Aguilar, Cristina; Jose Polo, Maria] Univ Cordoba, Andalusian Inst Earth Syst Res, Fluvial Dynam & Hydrol Res Grp, Cordoba 14071, Spain; [Crochemore, Louise] Swedish Meteorol & Hydrol Inst, Hydrol Res Unit, SE-60176 Norrkoping, Sweden",,"Contreras, E (corresponding author), Univ Cordoba, Andalusian Inst Earth Syst Res, Fluvial Dynam & Hydrol Res Grp, Cordoba 14071, Spain.",econtreras@uco.es; javier.herrero@uco.es; louise.crochemore@smhi.se; caguilar@uco.es; mjpolo@uco.es,"Aguilar, Cristina/AAP-7382-2021; Polo, Maria J./L-8018-2014; Herrero, Javier/K-6880-2014","Aguilar, Cristina/0000-0002-9418-1679; Polo, Maria J./0000-0002-6296-2198; Herrero, Javier/0000-0002-5741-6301; Crochemore, Louise/0000-0001-5776-6275",European Union's Horizon 2020 research and innovation programme [730482],This research was funded by the European Union's Horizon 2020 research and innovation programme under the Gran Agreement No 730482 in the framework of CLARA Project.,,35,5,5,1,7,MDPI,BASEL,"ST ALBAN-ANLAGE 66, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND",,2073-4441,,WATER-SUI,Water,AUG,2020,12,8,,,,,,,2119,10.3390/w12082119,,,16,Environmental Sciences; Water Resources,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),Environmental Sciences & Ecology; Water Resources,NL2FV,WOS:000567238800001,,"Green Published, gold",,,2022-02-17

Methods for generating synthetic forecasts of hydro-meteorological variables are crucial for robust validation of forecast use, as numerical weather prediction hindcasts are only available for a relatively short period (10-40 years) that is insufficient for assessing risk related to forecast-informed decision-making during extreme events. We develop a generalized error model for synthetic forecast generation that is applicable to a range of forecasted variables used in water resources management. The approach samples from the distribution of forecast errors over the available hindcast period and adds them to long records of observed data to generate synthetic forecasts. The approach utilizes the Skew Generalized Error Distribution (SGED) to model marginal distributions of forecast errors that can exhibit heteroskedastic, auto-correlated, and non-Gaussian behavior. An empirical copula is used to capture covariance between variables, forecast lead times, and across space. We demonstrate the method for medium-range forecasts across Northern California in two case studies for (1) streamflow and (2) temperature and precipitation, which are based on hindcasts from the NOAA/NWS Hydrologic Ensemble Forecast System (HEFS) and the NCEP GEFS/R V2 climate model, respectively. The case studies highlight the flexibility of the model and its ability to emulate space-time structures in forecasts at scales critical for water resources management. The proposed method is generalizable to other locations and computationally efficient, enabling fast generation of long synthetic forecast ensembles that are appropriate for risk analysis.","[Brodeur, Zachary P.; Steinschneider, Scott] Cornell Univ, Dept Biol & Environm Engn, Ithaca, NY 14853 USA",,"Brodeur, ZP (corresponding author), Cornell Univ, Dept Biol & Environm Engn, Ithaca, NY 14853 USA.",zpb4@cornell.edu,,"Brodeur, Zachary/0000-0001-5242-7696",U.S. National Science FoundationNational Science Foundation (NSF) [EnvS-1803563],This study was supported by the U.S. National Science Foundation Grant EnvS-1803563.

To generate the flood inundation forecasts, a one-dimensional hydraulic model, namely the Hydrologic Engineering Center's River Analysis System (HEC-RAS), is coupled to a regional hydrological ensemble prediction system (RHEPS). The RHEPS is comprised of: i) hydrometeorological observations; ii) weather ensembles from the National Centers for Environmental Prediction Global Ensemble Forecast System Reforecast version 2 (GEFSRv2); and iii) Hydrology Laboratory Research Distributed Hydrologic Model (HL-RDHM) as the hydrological model. The coupled RHEPS-hydraulic system is evaluated along the tidal Delaware River near the City of Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, U.S. For the evaluation, emphasis is placed on the tidal-riverine transitional zone of the Delaware River and the downstream propagation of hydrometeorological uncertainty through the flood inundation forecasts. The coupled system is used to generate hourly flood inundation forecasts at lead times from 1 to 7 days, over the period 2008-2013. Additionally, WSEs from the coupled system are statistically postprocessed using quantile regression (QR). Results show that the raw flood inundation ensemble forecasts exhibit higher skill than the deterministic ones. We also find that statistical postprocessing improves the skill of the raw flood inundation ensemble forecasts, with greater improvements at the longer lead times (> 3 days). Overall, we find that both weather ensembles and statistical WSE postprocessing can be used to enhance the skill of flood inundation forecasts at short- to medium-range timescales. In turn, this may serve to enhance the spatial representation of flood forecasts several days in advance, which could contribute in the future to making flood forecast communication and warnings more effective.","[Gomez, Michael; Sharma, Sanjib; Mejia, Alfonso] Penn State Univ, Dept Civil & Environm Engn, 219 Sackett Bldg, University Pk, PA 16802 USA; [Reed, Seann] Natl Weather Serv, Middle Atlantic River Forecast Ctr, State Coll, PA USA",,"Gomez, M (corresponding author), Penn State Univ, Dept Civil & Environm Engn, 219 Sackett Bldg, University Pk, PA 16802 USA.",mvg5545@psu.edu,"Sharma, Sanjib/R-4989-2019","Mejia, Alfonso/0000-0003-3891-1822; Gomez, Michael/0000-0002-5906-6819","Ecuadorian government through the Secretariat for Higher Education, Science, Technology and Innovation, Ecuador","The first author acknowledges the funding support provided by the Ecuadorian government through the Secretariat for Higher Education, Science, Technology and Innovation, Ecuador.

Limited availability of the in situ data, especially in case of Transboundary Rivers, further highlights the need to develop and evaluate decision support systems which may predict the flows in real time using open source rainfall data. This paper presents the study conducted in Chenab River catchment, Pakistan, to develop and evaluate a hydrologic model using HEC-HMS for predicting flows based on TRMM rainfall data. The catchment was analyzed for hydro-morphological properties using SRTM DEM in HEC-GeoHMS. To rely on open source data as much as possible, digital soil map of the world developed by FAO and global land cover map developed by European Space Agency were utilized to compute Curve Number grid data for the catchment. These preliminary data analyses were employed to set initial values of different parameters to be used for model calibration. The model was calibrated for five rainfall events occurred in the rainy seasons of 2006, 2010 and 2013. The calibrated model was then validated for four other rainfall events of similar type in the same years. Consistency in simulated and observed flows was found with percent difference in volume ranging from -6.17 % to 5.47 % and percent difference in peak flows to be in the range of 6.96 % to 7.28 %. Values of Nash-Sutcliffe Efficiency were ranging from 0.299 to 0.909 with an average value of 0.586 for all flow events. The model was found well capable of capturing the hydrologic response of the catchment due to rainfall events and can be helpful in providing alerts of peak flows in real time based on real time/forecasted rainfall data.","[Shahid, Muhammad Adnan; Boccardo, Piero; Albanese, Adriana] Politecnico Torino, ITHACA Res Ctr, Turin, Italy; [Shahid, Muhammad Adnan] Univ Agr Faisalabad, Water Management Res Ctr, Faisalabad, Pakistan; [Usman, Muhammad] Tech Univ Dresden, Inst Groundwater Management, Fac Environm Sci, Dresden, Germany; [Usman, Muhammad; Qamar, Muhammad Uzair] Univ Agr Faisalabad, Fac Agri Engn & Technol, Dept Irrigat & Drainage, Faisalabad, Pakistan",,"Shahid, MA (corresponding author), Politecnico Torino, ITHACA Res Ctr, Turin, Italy.; Shahid, MA (corresponding author), Univ Agr Faisalabad, Water Management Res Ctr, Faisalabad, Pakistan.",m_adnanshahid@yahoo.com,"Usman, Muhammad/AAQ-8230-2020; BOCCARDO, PIERO/O-6359-2015","Usman, Muhammad/0000-0002-8058-6472; BOCCARDO, PIERO/0000-0003-4565-7332",Higher Education Commission (HEC) of PakistanHigher Education Commission of Pakistan,"This study was technically supported by ITHACA Research Center regarding TRMM satellite data processing and use.

Detailed assessment of temporal and spatial changes in erosion risk are key to forecasting pollutant dispersal, which affects water treatment costs and ecology. Outputs from scenario modeling of the River Derwent catchment, Yorkshire, indicate clear spatial and temporal trends in erosion risk. These trends are not picked up by using traditional methods, which rely on static land use maps. Using satellite-derived maps show that lower resolution traditional land-use maps relatively underestimate erosion risk in terms of location of source areas and seasonal variation in erosion risk. Seasonal variation in agricultural practices can be assessed by incorporating bare land variation into models, which show that erosion risk is relatively overestimated if all agricultural land is assumed to have the same character. Producing seasonal land use maps also allows the assessment of temporal variation in rainfall, which in combination with climate change projections allows for adaptable management plans. The bias in gradient in modeling, which assumes that high gradients result in greater sediment erosion risk, show that traditional models underestimate the contribution of erosion risk in lowland areas. This is compounded by the absence of artificial drainages in topographic rasters, which increases connectivity in lowland areas. By producing end member scenarios, model outputs help to inform where catchment management should be targeted, and whether seasonal interventions should be implemented. This information is vital to communicate with landowners when they implement catchment management practices, such as sediment traps and earth bunds. Adaption of erosion risk modeling practices is urgently needed in order to quantify the impact of artificial interference in which human activity disrupts 'natural' sediment source-to sink configurations, such as integrating new pathways and stores due to land use change and management. Furthermore, integrating higher resolution catchment modeling and improved seasonal forecasts of pollutant flux to oceans will permit more effective interventions. This paper highlights single output erosion risk maps are not effective to inform catchment management.","[Richardson, Janet Cristine; Hodgson, David Mark] Univ Leeds, Sch Earth & Environm, Stratig Grp, Leeds, W Yorkshire, England; [Kay, Paul] Univ Leeds, Sch Geog, Leeds, W Yorkshire, England; [Aston, Benjamin J.; Walker, Andrew C.] Yorkshire Water Clean Water & Catchment Strategy, Bradford, W Yorkshire, England",,"Richardson, JC (corresponding author), Univ Leeds, Sch Earth & Environm, Stratig Grp, Leeds, W Yorkshire, England.",J.C.Richardson@leeds.ac.uk,,"Hodgson, David/0000-0003-3711-635X; Aston, Benjamin/0000-0001-8340-7022",NERCUK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Natural Environment Research Council (NERC) [NE/R013012/1]; NERC Grant 'Yorkshire iCASP -Yorkshire Integrated Catchment Solutions Programme'UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Natural Environment Research Council (NERC) [NE/P011160/1],This work was funded under a NERC Industrial Mobility Fellowship to JR entitled 'An Integrated Approach to Assessing Catchment Resilience: Combining GIS and Field Data in Relation To Climate Change Projections in the River Derwent' (NERC Ref: NE/R013012/1).

In this study, the accuracy of four artificial intelligence (AI) methods, including the generalized regression neural network (GRNN), least-square support vector machine (LSSVM), group method of data handling (GMDH), and adaptive neuro-fuzzy inference systems with fuzzy C-means clustering (ANFIS-FCM), were investigated in forecasting the MSPI of three synoptic stations (Jolfa, Kerman, and Tehran) located in the arid-cold climate of Iran. The data used was monthly precipitation and belongs to a 30-year period (1988-2017). MSPI values were calculated in five time windows, including the following: 3-6 (MSPI3-6), 6-12 (MSPI6-12), 3-12 (MSPI3-12), 12-24 (MSPI12-24), and 24-48 (MSPI24-48). The period of 1988-2016 was considered for training (75%) and testing (25%), and 2017 (12 months) was used for long-term forecasting. The methods were evaluated by the root mean square error (RMSE), mean absolute error (MAE), Willmott index (WI), and Taylor diagram. In the short-term forecasting phase, results showed that the methods had their best performances in forecasting multivariate drought types of groundwater hydrologyeconomic-social (MSPI24-48), agricultural-groundwater hydrology (MSPI12-24), surface hydrology-agricultural (MSPI6-12), soil moisturesurface hydrology-agricultural (MSPI3-12), and soil moisture-surface hydrology (MSPI3-6), respectively. Also, among the mentioned methods, the weakest accuracy was reported for GRNN with an RMSE = 0.673, MAE = 0.499, and WI = 0.750 (related to MSPI3-6 of the Kerman station): the most accurate performance resulted from the GMDH with RMSE = 0.097, MAE = 0.074, and WI = 0.989 (related to MSPI24-48 of the Jolfa station). In spite of the acceptable performance of the models in short-term forecasting, by increasing the forecasting horizons, the models' errors were increased in the long-term forecasting phase. The models could have acceptable long-terns forecasts for just two months (or in some exceptional cases, three months) ahead. Further, according to the investigations, it can be shown that the methods show better performances in mountainous arid-cold regions, compared to desert arid-cold regions. As a theoretical study of multivariate drought forecasting, the AIs have promising results, and this research can be extended for the other regions.

Saline contamination in inland groundwater supplies is a concern for numerous communities in the southern US including the city of Deltona, Florida. Furthermore, conventional numerical tools for forecasting saltwater contamination are heavily dependent on reliable characterization of the physical characteristics of underlying aquifers, information that is often absent or challenging to obtain. To overcome these limitations, a reliable alternative data-driven model for forecasting salinity in a groundwater supply was developed for Deltona using the fast orthogonal search (FOS) method. FOS was applied on monthly water-demand data and corresponding chloride concentrations at water supply wells. Groundwater salinity measurements from Deltona water supply wells were applied to evaluate the forecasting capability and accuracy of the FOS model. Accurate and reliable groundwater salinity forecasting is necessary to support effective and sustainable coastal-water resource planning and management. The available (27) water supply wells for Deltona were randomly split into three test groups for the purposes of FOS model development and performance assessment. Based on four performance indices (RMSE, RSR, NSEC, and R), the FOS model proved to be a reliable and robust forecaster of groundwater salinity. FOS is relatively inexpensive to apply, is not based on rigorous physical characterization of the water supply aquifer, and yields reliable estimates of groundwater salinity in active water supply wells.","[El-Jaat, Majda; Hulley, Michael; Tetreault, Michel] Royal Mil Coll Canada, Kingston, ON, Canada",,"Hulley, M (corresponding author), Royal Mil Coll Canada, Kingston, ON, Canada.",michael.hulley@rmc.ca,,,Libyan Ministry of Higher Education and Scientific Research; Royal Military College of Canada's Academic Research Program,The authors wish to acknowledge that funding for this project was provided by the Libyan Ministry of Higher Education and Scientific Research under the supervision of the Canadian Bureau for International Education (CBIE) as well as by the Royal Military College of Canada's Academic Research Program.,,39,1,1,0,7,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"233 SPRING ST, NEW YORK, NY 10013 USA",1431-2174,1435-0157,,HYDROGEOL J,Hydrogeol.

Despite the scarce amount of rainfall (<20 mm/year) in the area and the limited recharge coming from the Andean highlands, this transboundary aquifer system has been overexploited mainly for agriculture since before the 2000s on the Peruvian side. Consequently, this has caused groundwater depletion and seawater intrusion. In this study, comprehensive hydrogeological information was integrated to understand the aquifer system's behavior and the effects to which it has been subjected to groundwater overexploitation. To that end, a 3D hydrogeological framework was developed using the LEAPFROG software and a constant-density groundwater flow model with equivalent heads was generated in FEFLOW software, which was adjusted with Monte Carlo analysis and conventional automated calibration. Finally, eight scenarios, considering various water resource management options proposed by the authority and potential climatic trends (CMIP6), were simulated from 2020 to 2040. The results showed that between 2002 and 2020, the increase in the seawater wedge and the average groundwater level decline were 216 hm3/year and 7 m, respectively. It is expected that the depletion will continue with a groundwater level decline between 5 and 8 m and an increase in the seawater wedge between 1120 hm3/year and 1175 hm(3)/year for the forecast period. The study concludes that the aquifer system will remain unsustainable for the next 20 years, regardless of the selected scenarios, and suggests that any mitigation measure requires the participation of stakeholders from Peru, Chile, and Bolivia.

For meeting the goal of flood and drought prevention, the nonlinear autoregressive with exogenous input (NARX) neural network is employed to bridge the data gap between the Gravity Recovery and Climate Experiment (GRACE) and GRACE Follow On (GRACE-FO) over Yangtze River Basin (YRB). The precipitation data from NASA Global Precipitation Measurement, temperature data from Global Historical Climatology Network and the Climate Anomaly Monitoring System, and terrestrial water storage anomalies (TWSA) from Global Land Data Assimilation System (GLDAS) are considered as the external inputs. Meanwhile, the performance of NARX models is evaluated for all possible combinations of time delays and neurons in order to find the optimal model structures. Then total storage deficit index (TSDI) is constructed based on TWSA reconstructions to assess drought and flood events over YRB, along with forecasting the extremes during the data gap period. The results show that when the number of time delays and neurons equals one and nine, respectively, the NARX model has an optimal performance with root mean square error (rmse), scaled rmse R*, Nash-Sutcliff Efficiency (NSE) and correlation coefficient r of 1.34 cm, 0.34, 0.95 and 0.94, respectively. As indicated by TSDI and comparisons with previous studies, YRB has switched from drought periods to increased flood risks with a moderate correlation to global warming and E1 Nino-Southern Oscillation (ENSO). Finally, the most important conclusion that we successfully predict the flood events during the data gap period suggests that NARX neural network is promising for forecasting short-term hydrological extremes over YRB.","[Wang, Jielong; Chen, Yi] Tongji Univ, Coll Surveying & Geoinformat, Shanghai 200092, Peoples R China; [Wang, Jielong; Chen, Yi] Cooperat Res Ctr Crustal Movement Observat Networ, Minist Educ, Shanghai 200092, Peoples R China",,"Wang, JL (corresponding author), Tongji Univ, Coll Surveying & Geoinformat, Shanghai 200092, Peoples R China.; Wang, JL (corresponding author), Cooperat Res Ctr Crustal Movement Observat Networ, Minist Educ, Shanghai 200092, Peoples R China.",wangjielong@tongji.edu.cn,,"Wang, Jielong/0000-0001-5754-2079",,,,56,0,0,20,20,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"ONE NEW YORK PLAZA, SUITE 4600, NEW YORK, NY, UNITED STATES",0921-030X,1573-0840,,NAT HAZARDS,Nat.

In September 2019, two focus groups were conducted with a sample (N = 14) of National Weather Service-Memphis' core partners to gauge perceptions about how the Weather Forecast Office provides technical information about flood risk patterns, paying particular attention to evaluations of its Mississippi River Outlook product. Research findings demonstrated that core partners may benefit from targeting risk information depending on partners' information needs and their technical knowledge/expertise. Similarly, the results suggested a need to offer context or interpretation for unique data points (e.g., gage tables, experimental forecasts, charts, and graphs) to successfully communicate important risk information and to clarify potential misunderstandings; this consideration was underscored by the finding that core partners tended to disseminate the Mississippi River Outlook product to others in the community (e.g., business owners; residents).

Although there is a general consensus that climate information can enhance hydrological predictability, this might not be the case if the accuracy of the given climate information is unreliable. Hence, this study has developed a modeling framework to estimate the role of climate information in forecasting accurate streamflow. Ensemble streamflow prediction (ESP) technology was adopted as a dynamic hydrologic forecast method to 35 watersheds in South Korea. The probabilistic precipitation forecast (PPF), issued by the Korea Meteorological Administration, was used as climate information for updating the probabilities of climate scenarios. First, we found that the current PPF is not accurate enough for significantly enhancing the streamflow forecasting accuracy. Subsequently, multiple sets of PPF were synthetically generated to evaluate the role of climate information. Given the perfect categorical climate forecasts, we found that there is much potential for the enhancement of streamflow forecast skill especially in the seasons that exhibit greater streamflow variability. However, there is less potential for increasing the streamflow forecasting skill under below-normal conditions. The proposed modeling framework is capable of quantifying the magnitude of potential improvement in hydrological predictability under the assumption that better climate information will be available in the future. We expect that this modeling framework can be effectively applied to other regions across a wide range of climate regimes.","[Seo, Seung Beom] Univ Seoul, Int Sch Urban Sci, Seoul 02504, South Korea; [Sung, Jang Hyun] Minist Environm, Han River Flood Control Off, Seoul 06501, South Korea",,"Sung, JH (corresponding author), Minist Environm, Han River Flood Control Off, Seoul 06501, South Korea.",jhsung1@korea.kr,,"Seo, Seung Beom/0000-0001-9819-6555",,,,49,0,0,2,7,SPRINGER WIEN,WIEN,"SACHSENPLATZ 4-6, PO BOX 89, A-1201 WIEN, AUSTRIA",0177-798X,1434-4483,,THEOR APPL CLIMATOL,Theor.

In this study, we compared two machine learning methods to predict water quality parameters, such as total nitrogen (TN), total phosphorus (TP), and turbidity (TUR), for 97 watersheds located in the Southeast Atlantic region of the USA. The modeling framework incorporates multiple climate and watershed variables (characteristics) that often control the water quality indicators in different landscapes. Three techniques, such as stepwise regression (SR), Least Absolute Shrinkage and Selection Operator (LASSO), and genetic algorithm (GA), are implemented to identify appropriate predictors out of 28 climate and catchment-related variables. The selected predictors were then used to develop the Random Forest (RF) and Boosted regression tree (BRT) models for water quality predictions in selected watersheds. The results highlighted that while both algorithms provided reasonable results (based on statistical metrics), the RF algorithm was easier to train and robust to model overfitting. Partial dependence plots highlighted the complex and nonlinear relationships between the individual predictors and the water quality indicators. The thresholds obtained from partial dependence plots showed that the median values of total nitrogen (TN) and total phosphorus (TP) in streams increase significantly when the percentage of urban and agricultural lands is above 40% and 43% of the watershed area, respectively. Furthermore, when soil hydraulic conductivity increases, the reduction in runoff results in decreased Turbidity levels in streams. Therefore, identifying the key watershed characteristics and their critical thresholds can help watershed managers create appropriate regulations for managing and sustaining healthy stream ecosystems. Besides, the forecasting models can improve water quality predictions in ungauged watersheds.","[Mishra, Ashok K.; Khan, Abdul A.] Clemson Univ, Glenn Dept Civil Engn, Clemson, SC 29634 USA; [Alnahit, Ali O.] King Saud Univ, Dept Civil Engn, Riyadh, Saudi Arabia",,"Mishra, AK (corresponding author), Clemson Univ, Glenn Dept Civil Engn, Clemson, SC 29634 USA.",ashokm@g.clemson.edu,,,Ministry of Education in Saudi Arabia,The authors would like to thank the Ministry of Education in Saudi Arabia for providing funding through a student scholarship.,,109,0,0,6,6,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"ONE NEW YORK PLAZA, SUITE 4600, NEW YORK, NY, UNITED STATES",1436-3240,1436-3259,,STOCH ENV RES RISK A,Stoch.

In field of hydrology, models for time series forecasting have been developed throughout the years, including the application of data-driven models. In this research, application of Artificial Intelligence (AI) technique in Support Vector Machine (SVM) method is used to forecast monthly discharge in Pemali River Basin, Indonesia. SVM method, optimized with fast messy genetic algorithm (fmGA), is employed for time series forecasting, whereas input data rely solely on previous values. Model performance is assessed with three different performance metrics and against Seasonal Autoregressive Moving Average (SARIMA) method for comparison. Scenarios are constructed with different input pattern for SVM to identify appropriate input data for giving good prediction accuracy. Input data are developed with and without selecting mechanism. Selecting mechanism is done based on assessment in Autocorrelation Function (ACF) coefficient of the time series data. While input data without the selecting mechanism consist of monthly discharge up to lag time 12 months prior (Q(t-1), Q(t-2), ... ,Q(t-12)). The result shows that input data with good correlation can give good prediction accuracy. Involvement of poorly correlated input data series may decrease model performance. However, with proper combination of input data, SVM can have good forecasting accuracy regardless of having the poorly correlated input data. Coherently, appropriate input data combination can reduce the number of support vectors in SVM, thus scaling down the risk of over fitting data.","[Christian, Kevin; Roy, Andreas F.

We simulate the Sesan, Srepok, and Sekong Rivers (3S), the most important tributaries of the lower Mekong River, with the Soil and Water Assessment Tool (SWAT) to investigate the implications of conversion of forest to agricultural lands. Multiple land use transitions in the 3S basin are projected using the Land Change Modeler. The uncertainty in land use projection was addressed using an ensemble forecasting approach for 2060, combining (a) three land demand scenarios, (b) two transition potential modeling approaches (i.e., approach to create maps of the likelihood for areas to transition from one land use type to another), and (c) retaining or not protected areas. Land demand leads to the greatest uncertainty in land use change projections. Transition potential modeling approaches do not make much difference in the total change, but can result in spatial variations of change. Retaining protected areas can contribute significantly to uncertainty in land use change projections. Decrease in annual streamflow of the 3S basin varied from 3% to 21%, and changes in annual sediment outflux from the basin ranged from -8% to 249% for simulated scenarios. Land use demand uncertainty results in the highest streamflow and sediment load changes and can thus have major consequences for water and sediment management strategies in areas undergoing rapid development.","[Shrestha, Bikesh; Cochrane, Thomas A.] Univ Canterbury, Dept Civil & Nat Resources Engn, Private Bag 4800, Christchurch, New Zealand; [Shrestha, Bikesh] Otago Reg Council, Dunedin 9016, New Zealand; [Caruso, Brian S.] US Fish & Wildlife Serv, Div Water Resources, Denver, CO 80228 USA; [Arias, Mauricio E.] Univ S Florida, Dept Civil & Environm Engn, Tampa, FL USA",,"Cochrane, TA (corresponding author), Univ Canterbury, Dept Civil & Nat Resources Engn, Private Bag 4800, Christchurch, New Zealand.",tom.cochrane@canterbury.ac.nz,"Arias, Mauricio/H-5667-2013","Arias, Mauricio/0000-0002-8805-6353; Cochrane, Thomas/0000-0001-9705-9807",John D. and Catherine T.

Forecasts of atmospheric rain-snow levels from December 2016 to March 2017, a period of active AR landfalls, are evaluated using 19 profiling radars in California. Three forecast model products are assessed: a global forecast model downscaled to 3-km grid spacing, 4-km river forecast center operational forecasts, and 50-km global ensemble reforecasts. Model forecasts of the rain-snow level are compared with observations of rain-snow melting-level brightband heights. Models produce mean bias magnitudes of less than 200 m across a range of forecast lead times. Error magnitudes increase with lead time and are similar between models, averaging 342 m for lead times of 24 h or less and growing to 700-800 m for lead times of greater than 144 h. Observed extremes in the rain-snow level are underestimated, particularly for warmer events, and the magnitude of errors increases with rain-snow level. Storms with high rain-snow levels are correlated with larger observed precipitation rates in Sierra Nevada watersheds. Flood risk increases with rain-snow levels, not only because a greater fraction of the watershed receives rain, but also because warmer storms carry greater water vapor and thus can produce heavier precipitation. The uncertainty of flood forecasts grows nonlinearly with the rain-snow level for these reasons as well. High rain-snow level ARs are a major flood hazard in California and are projected to be more prevalent with climate warming.","[Henn, Brian; Weihs, Rachel; Martin, Andrew C.; Ralph, F.

Water scarcity issues are being exacerbated by drought and population increases, making efficient water resource management in agricultural production increasingly important. The objective of this article is to evaluate the use of short-term weather forecasts for agricultural drought prediction. A crop-specific, linear regression drought analysis technique was used in this study. This study takes place in the upper Colorado River basin (UCRB) in west Texas. Five variables associated with agricultural drought (precipitation, temperature, biomass production, soil moisture depletion, and transpiration) were scaled and used to estimate cotton yields. The yield percentiles were used as a drought index. Precipitation and temperature were forecasted with a two-week lead time using probable scenarios based on historical data. The other three variables were estimated using the SWAT model. Forecasts were generated for each week of the growing season from 2010 through 2013. Four statistics were used to evaluate model performance, including the Nash-Sutcliffe coefficient of efficiency (NSE), the coefficient of determination (R-2), and two error indices, the percent bias (PBIAS) and the RMSE-observations standard deviation ratio (RSR). Comparing the variables using the forecasted weather data to those using the observed weather data revealed that four of the five performed satisfactorily. Temperature performed the best statistically, with an NSE of 0.85 and PBIAS of 9.4%. Precipitation (NSE = 0.51, PBIAS = -34%), cumulative biomass (NSE = 0.69, PBIAS = -38%), and transpiration (NSE = 0.53, PBIAS = 11%) also performed well. However, the soil moisture depletion forecasts (NSE = 0.28, PBIAS = 11%) were unsatisfactory. The forecasted cotton yield trends (NSE = 0.72, PBIAS = -12%) and drought index (NSE = 0.76, PBIAS = -13%) both performed satisfactorily, indicating that this forecasting method may be used for decision making related to agricultural water management, including irrigation timing.","[McDaniel, R.

It is highly associated with natural disasters, such as droughts and floods. Therefore, accurate streamflow forecasting is essential. Forecasting streamflow in general and monthly streamflow in particular is a complex process that cannot be handled by data-driven models (DDMs) only and requires pre-processing. Wavelet transformation is a pre-processing technique; however, application of continuous wavelet transformation (CWT) produces many scales that cause deterioration in the performance of any DDM because of the high number of redundant variables. This study proposes multigene genetic programming (MGGP) as a selection tool. After the CWT analysis, it selects important scales to be imposed into the artificial neural network (ANN). A basin located in the southeast of Turkey is selected as case study to prove the forecasting ability of the proposed model. One month ahead downstream flow is used as output, and downstream flow, upstream, rainfall, temperature, and potential evapotranspiration with associated lags are used as inputs. Before modeling, wavelet coherence transformation (WCT) analysis was conducted to analyze the relationship between variables in the time-frequency domain. Several combinations were developed to investigate the effect of the variables on streamflow forecasting. The results indicated a high localized correlation between the streamflow and other variables, especially the upstream. In the models of the standalone layout where the data were entered to ANN and MGGP without CWT, the performance is found poor. In the best-scale layout, where the best scale of the CWT identified as the highest correlated scale is chosen and enters to ANN and MGGP, the performance increased slightly. Using the proposed model, the performance improved dramatically particularly in forecasting the peak values because of the inclusion of several scales in which seasonality and irregularity can be captured. Using hydrological and meteorological variables also improved the ability to forecast the streamflow.","[Hadi, Sinan Jasim; Tombul, Mustafa] Anadolu Univ, Dept Civil Engn, Fac Engn, Eskisehir, Turkey",,"Hadi, SJ (corresponding author), Anadolu Univ, Dept Civil Engn, Fac Engn, Eskisehir, Turkey.",sinan.jasim@yahoo.com; mtombul@anadolu.edu.tr,"Hadi, Sinan Jasim/I-7552-2015","Hadi, Sinan Jasim/0000-0001-5580-0644",Anadolu UniversityAnadolu University [BAP-1604F165],The authors wish to thank Devlet SU Isleri (General Department of Water Affairs - Ministry of Forest and Water Affairs) and Devlet Meteroloji Isleri (General Department of Meteorological Affairs) for providing the data necessary to complete this work.

Any change in the inlet flow to the turbine will cause changes in the hydropower output. Therefore, the more accurately the flow is estimated, the hydropower generation is forecasted more accurately. In this research, a hydrological-neural network hybrid model for flow prediction is presented in which the Improved Sparrow Search Algorithm (ISSA) has been used. The results forecasting climate parameters showed that the average annual rainfall, runoff, and evaporation have a downward trend compared to the control period. The minimum and maximum annual temperatures have an increasing trend compared to the control period. To evaluate the hydropower generation Aras dam, the HEC-Ressim reservoir model is utilized. By comparing the average annual hydropower with the control period, it is known that the power generation will decrease in future years. The average annual electricity generated by hydropower under the scenario RCP2.6 and RCP4.5 and RCP8.5 in the next 50 years will decrease by approximately 3.36, 4.62, and 6.64 MW.","[Wang, Haizhen] Inner Mongolia Univ Nationalities, Coll Comp Sci & Technol, Tongliao 028000, Mongolia Autono, Peoples R China; [Wu, Xuerui] Chinese Acad Sci, Shanghai Astron Observ, Shanghai, Peoples R China; [Gholinia, Fatemeh] Univ Mohaghegh Ardabili, Ardebil, Ardabil Provinc, Iran",,"Wang, HZ (corresponding author), Inner Mongolia Univ Nationalities, Coll Comp Sci & Technol, Tongliao 028000, Mongolia Autono, Peoples R China.; Gholinia, F (corresponding author), Univ Mohaghegh Ardabili, Ardebil, Ardabil Provinc, Iran.",gongxiongtin@126.com; gholinia.f1989@gmail.com,,,,,,62,5,5,11,17,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",1532-0626,1532-0634,,CONCURR COMP-PRACT E,Concurr.

However, the absence of reliable estimates of the usual streamflow descriptors, at the considered time horizons, renders common input-output modeling approaches inapt for extended forecasting. For such a problem, system recurrence information is vital to produce relatively improved forecasts. Like any time series generated by complex systems, river flow can be represented by a time-varying parameter (TVP) model. TVP modeling frameworks often assume that the system evolution exhibits superstatistical random walks, and a number of statistical assumptions is followed upon, to infer better forecasts from the system. Also, the TVPs should hone a model's ability to capture system recurrence, which in this case translates to a number of state-based model structures. In this work, we develop an ensemble-based computationally efficient method that extracts useful cyclic-type TVPs which are strongly coupled over extended, but more continuous and less aggregated, time horizons. A multi-level modeling framework is proposed to facilitate the creation and direct use of updated parameter states to produce more reliable forecasts on the considered temporal resolutions. A dummy-variable optimization technique is also proposed within the state-updating procedure to allow smooth state transition. We show that the modeling framework produces stable results of parameter variations at different time horizons when applied to estimate the streamflow of Clearwater River. The proposed framework can incorporate exogenous descriptors at different levels without loss of generality and can be used for various forecasting applications.","[Alobaidi, Mohammad H.; Meguid, Mohamed A.] McGill Univ, Dept Civil Engn & Appl Mech, 817 Sherbrooke St West, Sherbrooke, PQ H3A 2K6, Canada; [Chebana, Fateh] Inst Natl Rech Sci, Eau Terre Environm, 490 Rue Couronne, Quebec City, PQ G1K 9A9, Canada",,"Alobaidi, MH (corresponding author), McGill Univ, Dept Civil Engn & Appl Mech, 817 Sherbrooke St West, Sherbrooke, PQ H3A 2K6, Canada.",mohammad.alobaidi@mail.mcgill.ca,"Alobaidi, Mohammad/ABA-9668-2020; Meguid, Mohamed/A-6003-2008","Meguid, Mohamed/0000-0002-5559-194X",,,,31,1,1,0,13,ELSEVIER,AMSTERDAM,"RADARWEG 29, 1043 NX AMSTERDAM, NETHERLANDS",0022-1694,1879-2707,,J HYDROL,J.

In this study, different models of static and dynamic artificial neural networks (ANN) including static feed forward neural network (FFNN), nonlinear autoregressive (NAR), and nonlinear autoregressive with exogenous inputs (NARX) are employed in order to forecast Sefidroud Dam reservoir inflows. The capability of studied networks with a range of different input variables in predicting reservoir inflows are then compared. All employed models are trained using inflow discharge and precipitation data with different time delays and an optimum number of neurons in the hidden layers are obtained. In addition, the time index (T) is also employed as the input data to the proposed models in order to increase the accuracy of the estimates. The obtained results indicate that NAR dynamic neural network has a better performance in comparison with FFNN and NARX models. Furthermore, using 12 time delays for inflow discharges and precipitation data leads to the best accessible results where adding time index (T) increases the accuracy. The results obtained from this study provide useful information for reservoir inflow simulation. In other words, these results are critical for water resources management and planning particularly in the field of dam reservoir operation which is crucial under reported water crisis in Iran.

Most of the existing research is focused on the trends of single hydrological and meteorological indicators. However, there is a lack of research on the cause analysis and scenario prediction of water resources vulnerability (WRV) in the three basins, which is the very important foundation for the management of water resources. First of all, based on the analysis of the causes of water resources vulnerability, this article set up the evaluation index system of water resource vulnerability from three aspects: water quantity, water quality and disaster. Then, we use the Improved Blind Deletion Rough Set (IBDRS) method to reduce the dimension of the index system, and we reduce the original 24 indexes to 12 evaluation indexes. Third, by comparing the accuracy of random forest (RF) and artificial neural network (ANN) models, we use the RF model with high fitting accuracy as the evaluation and prediction model. Finally, we use 12 evaluation indexes and an RF model to analyze the trend and causes of water resources vulnerability in three basins during 2000-2015, and further predict the scenarios in 2020 and 2030. The results show that the vulnerability level of water resources in the three basins has been improved during 2000-2015, and the three river basins should follow the development of scenario 1 to ensure the safety of water resources. The research proved that the combination of IBDRS and an RF model is a very effective method to evaluate and forecast the vulnerability of water resources in the Huang-Huai-Hai River Basin.","[Chen, Yan; Feng, Yazhong] Nanjing Forestry Univ, Coll Econ & Management, Nanjing 210037, Peoples R China; [Zhang, Fan] Louisiana State Univ, Ctr Agr, Sch Renewable Nat Resources, Baton Rouge, LA 70803 USA; [Yang, Fan] Monash Univ, Fac Business & Econ, Melbourne, Vic 3800, Australia; [Wang, Lei] Nanjing Univ Informat Sci & Technol, Teachers & Teaching Dev Ctr, Nanjing 210044, Peoples R China",,"Chen, Y (corresponding author), Nanjing Forestry Univ, Coll Econ & Management, Nanjing 210037, Peoples R China.",sanchen007@njfu.edu.cn; fengyazhong@njfu.edu.cn; fzhan14@lsu.edu; fyan0027@student.monash.edu; 001530@nuist.edu.cn,,,National Natural Foundation for young scholars [71403122]; Natural Foundation of Jiangsu Province for young scholars [BK20140980]; Humanities and Social Science Foundation of Chinese Ministry of Education for young scholars [14YJC630018],"This work was supported by the National Natural Foundation for young scholars (No. 71403122), the Natural Foundation of Jiangsu Province for young scholars (No. BK20140980), and the Humanities and Social Science Foundation of Chinese Ministry of Education for young scholars (No. 14YJC630018).",,57,4,5,9,20,MDPI,BASEL,"ST ALBAN-ANLAGE 66, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND",,1099-4300,,ENTROPY-SWITZ,Entropy,MAR,2020,22,3,,,,,,,333,10.3390/e22030333,,,23,"Physics, Multidisciplinary",Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),Physics,LE2AA,WOS:000526524300102,33286107,"gold, Green Published",,,2022-02-17

Extreme rainfall plays a key role in the occurrence of these hazards. Therefore, climate projection studies should focus more on extremes in order to provide a wider range of future scenarios of extremes which can aid policy decision making in African societies. Some researchers have attempted to analyze climate extremes through indices reflecting extremes in climate variables such as rainfall. However, it is difficult to assess impacts on stream-flow based on these indices alone, as most hydrological models require daily data as inputs. Others have analyzed climate projections through general circulation models (GCMs) but have found their resolution too coarse for regional studies. Dynamic downscaling using regional climate models (RCMs) seem to address the limitation of GCMs, although RCMs might still lack accuracy due to the fact that they also contain biases that need to be eliminated. Given these limitations, the current study combined both dynamic and statistical downscaling methods to correct biases and improve the reproduction of high extremes by the models. This study's aim was to analyze extreme high flows under the projection of extreme wet rainfall for the horizon of 2041 of a Kenyan South Coast catchment. The advanced delta change (ADC) method was applied on observed data (1982-2005), control (1982-2005) and near future (2018-2041) from an ensemble mean of multiple regional climate models (RCMs). The created future daily rainfall time series was introduced in the HEC-HMS (Hydrologic Engineering Center's Hydrologic Modeling System) hydrological model and the generated future flow were compared to the baseline flow at the gaging station 3KD06, where the observed flow was available. The findings suggested that in the study area, the RCMs, bias corrected by the ADC method, projected an increase in rainfall wet extremes in the first rainy season of the year MAMJ (March-April-May-June) and a decrease in the second rainy season OND (October-November-December). The changes in rainfall extremes, induced a similar change pattern in streamflow extremes at the gaging station 3KD06, meaning that an increase/decrease in rainfall extremes generated an increase/decrease in the streamflow extremes. Due to lack of long-term good quality data, the researchers decided to perform a frequency analysis for up to a 50 year return period in order to assess the changes induced by the ADC method. After getting a longer data series, further analysis could be done to forecast the maximum flow to up to 1000 years, which could serve as design flow for different infrastructure.","[Ouedraogo, Wendso Awa Agathe] Jomo Kenyatta Univ Agr & Technol, Inst Basic Sci Technol & Innovat, Pan African Univ, Civil Engn Dept, POB 62000-00200, Nairobi, Kenya; [Gathenya, John Mwangi; Raude, James Messo] Jomo Kenyatta Univ Agr & Technol, Soil Water & Environm Engn Dept, POB 62000-00200, Nairobi, Kenya",,"Ouedraogo, WAA (corresponding author), Jomo Kenyatta Univ Agr & Technol, Inst Basic Sci Technol & Innovat, Pan African Univ, Civil Engn Dept, POB 62000-00200, Nairobi, Kenya.",ouedraogo_agathe@yahoo.fr; j.m.gathenya@jkuat.ac.ke; ramesso@jkuatac.ke,"GATHENYA, JOHN/AAG-9550-2019","OUEDRAOGO, Agathe/0000-0002-9616-1153; GATHENYA, JOHN/0000-0003-1207-3242","Pan African University of Basic Sciences, Technology and Innovation (PAUSTI); NERCUK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Natural Environment Research Council (NERC) [NE/M008894/1] Funding Source: UKRI","This research was funded by the Pan African University of Basic Sciences, Technology and Innovation (PAUSTI).",,51,0,0,1,1,MDPI,BASEL,"ST ALBAN-ANLAGE 66, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND",,2306-5338,,HYDROLOGY-BASEL,Hydrology,SEP,2019,6,3,,,,,,,76,10.3390/hydrology6030076,,,26,Water Resources,Emerging Sources Citation Index (ESCI),Water Resources,JA8OT,WOS:000488111900020,,gold,,,2022-02-17

The conventional approach involves a postprocessor calibration strategy that first calibrates the hydrological model and then estimates errors. This procedure can simulate streamflow consistent with observations, but obtained parameters are not optimal. Joint calibration strategies address this issue by refining hydrological model parameters jointly with the autoregressive (AR) model. In this study, five alternative schemes are used to forecast floods. Scheme I uses only the hydrological model, while scheme II includes an AR model for error correction. In scheme III, differencing is used to remove non-stationarity in the error series. A joint inference strategy employed in scheme IV calibrates the hydrological and AR models simultaneously. The back-fitting algorithm, a basic approach for training an additive model, is adopted in scheme V to alternately recalibrate hydrological and AR model parameters. The performance of the five schemes is compared with a case study of 15 recorded flood events from China's Baiyunshan reservoir basin. Our results show that (1) schemes IV and V outperform scheme III during the calibration and validation periods and (2) scheme V is inferior to scheme IV in the calibration period, but provides better results in the validation period. Joint calibration strategies can therefore improve the accuracy of flood forecasting. Additionally, the back-fitting recalibration strategy produces weaker overcorrection and a more robust performance compared with the joint inference strategy.","[Zhang, Xiaojing; Liu, Pan; Cheng, Lei; Liu, Zhangjun; Zhao, Yan] Wuhan Univ, State Key Lab Water Resources & Hydropower Engn S, Wuhan 430072, Hubei, Peoples R China; [Zhang, Xiaojing; Liu, Pan; Cheng, Lei; Zhao, Yan] Hubei Prov Collaborat Innovat Ctr Water Resources, Wuhan 430072, Hubei, Peoples R China; [Zhao, Yan] Pearl River Hydraul Res Inst, Guangzhou 510610, Guangdong, Peoples R China",,"Liu, P (corresponding author), Wuhan Univ, State Key Lab Water Resources & Hydropower Engn S, Wuhan 430072, Hubei, Peoples R China.",liupan@whu.edu.cn,,,"National Key Research and Development Program [2016YFC0400907]; Innovative Research Groups of the Natural Science Foundation of Hubei, China [2017CFA015]; National Natural Science Foundation of ChinaNational Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC) [51579180]","This study was supported by the National Key Research and Development Program (2016YFC0400907), the Innovative Research Groups of the Natural Science Foundation of Hubei, China (2017CFA015) and the National Natural Science Foundation of China (51579180).

The Weather Research and Forecasting Hydrological model (WRF-Hydro) is a community-based hydrologic model designed to improve the skill of hydrometeorological forecasts, such as river discharge, through simulating hydrologic prognostic (e.g., soil moisture) and diagnostic (e.g., energy fluxes) variables. These quantities are potentially biased or erroneous due to the uncertainties involved in all layers of hydrologic predictions. In this study, we use an ensemble based Data Assimilation (DA) approach to explore the benefit of independently and jointly assimilating remotely sensed SMAP (Soil Moisture Active Passive) soil moisture (at different spatial resolutions) and USGS streamflow observations to improve the accuracy and reliability of WRF-Hydro model predictions while accounting for uncertainties. This study is conducted over a large region near to Houston, Texas where heavy rainfall from hurricane Harvey caused flooding in 2017. Before implementing DA, we first calibrated the WRF-Hydro model parameters using four United States Geological Survey (USGS) stream gauges installed within the watershed. In this step, we identified the most dominant model parameters, which were used later in the development of joint state-parameter DA. The findings of this study showed that the multivariate assimilation of soil moisture and streamflow observations results in improved prediction of stream flow as compared to univariate assimilation configurations and regardless of the watershed's streamflow regime. The results also revealed that, during the normal streamflow condition, assimilation of downscaled SMAP soil moisture at 1 km spatial resolution, would improve the accuracy of streamflow simulation more than the assimilation of coarse resolution products (i.e., the native SMAP at 36 km spatial resolution and its interpolated version at 9 km spatial resolution). However, during the period of hurricane Harvey, the soil moisture observations at different resolutions showed a similar impact on improving the streamflow prediction.","[Abbaszadeh, Peyman; Gavahi, Keyhan; Moradkhani, Hamid] Univ Alabama, Ctr Complex Hydrosyst Res, Dept Civil Construct & Environm Engn, Tuscaloosa, AL 35487 USA",,"Abbaszadeh, P (corresponding author), Univ Alabama, Ctr Complex Hydrosyst Res, Dept Civil Construct & Environm Engn, Tuscaloosa, AL 35487 USA.",pabbaszadeh@crimson.ua.edu,"Gavahi, Keyhan/AAB-2369-2021; Moradkhani, Hamid/B-1571-2012","Gavahi, Keyhan/0000-0002-1313-2286; Moradkhani, Hamid/0000-0002-2889-999X",,,,66,15,15,8,28,ELSEVIER SCI LTD,OXFORD,"THE BOULEVARD, LANGFORD LANE, KIDLINGTON, OXFORD OX5 1GB, OXON, ENGLAND",0309-1708,1872-9657,,ADV WATER RESOUR,Adv.

Whilst this creates new opportunities for improving the performance of water resources systems, there may also be associated risks. Here, we explore these potential risks by examining the sensitivity of forecast value (improvement in system performance brought about by adopting forecasts) to changes in the forecast skill for a range of hypothetical reservoir designs with contrasting operating objectives. Forecast-informed operations are simulated using rolling horizon, adaptive control and then benchmarked against optimised control rules to assess performance improvements. Results show that there exists a strong relationship between forecast skill and value for systems operated to maintain a target water level. But this relationship breaks down when the reservoir is operated to satisfy a target demand for water; good forecast accuracy does not necessarily translate into performance improvement. We show that the primary cause of this behaviour is the buffering role played by storage in water supply reservoirs, which renders the forecast superfluous for long periods of the operation. System performance depends primarily on forecast accuracy when critical decisions are made - namely during severe drought. As it is not possible to know in advance if a forecast will perform well at such moments, we advocate measuring the consistency of forecast performance, through bootstrap resampling, to indicate potential usefulness in storage operations. Our results highlight the need for sensitivity assess-ment in value-of-forecast studies involving reservoirs with supply objectives.","[Turner, Sean W.

The framework was tested in five sub-basins of Huaihe River of China, namely Upstream of Huaihe River (UH), Middlestream of Huaihe River (MH), Downstream of Huaihe River (DH), Yishusi River (YSSR), and Coastal River of Shandong Peninsula (CSP) to project future changes in industrial water demand under different environment change scenarios. Results showed that industrial water demand in Huaihe River basin will increase in the range of 10 to 44.6% due to economic development, water-saving technological advances, and climate change. The highest increase was projected by general circulation model (GCM) BCC-CSM1-1 (179.16 x 108 m(3)) and the lowest by GCM GISS-E2-R (132.4 x 10(8) m(3)) in 2020, while the GCM BNU-ESM projected the highest increase (190.57 x 10(8) m(3)) and GCM CNRM-CM5 the lowest (160.41 x 10(8) m(3)) in 2030. Among the different sub-basins, the highest increase was projected in MH sub-basin where industrial water demand is already very high. On the other hand, the lowest increase in industrial water demand was projected in UH sub-basin. The rapid growth of high water-consuming industries and increased water demand for cooling due to temperature rise are the major causes of the sharp increase in industrial water demand in the basin. The framework developed in the study can be used for reliable forecasting of industrial water demand which in turn can help in selection of an appropriate water management strategy for adaptation to global environmental changes.","[Wang, Xiao-jun; Zhang, Jian-yun] Nanjing Hydraul Res Inst, State Key Lab Hydrol Water Resources & Hydraul En, Nanjing 210029, Jiangsu, Peoples R China; [Wang, Xiao-jun; Zhang, Jian-yun] Minist Water Resources, Res Ctr Climate Change, Nanjing 210029, Jiangsu, Peoples R China; [Wang, Xiao-jun] Beijing Normal Univ, Sch Environm, State Key Lab Water Environm Simulat, Beijing 100875, Peoples R China; [Shahid, Shamsuddin] Univ Teknol Malaysia, Fac Civil Engn, Johor Baharu 81310, Malaysia; [Bi, Shou-hai] Minist Water Resources, Dept Water Resources, Beijing 100053, Peoples R China; [Elmahdi, Amgad] Bur Meteorol, Urban Water Balance Climate & Water Div, Melbourne, Vic 3008, Australia; [Liao, Chuan-hua] Nanjing Tech Univ, Nanjing 211800, Jiangsu, Peoples R China; [Li, You-de] Huaihe River Water Resources Commiss, Beijing 233001, Peoples R China",,"Wang, XJ (corresponding author), Nanjing Hydraul Res Inst, State Key Lab Hydrol Water Resources & Hydraul En, Nanjing 210029, Jiangsu, Peoples R China.; Wang, XJ (corresponding author), Minist Water Resources, Res Ctr Climate Change, Nanjing 210029, Jiangsu, Peoples R China.; Wang, XJ (corresponding author), Beijing Normal Univ, Sch Environm, State Key Lab Water Environm Simulat, Beijing 100875, Peoples R China.",xjwang@nhri.cn,"FKA, SHAMSUDDIN SHAHID/B-5185-2010","FKA, SHAMSUDDIN SHAHID/0000-0001-9621-6452; Elmahdi, Amgad/0000-0002-9420-6581","National Natural Science Foundation of ChinaNational Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC) [51309155, 41330854]; Strategic Consulting Projects of Chinese Academy of Engineering [2016-ZD-08-05-02]; China water resource fee funded project [126302001000150001]; National Basic Research Program of ChinaNational Basic Research Program of China [2010CB951104, 2010CB951103]; Open Research Fund of State Key Laboratory of Simulation and Regulation of Water Cycle in River Basin China Institute of Water Resources and Hydropower Research [IWHR-SKL-201515]; Special Fund of State Key Laboratory of China [Y515023, Y513004]","We are grateful to the National Natural Science Foundation of China (No. 51309155, 41330854), Strategic Consulting Projects of Chinese Academy of Engineering (NO: 2016-ZD-08-05-02), China water resource fee funded project (No. 126302001000150001), National Basic Research Program of China (No. 2010CB951104 and 2010CB951103), Open Research Fund of State Key Laboratory of Simulation and Regulation of Water Cycle in River Basin China Institute of Water Resources and Hydropower Research) (NO: IWHR-SKL-201515) and the Special Fund of State Key Laboratory of China (No. Y515023 and Y513004) for providing financial support for this research.

If not treated to an acceptable level, microbial pathogens present in the drinking water can result in severe consequences for public health. The aim of this paper was to evaluate the suitability of data-driven models of different complexity for predicting the concentrations of E. coli in the river Gota lilv at the water intake of the drinking water treatment plant in Gothenburg, Sweden. The objectives were to (i) assess how the complexity of the model affects the model performance; and (ii) identify relevant factors and assess their effect as predictors of E. coli levels. To forecast E. coli levels one day ahead, the data on laboratory measurements of E. coli and total coliforms, Colifast measurements of E. coli, water temperature, turbidity, precipitation, and water flow were used. The baseline approaches included Exponential Smoothing and ARIMA (Autoregressive Integrated Moving Average), which are commonly used univariate methods, and a naive baseline that used the previous observed value as its next prediction. Also, models common in the machine learning domain were included: LASSO (Least Absolute Shrinkage and Selection Operator) Regression and Random Forest, and a tool for optimising machine learning pipelines - TPOT (Tree-based Pipeline Optimization Tool). Also, a multivariate autoregressive model VAR (Vector Autoregression) was included. The models that included multiple predictors performed better than univariate models. Random Forest and TPOT resulted in higher performance but showed a tendency of overfitting. Water temperature, microbial concentrations upstream and at the water intake, and precipitation upstream were shown to be important predictors. Data-driven modelling enables water producers to interpret the measurements in the context of what concentrations can be expected based on the recent historic data, and thus identify unexplained deviations warranting further investigation of their origin.

Observations and models of lake carbon pools and fluxes are rarely explicitly combined through data assimilation despite successful use of this technique in other fields. Data assimilation adds value to both observations and models by constraining models with observations of the system and by leveraging knowledge of the system formalized by the model to objectively fill observation gaps. In this article, we highlight the utility of data assimilation in lake carbon cycling research by using the ensemble Kalman filter to combine simple lake carbon models with observations of lake carbon pools and fluxes. We demonstrate that data assimilation helps reduce uncertainty in estimates of lake carbon pools and fluxes and more accurately estimate the true carbon pool size compared to estimates derived from observations alone. Data assimilation techniques should be embraced as valuable tools for lake biogeochemists interested in learning about ecosystem dynamics and forecasting ecosystem states and processes.","[Zwart, Jacob A.] US Geol Survey, Integrated Informat Disseminat Div, Middleton, WI 53562 USA; [Hararuk, Oleksandra] McGill Univ, Dept Nat Resource Sci, Montreal, PQ, Canada; [Hararuk, Oleksandra; Solomon, Christopher T.] Cary Inst Ecosyst Studies, Millbrook, NY USA; [Prairie, Yves T.] Univ Quebec Montreal, Dept Sci Biol, Montreal, PQ, Canada; [Jones, Stuart E.] Univ Notre Dame, Dept Biol Sci, Notre Dame, IN 46556 USA",,"Zwart, JA (corresponding author), US Geol Survey, Integrated Informat Disseminat Div, Middleton, WI 53562 USA.",jayzlimno@gmail.com,"Jones, Stuart/ABD-5264-2021; Prairie, Yves T./B-9108-2008; Hararuk, Oleksandra/V-6628-2019; Solomon, Christopher/E-6284-2014","Jones, Stuart/0000-0003-4740-6721; Prairie, Yves T./0000-0003-1210-992X; Hararuk, Oleksandra/0000-0001-5694-6813; Zwart, Jacob/0000-0002-3870-405X; Solomon, Christopher/0000-0002-2850-4257",Fonds de Recherche du Quebec Nature et Technologies [FRQNT 191167]; National Science FoundationNational Science Foundation (NSF) [NSF DGE-1313583]; NSF Earth Sciences Postdoctoral Fellowship under NSFNational Science Foundation (NSF) [EAR-PF-1725386]; NSFNational Science Foundation (NSF) [DEB-1547866],"We thank the University of Notre Dame, Environmental Research Center for hosting our study.

In general, the existing water quality prediction methods are based on a single shallow model which fails to capture the long-term dependence in historical time series and is more likely to cause a high rate of false alarms and false negatives in practical water monitoring application. To resolve these problems, a new model combining recurrent neural network (RNN) with improved Dempster/Shafer (D-S) evidence theory (RNNs-DS) is proposed in this paper. Among them, the RNNs which can handle the long-term dependence in historical time series effectively are used to realize the preliminary prediction of water quality. And the improved D-S evidence theory is used to synthesize the prediction results of RNNs. In addition, an improved strategy based on correlation analysis method is presented for evidence theory to obtain the number of evidence, which reduces uncertainty in evidence selection effectively. Besides, a new basic probability assignment function which based on modified softmax function is proposed. The new function can effectively solve the problems of weight allocation failure in the traditional function. Then, data about permanganate index, pH, total phosphorus, and dissolved oxygen from Jiuxishuichang monitoring station near Qiantang River, Zhejiang Province, China is used to verify the proposed model. Compared with support vector regression (SVR) and backpropagation neural network (BPNN) and three RNN models, the new model shows higher accuracy and better stability as indicated by four indices. Finally, the engineering application of the RNNs-DS algorithm has been realized on the self-developed water environmental monitoring and forecasting system, which can provide effective support for early risk assessment and prevention in water environment.","[Li, Lei; Jiang, Peng; Xu, Huan] Hangzhou Dianzi Univ, Coll Automat, Hangzhou 310018, Zhejiang, Peoples R China; [Lin, Guang] Zhejiang Prov Environm Monitoring Ctr, Hangzhou, Zhejiang, Peoples R China; [Guo, Dong] Zhejiang Univ Water Resources & Elect Power, Coll Elect Engn, Hangzhou 310018, Zhejiang, Peoples R China; [Wu, Hui] Fuzhou Fuguang Water Technol Co Ltd, Fuzhou, Fujian, Peoples R China",,"Jiang, P (corresponding author), Hangzhou Dianzi Univ, Coll Automat, Hangzhou 310018, Zhejiang, Peoples R China.",leelei912@126.com; pjiang@hdu.edu.cn; xuhuan@hdu.edu.cn; 13336167533@189.cn; Guod@zjweu.edu.com; wuhui@fuguang.com,,,International Science and Technology Cooperation Program of Zhejiang Province for Joint Research in High-tech Industry [2016C54007]; National Key R&D Program of China [2016YFC0201400]; Leading Talents of Science and Technology Innovation in Zhejiang Provincial Ten Thousands Plan [2019R52040]; Provincial Key R&D Program of Zhejiang Province [2017C03019]; National Natural Science Foundation of ChinaNational Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC); Zhejiang Joint Fund for Integrating of Informatization and Industrialization [U1509217],"This study is supported by International Science and Technology Cooperation Program of Zhejiang Province for Joint Research in High-tech Industry (No. 2016C54007), National Key R&D Program of China (No. 2016YFC0201400), Leading Talents of Science and Technology Innovation in Zhejiang Provincial Ten Thousands Plan (No. 2019R52040), Provincial Key R&D Program of Zhejiang Province (No. 2017C03019) and National Natural Science Foundation of China and Zhejiang Joint Fund for Integrating of Informatization and Industrialization (No. U1509217).",,58,29,32,3,62,SPRINGER HEIDELBERG,HEIDELBERG,"TIERGARTENSTRASSE 17, D-69121 HEIDELBERG, GERMANY",0944-1344,1614-7499,,ENVIRON SCI POLLUT R,Environ.

However, research efforts are still needed for an effective development of assimilation schemes suitable for operational usage, especially in case of distributed hydrologic models. This work presents a new assimilation system of streamflow data from multiple locations in a distributed hydrologic model. The system adopts a mixed variational-Monte Carlo approach, and is here tested with the hydrologic model MOBIDIC, that is part of the operational flood forecasting chain for Arno river in central Italy. The main objective of the work is to evaluate the actual gain that the system can lead to flood predictions in a real-time operational usage. Accordingly, a specifically designed assessment strategy is employed. It is based on several hindcast experiments that include both high flow and false alarm events in the period 2009-2014 in Arno river basin. Results show that the assimilation system can significantly increase the accuracy of flow predictions in respect to open loop simulations in both cases. Specific performances depend on location and event, but in the majority of cases the error on predicted peak flow is reduced of more than 50% with a lead time of around 10 h. The analysis reveals also that the structure of the hydrologic model, the coherence between observations at various sites, and the initial watershed saturation level, considerably affect the obtainable performances. Conditions that may lead to a worsening of open loop predictions are identified and discussed.","[Ercolani, Giulia; Castelli, Fabio] Univ Florence, Dept Civil & Environm Engn, Florence, Italy",,"Ercolani, G (corresponding author), Univ Florence, Dept Civil & Environm Engn, Florence, Italy.",giulia.ercolani@dicea.unifi.it,,,Tuscany RegionRegione Toscana [CUP-B18C12000300002],"Authors acknowledge Tuscany Region for supporting the research.

Effectively predicting water temperature is a key issue related to environment management. This study develops a probabilistic model based on C-vine copulas for water temperature prediction. The proposed framework is applied to forecast daily water temperature in the Yangtze River, considering long-term effects of preceding air temperature and daily discharge. The prediction performance of this framework is compared with the logistic regression model (LogR) and generalized regression neural network (GRNN). The results of this study indicate that the proposed C-vine copula framework and GRNN model provide better forecasting of stream temperature with weak human-related disturbances than LogR model. The outperformance of C-vine framework is reflected by its ability to accurately capture variations in the water temperature greatly affected by the Three Gorges Reservoir (TGR). This steady and reliable framework is further applied for the conservation of Chinese Sturgeon to estimate the range of suggested discharge, given the daily air temperatures, to adjust the water temperature within 18-20 degrees C at Yichang station during the spawning season. This application is verified to be more effective, providing indications for reservoir management to lower water temperatures by regulating river flow to ensure the occurrence of spawning activities.

Observational analyses and model experiments show that prolonged shortages of water supply in the Colorado River are significantly linked to sea surface temperature precursors including tropical Pacific cooling, North Pacific warming, and southern tropical Atlantic warming. In the Colorado River basin, the water deficits can reduce crop yield and increase wildfire potential. Thus, a multi-year prediction of severe water shortages in the Colorado River basin could be useful as an early indicator of subsequent agricultural loss and wildfire risk. Sea surface temperature anomalies in the Atlantic and Pacific Oceans can help predict water shortages in the Colorado River basin, according to analyses of decadal climate predictions and observations.","[Chikamoto, Yoshimitsu; Wang, S-Y Simon; Yost, Matt; Gillies, Robert R.] Utah State Univ, Dept Plants Soils & Climate, 4820 Old Main Hill, Logan, UT 84322 USA; [Chikamoto, Yoshimitsu; Wang, S-Y Simon; Gillies, Robert R.] Utah State Univ, Utah Climate Ctr, Logan, UT 84322 USA; [Yocom, Larissa] Utah State Univ, Dept Wildland Resources, Logan, UT 84322 USA",,"Chikamoto, Y (corresponding author), Utah State Univ, Dept Plants Soils & Climate, 4820 Old Main Hill, Logan, UT 84322 USA.; Chikamoto, Y (corresponding author), Utah State Univ, Utah Climate Ctr, Logan, UT 84322 USA.",yoshi.chikamoto@usu.edu,,"Chikamoto, Yoshimitsu/0000-0003-1001-5188","Utah Agricultural Experiment Station, Utah State University; U.S. Department of Interior, Bureau of Reclamation [R18AC00018, R19AP00149]; Strategic Environmental Research and Development Program [RC20-3056]; US Department of EnergyUnited States Department of Energy (DOE) [DESC0016605]; Utah State University Extension","Y.C., S-Y.S.W., L.Y., M.Y., and R.R.G. were supported by the Utah Agricultural Experiment Station, Utah State University (approved as journal paper number 9378).

Risk analysis models that neglect such dependences potentially yield biased results regarding flood control operations. To enhance the accuracy of flood risk analysis and inform decision making regarding real-time flood control for a multireservoir system, this study proposed an integrated flood risk identification, analysis, and diagnosis model framework that incorporates the multidimensional dependences of forecast uncertainties. The framework includes an uncertainty identification model that uses the copula function to characterize the joint probability function of the mixed dependent uncertainties. It also incorporates a realtime flood risk analysis module that couples simulation and optimization to convert the complex multiobjective operation under uncertainty into a tractable model capable of flexibly evaluating individual and joint flood risks. The third component is a risk diagnosis module that calculates risk contributions using conditional probability, and identifies stable and vulnerable reservoirs within the system to alter operational decisions toward risk reduction. Methodologies were verified through application to a mixed four-reservoir system in the Pi River Basin, China. The principal findings were as follows. (1) Positive-dominated dependences of forecast uncertainties were identified because of error propagation through the meteorological and rainfall-runoff forecasts within the spatial and temporal continuity connection, and the copula function accurately described and quantified the multidimensional temporal and spatial dependences of the uncertainties. (2) In neglecting the spatial dependences of forecast uncertainties, the joint flood risk of the reservoir system was underestimated; in ignoring high-order temporal dependences, individual flood risk was underestimated owing to biased estimation in error variance. (3) Systematic reorganization of the operational strategies of diagnosed stable and vulnerable reservoirs could provide guidance for reduction and homogenization of flood risks. The proposed framework could be used to improve the accuracy of flood risk analysis and support reliable real-time flood control operation of a multireservoir system.","[Xu, Bin; Huang, Xin; Mo, Ran; Zhong, Ping-an; Lu, Qingwen; Si, Wei; Sun, Yu] Hohai Univ, Coll Hydrol & Water Resources, 1 Xikang Rd, Nanjing 210098, Peoples R China; [Xu, Bin] Nanjing Hydraul Res Inst, State Key Lab Hydrol Water Resources & Hydraul En, 223 Guangzhou Rd, Nanjing 210029, Peoples R China; [Zhang, Hanwen] Shanghai Invest Design & Res Inst Co Ltd, 388 Yixian Rd, Shanghai 200434, Peoples R China; [Xiao, Jianfeng] Minist Water Resources, Huaihe River Commiss, 3055 Donghai Rd, Bengbu 233001, Peoples R China",,"Xu, B (corresponding author), Hohai Univ, Coll Hydrol & Water Resources, 1 Xikang Rd, Nanjing 210098, Peoples R China.",xubin_hhu@hhu.edu.cn; xinhuang@hhu.edu.cn; hhuhazardmo@163.com; zhongpa_hhu@163.com; luqw@hhu.edu.cn; zhang_hanwen@foxmail.com; lindongsisi@163.com; jfxiao@hrc.gov.cn; 842004694@qq.com,,,"National Key Technologies R&D Program of ChinaNational Key Technology R&D Program [2016YFC0400909]; Fundamental Research Funds for the Central UniversitiesFundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities [B200202028, B200204038]; China Postdoctoral Science Foundation Funded ProjectChina Postdoctoral Science Foundation [2018 T110525]; Qing Lan Project of Jiangsu Province","This study is supported by National Key Technologies R&D Program of China (Grant No. 2016YFC0400909), the Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities (Grant No. B200202028, B200204038), the China Postdoctoral Science Foundation Funded Project (Grant No. 2018 T110525), and Qing Lan Project of Jiangsu Province.

ANN model was used in this study is based on the long period forecasting of daily groundwater tables. ANN models were carried out to predict groundwater tables for 1 day ahead at two different geological materials. The input to the ANN models consider of daily rainfall, river stage, water level, stream flow rate, temperature and groundwater level. Two different type of ANNs structure were used to predict the fluctuation of groundwater tables and compared the best forecasting values. The performance of different models structure of the ANN is used to identify the fluctuation of the groundwater table and provide acceptable predictions. Dynamics prediction and time series of the system can be implemented in two possible ways of modelling. The coefficient correlation (R), Mean Square Error (MSE), Root Mean Square Error (RMSE) and coefficient determination (R-2) were chosen as the selection criteria of the best model.

Based on these results, it clearly shows that accurate predictions can be achieved with time series 1-day ahead of forecasting groundwater table and the interaction between river and aquifer can be examine.

However, improving the accuracy of seasonal forecasting remains a challenge. In this study, a statistical model and four dynamical global circulation models (GCMs) are applied to conduct seasonal rainfall forecasts for the Yangtze River basin. The statistical forecasts are achieved by establishing a linear regression relationship between the sea surface temperature (SST) and rainfall. The dynamical forecasts are achieved by downscaling the rainfall predicted by the four GCMs at the monthly and seasonal scales. Historical data of monthly SST and GCM hindcasts from 1982 to 2010 are used to make the forecast. The results show that the SST-based statistical model generally outperforms the GCM simulations, with higher forecasting accuracy that extends to longer lead times of up to 12 months. The SST statistical model achieves a correlation coefficient up to 0.75 and the lowest mean relative error of 6%. In contrast, the GCMs exhibit a sharply decreasing forecast accuracy with lead times longer than 1 month. Accordingly, the SST statistical model can provide reliable guidance for the seasonal rainfall forecasts in the Yangtze River basin, while the results of GCM simulations could serve as a reference for shorter lead times. Extensive scope exists for further improving the rainfall forecasting accuracy of GCM simulations.","[Qian, Shuni; Chen, Jie; Li, Xiangquan; Xu, Chong-Yu; Guo, Shenglian; Chen, Hua; Wu, Xushu] Wuhan Univ, State Key Lab Water Resources & Hydropower Engn S, Wuhan 430072, Hubei, Peoples R China; [Chen, Jie] Wuhan Univ, Hubei Prov Key Lab Water Syst Sci Sponge City Con, Wuhan, Hubei, Peoples R China; [Xu, Chong-Yu] Univ Oslo, Dept Geosci, Oslo, Norway",,"Chen, J (corresponding author), Wuhan Univ, State Key Lab Water Resources & Hydropower Engn S, Wuhan 430072, Hubei, Peoples R China.",jiechen@whu.edu.cn,"Xu, Chong-Yu/B-2941-2012; Chen, hua/AAN-1532-2020","Xu, Chong-Yu/0000-0003-4826-5350; Guo, shenglian/0000-0002-8594-4988; Qian, Shuni/0000-0002-1697-4542","National Natural Science Foundation of ChinaNational Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC) [51539009, 51779176]; Overseas Expertise Introduction Project for Discipline Innovation (111 Project) [B18037]; Thousand Youth Talents Plan from the Organization Department of CCP Central Committee","National Natural Science Foundation of China, Grant/Award Numbers: 51539009, 51779176; Overseas Expertise Introduction Project for Discipline Innovation (111 Project), Grant/Award Number: B18037; Thousand Youth Talents Plan from the Organization Department of CCP Central Committee",,61,6,6,9,68,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0899-8418,1097-0088,,INT J CLIMATOL,Int.

The most visible affect of the present climate change is the rise of surface air temperature. Regional and local indicators of climate change differ from the global characteristics. Transformation of the hydrological cycle, water balance, river runoff in its turn affects climate processes. In order to predict the response of geosystems and their hydro-climatic resources to climate change it is necessary to have a clear vision of contemporary climate change and its projections for the coming decades in specific geographical localities. The aim of the study is (1) to assess the climate change over West Siberia on the basis of statistical analysis of monthly air temperature and precipitation time series up to 2015, (2) predict the average air temperature and precipitation fields for the 2021-2030, and (3) determine the climate-driven changes in water balance and water flow regime over the study area. The methods used in the study. Analysis and forecasting of spatial and temporal variability of surface air temperature and precipitation rates at meteorological stations in the region are made by statistical methods in the StatSoft STATISTICA package (regression analysis, trend analysis, cluster analysis to classify objects, exponential smoothing and forecasting). The averaged monthly land water balance constituents are determined for the base (1966-1985), current (1986-2015) and forecast (2021-2030) using the method of hydrological and climatical calculations developed by V.S. Mezentsev. The results. It is shown that the modern 30yrs climatic period differs from the previous one in higher energy level (air temperature). Against this background, not only upward but downward temperature trends in some months are observed. The authors have predicted the average temperatures and precipitation rates in a cold season and monthly temperatures and precipitation in a warm season of the year at 31 meteorological stations for 2021-2030. The estimates for the current and forecast periods made it possible to compute the average regime parametres of precipitation, evapotranspiration, runoff and moisture of soil active layer at the meteorological stantions located in different lanscape zones and regions of West Siberian plain. The projected increase in temperature and evapotranspiration does not lead to the expected decrease in flow even in the southern dry regions. At the same time, soil moisture in summer will decrease everywhere.","[Paromov, Vladimir V.; Zemtsov, Valery A.; Kopysov, Sergey G.] Natl Res Tomsk State Univ, 36 Lenin Ave, Tomsk 634050, Russia; [Kopysov, Sergey G.] RAS, SB, Inst Monitorig Climat Condit & Ecol Syst, 10-3 Akad Prospect, Tomsk 634055, Russia",,"Paromov, VV (corresponding author), Natl Res Tomsk State Univ, 36 Lenin Ave, Tomsk 634050, Russia.",pvv0266@mail.ru; zemtsov_v@mail.ru; wosypok@mail.ru,"Zemtsov, Valeriy A/D-3106-2013; Paromov, Vladimir/N-8046-2014; Paromov, Vladimir/M-5811-2019","Zemtsov, Valeriy A/0000-0002-9376-1073; ",RFBR grantRussian Foundation for Basic Research (RFBR) [14-05-00700]; Government of the RF [220]; Ministry of Education and Science of the RF [14B25.31.0001],"The research was financially supported by the RFBR grant 14-05-00700 and the grant by order of the Government of the RF no. 220,09 April 2010, by the agreement with the Ministry of Education and Science of the RF no. 14B25.31.0001, 24 June 2013 (BIO-GEO-CLIM).",,33,9,9,0,2,"TOMSK POLYTECHNIC UNIV, PUBLISHING HOUSE",TOMSK,"30, LENIN AVE, TOMSK, 634050, RUSSIA",2500-1019,2413-1830,,BULL TOMSK POLYTECH,Bull.

In this study, the forecasting capacity of the WPSH for summer rainfall and streamflow is evaluated based on the WPSH index (WPSHI) derived from the NCEP/NCAR reanalysis dataset. It has been found that WPSHI can identify extreme flood years with a higher skill than normal wet years. Specifically, exceedance probability forecasting based on WPSHI has higher skills for higher thresholds of rainfall. For streamflow, adding WPSHI as a predictor only enhances the skill for higher thresholds of streamflow relative to models based on antecedent streamflow. Under the same framework, performances of two postprocessing approaches for dynamical forecasts, i.e., the model output statistics (MOS) approach and the reanalysis-based (RAN) approach are compared. Hindcasts from Climate Forecast System version 2 from the National Center for Environmental Prediction (CFSv2) are used to calculate WPSHI, which is used as the predictor for rainfall and streamflow. The result shows that the RAN approach performs better than the MOS approach. This study emphasizes the fact that the forecasting skill of exceedance probability would largely depend on the selected threshold of the predictand, and this fact should be noticed in future studies in the long-term forecasting field.","[He, Ranran; Chen, Yuanfang; Huang, Qin; Wang, Wenpeng; Li, Guofang] Hohai Univ, Coll Hydrol & Water Resources, Nanjing 210098, Peoples R China; [He, Ranran] Bengbu Univ, Coll Civil Engn, Bengbu 233030, Peoples R China",,"Chen, YF (corresponding author), Hohai Univ, Coll Hydrol & Water Resources, Nanjing 210098, Peoples R China.",heranran2006@163.com; chenyuanfang@hhu.edu.cn; hqhhu@outlook.com; wangwenpeng@hhu.edu.cn; liguofang@hhu.edu.cn,,,"National Key Research and Development Program of China [2018YFC1508200, 20175018612]; National Natural Science Foundation of ChinaNational Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC) [51709075, 41701015]","This research is supported by the National Key Research and Development Program of China (2018YFC1508200, 20175018612), and the National Natural Science Foundation of China (51709075, 41701015).",,38,0,0,3,3,MDPI,BASEL,"ST ALBAN-ANLAGE 66, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND",,2073-4441,,WATER-SUI,Water,SEP,2021,13,18,,,,,,,2580,10.3390/w13182580,,,17,Environmental Sciences; Water Resources,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),Environmental Sciences & Ecology; Water Resources,UZ3BU,WOS:000702084500001,,gold,,,2022-02-17

Hydrologic forecast centers rely on precipitation forecasts obtained from numerical weather prediction (NWP) models to enforce hydrological models for streamflow forecasting. The uncertainties in raw quantitative precipitation forecasts (QPFs) are enhanced by physiography and orography effects over a diverse landscape, particularly in the western catchments of Canada. A Bayesian post-processing approach called rainfall post-processing (RPP), developed in Australia (Robertson et al., 2013; Shrestha et al., 2015), has been applied to assess its forecast performance in a Canadian catchment. Raw QPFs obtained from two sources, Global Ensemble Forecasting System (GEFS) Reforecast 2 project, from the National Centers for Environmental Prediction, and Global Deterministic Forecast System (GDPS), from Environment and Climate Change Canada, are used in this study.

Unlike existing reservoir modeling software, GRAPS can handle probabilistic streamflow forecasts represented as ensembles for performing multi-reservoir prognostic water allocation and evaluate the reliability of forecast-based allocation with observed streamflow. GRAPS is applied to four linked reservoirs in the Jaguaribe Metropolitan Hydro-System (JMH) in Ceara, North East Brazil. Results from the historical simulation and the zero-inflow policy over the JMH system demonstrate the model's capability to support monthly water allocation and reproduce the observed monthly releases and storages. Additional analyses using streamflow forecast ensembles illustrate GRAP's abilities in developing storage-reliability curves under inflow-forecast uncertainty. Our analyses show that GRAPS is versatile and can be applied for 1) short-term operating policy studies, 2) long-term basin-wide planning evaluations, and 3) climate-information based application studies.","[Xuan, Yi; Ford, Lucas; Mahinthakumar, Kumar; Sankarasubramanian, A.] North Carolina State Univ, Dept Civil Construct & Environm Engn, 2501 Stinson Dr, Raleigh, NC 27607 USA; [De Souza Filho, Assis] Univ Fed Ceara, Dept Hydraul & Environm Engn, Fortaleza, Ceara, Brazil; [Lall, Upmanu] Columbia Univ, Dept Earth & Environm Engn, New York, NY USA",,"Ford, L (corresponding author), North Carolina State Univ, Dept Civil Construct & Environm Engn, 2501 Stinson Dr, Raleigh, NC 27607 USA.",lcford2@ncsu.edu,"Arumugam, Sankarasubramanian/A-1929-2019; Lall, Upmanu/B-7992-2009","Arumugam, Sankarasubramanian/0000-0002-7668-1311; Lall, Upmanu/0000-0003-0529-8128","National Science FoundationNational Science Foundation (NSF) [1442909, 1805293]","This material is based on work supported by the National Science Foundation under Grant No. 1442909 and Grant No. 1805293.

However, streamflow series exhibits strong non-stationary and non-linear; thus the traditional single model may fail to capture the characteristic of hydrological series and hard to maintain the robustness of the model. To overcome this problem, the application of empirical wavelet transform combined with improved complete ensemble empirical mode decomposition with adaptive noise (ICEEWT) is firstly to eliminate the redundant noise and decompose original series into several components as inputs. Secondly, gated recurrent unit (GRU) is employed to deep learn the relationship between historical streamflow series and those of the future. Finally, balancing underfitting and overfitting the improved grey wolf optimizer (IGWO) is adopted with the hybrid model to identify the approximate parameter combination. The case study is conducted by monthly streamflow data at Shangjingyou station and Fenhe reservoir station in the upper reaches of Fenhe River. In comparison with parallel experiments using extreme learning machine (ELM) and least squares support vector machine (LSSVM), the validation results demonstrate that the GRU model can exhibit satisfactory performance in monthly streamflow forecasting. Moreover, the standard GRU model is further improved by IGWO, which consistently remains the performance of in-sample and out-sample. The proposed model ICEEWT-IGWO-GRU is superior to the single GRU model average reducing MAE and RMSE by 50% and 52% for two stations, which indicates its superiority with a more robust prediction.","[Zhao, Xuehua; Lv, Hanfang; Sang, Yuting; Wei, Yizhao; Zhu, Xueping] Taiyuan Univ Technol, Coll Water Resources & Engn, Taiyuan 030024, Peoples R China; [Lv, Shujin] Baoding Univ, Dept Data Sci & Software Engn, Baoding 071000, Peoples R China",,"Zhao, XH (corresponding author), Taiyuan Univ Technol, Coll Water Resources & Engn, Taiyuan 030024, Peoples R China.",zhaoxh688@126.com; lshjin@sina.com,,,National Key Research and Development Program of China [2019YFC0408601]; Key Research and Development Program of Shanxi Province [201903D321052]; Natural Science Foundation of Shanxi ProvinceNatural Science Foundation of Shanxi Province [201901D111060],"This paper is supported by the National Key Research and Development Program of China (2019YFC0408601), Key Research and Development Program of Shanxi Province (201903D321052) and Natural Science Foundation of Shanxi Province (201901D111060).

We statistically downscaled the CFSv2 output to derive the local climate prediction and then incorporated the result to hydrological model to obtain the discharge prediction. The statistical downscaling method used in this research is Multi Windows Constructed Analogue (CA) method using velocity potential (chi) and stream function (psi) at 850 hPa as predictors and daily rainfall as predictand. The windows used are Australian Monsoon Index (AUSMI) and Western North Pacific Monsoon Index (WNPMI). The daily rainfall prediction was then used as an input for the Soil and Water Assessment Toll (SWAT) hydrological model to generate discharge prediction in the Upper Citarum basin. In this study, we investigated how well the prediction system predict low discharge event of <54.8 m(3)/s which influences the turbine movement in Saguling Power House. Our verifications were done in the period of December-January-February 2011 -2016, using Brier Score and Brier Skill Score. The result showed that CFSv2 is able to represent the event of low discharge event that occurs for 10 to 14 days in one month with good accuracy and skill. In addition, the prediction system has a fairly good accuracy in predicting high discharge categories in the same period, so it can also be used as information to mitigate the occurrence of high discharge that will cause flooding.","[Lestari, Luh Putu Pradiptianti] Bandung Inst Technol, Dept Meteorol, Bandung, Indonesia; [Arya, Doni Khaira] Bandung Inst Technol, Dept Civil Engn, Bandung, Indonesia; [Suwarman, Rusmawan; Syahputra, Muhammad Ridho] Bandung Inst Technol, Atmospher Sci Res Grp, Bandung, Indonesia",,"Suwarman, R (corresponding author), Bandung Inst Technol, Atmospher Sci Res Grp, Bandung, Indonesia.",rusmawan@meteo.itb.ac.id,"Suwarman, Rusmawan/Q-8948-2019","Suwarman, Rusmawan/0000-0003-2401-9569","Research, Community Service and Innovation Program (P3MI LPPM)","This research is partly funded by Research, Community Service and Innovation Program (P3MI LPPM).

Historically, operational streamflow forecasts made by the Natural Resources Conservation Service have relied on precipitation and snow water equivalent observations from Snow Telemetry (SNOTEL) sites. We investigate whether also including SNOTEL soil moisture observations improve April-July streamflow volume forecast accuracy at 0, 1, 2, and 3-month lead times at 12 watersheds in Utah and California. We found statistically significant improvement in 0 and 3-month lead time accuracy in 8 of 12 watersheds and 10 of 12 watersheds for 1 and 2-month lead times. Surprisingly, these improvements were insensitive to soil moisture metrics derived from soil physical properties. Forecasts were made with volumetric water content (VWC) averaged from October 1 to the forecast date. By including VWC at the 0-month lead time the forecasts explained 7.3% more variability and increased the streamflow volume accuracy by 8.4% on average compared to standard forecasts that already explained an average 77% of the variability. At 1 to 3-month lead times, the inclusion of soil moisture explained 12.3-26.3% more variability than the standard forecast on average. Our findings indicate including soil moisture observations increased statistical streamflow forecast accuracy and thus, could potentially improve water supply reliability in regions affected by changing snowpacks.","[Harpold, Adrian A.] Univ Nevada, Dept Nat Resources & Environm Sci, 1664 N Virginia St, Reno, NV 89557 USA; [Sutcliffe, Kent; Clayton, Jordan] Nat Resources Conservat Serv NRCS, Utah Snow Survey, Salt Lake City, UT 84116 USA; [Goodbody, Angus] Natl Water & Climate Ctr, NRCS, Portland, OR 97232 USA; [Vazquez, Shareily] Univ Metropolitana, San Juan, PR 00901 USA",,"Harpold, AA (corresponding author), Univ Nevada, Dept Nat Resources & Environm Sci, 1664 N Virginia St, Reno, NV 89557 USA.",aharpold@cabnr.unr.edu,"Harpold, Adrian/K-9262-2015","Harpold, Adrian/0000-0002-2566-9574",USDA NIFAUnited States Department of Agriculture (USDA) [NEV05293]; NASA EPSCoRNational Aeronautics & Space Administration (NASA) [NNX14AN24A]; NSF REU summer fellowship (SBE) [1263352],"We greatly appreciate the input and facilitation of this research by Troy Brosten and Randall Julander at the NRCS Snow Survey in Salt Lake City, Utah.

In this study, we developed a hybrid model (namely GMM-XGBoost), coupling extreme gradient boosting (XGBoost) with Gaussian mixture model (GMM), for monthly streamflow forecasting. The proposed model is based on the principle of modular model, where a complex problem is divided into several simple ones. GMM was applied to cluster streamflow into several groups, using the features selected by a tree-based method. Then, each group was used to fit several single XGBoosts. And the prediction is a weighted average of the single models. Monthly streamflow data at Cuntan and Hankou stations on Yangtze River Basin were used to evaluate the performance of the proposed model. To compare the forecasting efficiency, support vector machine (SVM) and standalone XGBoost were selected as the benchmark models. The results indicated that although all three models yielded quite good performance on one-month ahead forecasting with high Nash-Sutclitte efficiency coefficient (NSE) and low root mean squared error (RMSE), GMM-XGBoost provided the best accuracy with significant improvement of forecasting accuracy. It can be inferred from the results that (1) XGBoost is applicable for streamflow forecasting, and in general, performs better than SVM; (2) the cluster analysis-based modular model is helpful in improving accuracy and capturing the complicated patterns of hydrological process; (3) the proposed GMM-XGBoost model is a superior alternative, which can provide accurate and reliable predictions for optimal water resources management.","[Ni, Lingling; Wang, Dong; Wu, Jianfeng; Wang, Yuankun; Tao, Yuwei] Nanjing Univ, Sch Earth Sci & Engn, Dept Hydrosci, Key Lab Surficial Geochem,Minist Educ, Nanjing 210023, Peoples R China; [Zhang, Jianyun; Liu, Jiufu] Nanjing Hydraul Res Inst, Nanjing, Peoples R China",,"Wang, D; Wu, JF (corresponding author), Nanjing Univ, Sch Earth Sci & Engn, Dept Hydrosci, Key Lab Surficial Geochem,Minist Educ, Nanjing 210023, Peoples R China.",wangdong@nju.edu.cn; jfwu@nju.edu.cn,,,"National Key Research and Development Program of China [2017YFC1502704, 2016YFC0401501]; National Natural Science Foundation of ChinaNational Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC) [41571017, 51679118, 91647203]; Jiangsu Province333 Project [BRA2018060]; Bureau of Hydrology, Ministry of Water resource, China","This study was jointly supported by the National Key Research and Development Program of China (2017YFC1502704, 2016YFC0401501), and the National Natural Science Foundation of China (No. 41571017, 51679118, 91647203) and Jiangsu Province333 Project (BRA2018060).; The data of meteorological variables including rainfall, temperature can be download from National Meteorological Information Center, China (http://data.cma.cn/).Streamflow data from Cuntan and Hankou stations to support this study are from the Bureau of Hydrology, Ministry of Water resource, China.

Characterizing the dependent information and conducting spatio-temporal dependent forecast error correction can reduce the total uncertainty in real-time forecasting. On the basis of a single-site martingale model of forecast evolution (MMFE), which can simulate forecast uncertainty evolution over the temporal scale, this study developed a dynamic long-term streamflow probabilistic forecasting model that addresses spatio-temporal dependent error correction for a multisite system. Error characteristics and hybrid spatiotemporal forecast improvements with complex dependencies are captured by Copula function, which describes the systemwide evolution of forecast uncertainty. The proposed model was verified by forecasting the streamflow of the Hongze Lake-Luoma Lake system in China. The results revealed the following. 1) The spatio-temporal dependent error correction based on MMFE can refine the spatio-temporal dimension hybrid error information, which is helpful in improving forecast accuracy. 2) As the spatio-temporal dependence of forecast uncertainty is described using a Copula function, selection of the marginal distribution and connection function is flexible through combining statistical and informational characteristics of the errors, which is helpful in improving the fittedness of complex system error simulation. 3) Compared with the benchmark forecast model without correction, the proposed model greatly decreased forecast uncertainty by reducing the standard deviation of the errors, continuous ranked probability score (CRPS), and Brier score (BS) by nearly 40%, 11.4%, and 34.6%, respectively, and further reduce the CRPS by 2.1% on average (highest value: 3.7%) and reduce the BS by 1.2% on average (highest value: 2.0%) in comparison with only temporal correction.

The modeling process included four main stages: (1) source data analysis, (2) raw data preprocessing, (3) modeling and tuning, and (4) model evaluation. The results of the RF model indicated that the correlation coefficient between the predicted and actual sequences is over 0.7, and more than 55% of the predicted values could control the errors within 20% compared to the actual measured values, suggesting that machine learning techniques are suitable for predicting the turbidity of raw source water. It was found that the RF model can provide a modest performance boost because of its stronger capacity to capture nonlinear interactions in the data. The findings of this study can inform the development of turbidity prediction models using readily available meteorological forecast data. The model can be applied to other DWTPs using similar shallow lakes as water sources.","[Zhang, Yiping; Yao, Xinyu; Liu, Xiaowei] Zhejiang Univ, Zhejiang Key Lab Drinking Water Safety & Distribu, Hangzhou 310058, Peoples R China; [Wu, Qiang; Huang, Yongbin] Huzhou Water Grp Co Ltd, Huzhou 313000, Peoples R China; [Zhou, Zhixu] Huzhou Meteorol Bur, Huzhou 313005, Peoples R China; [Yang, Jun] Hangzhou Meteorol Informat Ctr, Hangzhou 310051, Peoples R China",,"Zhang, YP; Liu, XW (corresponding author), 866 Yuhangtang Rd, Hangzhou, Zhejiang, Peoples R China.",zhangyiping@zju.edu.cn; liuxiaowei@zju.edu.cn,"Zhang, Yiping/E-7449-2014","Zhang, Yiping/0000-0001-8537-8181",National Science and Technology Major Projects for Water Pollution Control and Treatment [2017ZX07201003]; Zhejiang Public Welfare Technology Research Program [GG21E080021],This work was financially supported by the National Science and Technology Major Projects for Water Pollution Control and Treatment (No. 2017ZX07201003) and the Zhejiang Public Welfare Technology Research Program (No. GG21E080021).,,28,1,1,12,32,ACADEMIC PRESS LTD- ELSEVIER SCIENCE LTD,LONDON,"24-28 OVAL RD, LONDON NW1 7DX, ENGLAND",0301-4797,1095-8630,,J ENVIRON MANAGE,J.

This work catalogs the various pathways of ensemble streamflow forecasting based on an exhaustive review of more than 700 studies over the last 40 years. We focus on the advanced state of the art in the model-based (dynamical) ensemble forecasting approaches. Ensemble streamflow prediction systems are categorized into three leading classes: statistics-based streamflow prediction systems, climatology-based ensemble streamflow prediction systems and numerical weather prediction-based hydrological ensemble prediction systems. For each ensemble approach, technical information, as well as details about its strengths and weaknesses, are provided based on a critical review of the studies listed. Through this literature review, the performance and uncertainty associated with the ensemble forecasting systems are underlined from both operational and scientific viewpoints. Finally, the remaining key challenges and prospective future research directions are presented, notably through hybrid dynamical - statistical learning approaches, which obviously present new challenges to be overcome in order to allow the successful employment of ensemble streamflow forecasting systems in the next decades.

This system made use of a bias correction and spatial downscaling method, and a distributed time-variant gain model (DTVGM) hydrologic model. DTVGM was calibrated using observed daily hydrological data and its streamflow simulations achieved Nash-Sutcliffe efficiency values of 0.727 and 0.724 during calibration (1978-1995) and validation (1996-2005) periods, respectively, at the Danjiangkou reservoir station. The experimental seasonal drought forecasting system (known as NMME-DTVGM) is used to generate seasonal drought forecasts. The forecasts were evaluated against the reference forecasts (i.e., persistence forecast and climatological forecast). The NMME-DTVGM drought forecasts have higher detectability and accuracy and lower false alarm rate than the reference forecasts at different lead times (from 1 to 4 months) during the cold-dry season. No apparent advantage is shown in drought predictions during spring and summer seasons because of a long memory of the initial conditions in spring and a lower predictive skill for precipitation in summer. Overall, the NMME-based seasonal drought forecasting system has meaningful skill in predicting drought several months in advance, which can provide critical information for drought preparedness and response planning as well as the sustainable practice of water resource conservation over the basin.","[Ma, Feng; Ye, Aizhong; Duan, Qingyun] Beijing Normal Univ, Fac Geog Sci, State Key Lab Earth Surface Proc & Resource Ecol, Beijing 100875, Peoples R China; [Ma, Feng; Ye, Aizhong; Duan, Qingyun] Beijing Normal Univ, Fac Geog Sci, Inst Land Surface Syst & Sustainable Dev, Beijing 100875, Peoples R China",,"Ye, AZ (corresponding author), Beijing Normal Univ, Fac Geog Sci, State Key Lab Earth Surface Proc & Resource Ecol, Beijing 100875, Peoples R China.; Ye, AZ (corresponding author), Beijing Normal Univ, Fac Geog Sci, Inst Land Surface Syst & Sustainable Dev, Beijing 100875, Peoples R China.",azye@bnu.edu.cn,"Duan, Qingyun/C-7652-2011","Duan, Qingyun/0000-0001-9955-1512",Natural Science Foundation of ChinaNational Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC) [41475093]; Intergovernmental Key International S&T Innovation Cooperation Program [2016YFE0102400]; State Key Laboratory of Severe Weather Open Research Program [2015LASW-A05],"This study was supported by the Natural Science Foundation of China (No. 41475093), the Intergovernmental Key International S&T Innovation Cooperation Program (No. 2016YFE0102400) and the State Key Laboratory of Severe Weather Open Research Program (No. 2015LASW-A05).",,53,10,10,6,55,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"ONE NEW YORK PLAZA, SUITE 4600, NEW YORK, NY, UNITED STATES",0930-7575,1432-0894,,CLIM DYNAM,Clim.

On the other hand, skillful operational hydrologic forecasts are vital in water resources engineering and management for preparedness against flooding and extreme events. Multi-model techniques can be used to help represent and quantify various uncertainties in forecasting. In this paper, we assess the performance of a Multi-model Seasonal Ensemble Streamflow Prediction (MSESP) scheme coupled with statistical post-processing techniques to issue operational uncertainty for the Manitoba Hydrologic Forecasting Centre (HFC). The Ensemble Streamflow Predictions (ESPs) from WATFLOOD and SWAT hydrologic models were used along with four statistical post-processing techniques: Linear Regression (LR), Quantile Mapping (QM), Quantile Model Averaging (QMA), and Bayesian Model Averaging (BMA)]. The quality of MSESP was investigated from April to July with a lead time of three months for the Upper Assiniboine River Basin (UARB) at Kamsack, Canada. While multi-model ESPs coupled with post-processing techniques improve predictability (in general), results suggest that additional avenues for improving the skill and value of seasonal streamflow prediction. Next steps towards an operational ESP system include adding more operationally used models, improving models calibration methods to reduce model bias, increasing ESP sample size, and testing ESP schemes at multiple lead times, which, once developed, will not only help HFCs in Canada but would also help Centers South of the Border.","[Muhammad, Ameer; Stadnyk, Tricia A.] Univ Manitoba, Dept Civil Engn, Winnipeg, MB R3T 5V6, Canada; [Unduche, Fisaha] Manitoba Infrastruct, Hydrol Forecasting & Coordinat, Winnipeg, MB R3C 0R8, Canada; [Coulibaly, Paulin] McMaster Univ, Dept Civil Engn, Hamilton, ON L8S 4L7, Canada",,"Muhammad, A (corresponding author), Univ Manitoba, Dept Civil Engn, Winnipeg, MB R3T 5V6, Canada.",muhamma3@myumanitoba.ca; Tricia.Stadnyk@umanitoba.ca; Fisaha.Unduche@gov.mb.ca; couliba@mcmaster.ca,"Stadnyk, Tricia/ABC-8061-2021","Stadnyk, Tricia/0000-0002-2145-4963; Muhammad, Ameer/0000-0002-3689-5577",Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada under Canadian FloodNet project [NETGP 451456],This research was funded by the Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada under Canadian FloodNet project (Grant number: NETGP 451456).,,79,14,14,0,8,MDPI,BASEL,"ST ALBAN-ANLAGE 66, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND",,2073-4441,,WATER-SUI,Water,NOV,2018,10,11,,,,,,,1604,10.3390/w10111604,,,18,Environmental Sciences; Water Resources,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),Environmental Sciences & Ecology; Water Resources,HC3XM,WOS:000451736300111,,"Green Submitted, Green Published, gold",,,2022-02-17

Ensemble Streamflow Prediction (ESP) is commonly used in the case of long-term lead times (a few months or seasons ahead). ESP covers the use of historical meteorological scenarios in driving a hydrological model to generate an ensemble of possible future streamflow. Many studies have evaluated methods for selecting optimal subsets of scenarios to improve forecasting skill, and indeed, this is still an ongoing area of research. In this study, we propose a procedure that calculates the maximum potential skill of a classic ESP forecast. A genetic algorithm (GA) is used to determine the best possible set of climatological scenarios given any ensemble size. Along with providing a direct estimate of the ESP forecasting potential in hindcast experiments, the method can be used as a reference for comparing other methods to ESP. The procedure is also used to compare classical ESP, a well-established forecasting method, with two new methods, namely, the Analogue method and the Contingency Table (CT) approach. A discriminant analysis is finally implemented to attempt to identify key features of ESP members that performed well as compared to their counterparts using historic climatology and climate indices. It is shown while there exists a potential for improvement, a lot of research must still be realized to exploit this potential. The procedure was tested over two basins in Canada. In general, results showed that for any forecast date, decreasing the ensemble size led to a higher potential for better forecasting skills. However, the method does not yet allow identifying the subset of the entire climatology to be used to maximize the ESP forecast performance.","[Sabzipour, Behmard; Arsenault, Richard; Brissette, Francois] Ecole Technol Super, Hydrol Climate & Climate Change Lab, 1100 Notre Dame St West, Montreal, PQ H3C 1K3, Canada",,"Sabzipour, B (corresponding author), Ecole Technol Super, Hydrol Climate & Climate Change Lab, 1100 Notre Dame St West, Montreal, PQ H3C 1K3, Canada.",behmard.sabzipour.1@ens.etsmtl.ca,,,"Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada (NSERC)Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada (NSERC) [RGPIN 2018-04872, CRDPJ 522126-17]",This research was funded in part by the Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada (NSERC; grant numbers RGPIN 2018-04872 and CRDPJ 522126-17).

This study uses the NCAR Weather Research and Forecast model (WRF) to dynamically downscale climate simulations over the Saginaw Bay Watershed, MI and prepare the results for input into semi-distributed hydrologic models. One realization of the bias-corrected NCAR CESM1 model's RCP 8.5 climate scenario is dynamically downscaled at a spatial resolution of 3 km by 3 km for the end of the twenty-first century and validated based on a downscaled run for the end of the twentieth century in comparison to ASOS and NWS COOP stations. Bias-correction is conducted using Quantile Mapping to correct daily maximum and minimum temperature, precipitation, and relative humidity for use in future hydrologic model experiments. In the Saginaw Bay Watershed the end of the twenty-first century is projected to see maximum and minimum average daily temperatures warming by 5.7 and 6.3 degrees C respectively. Precipitation characteristics over the watershed show an increase in mean annual precipitation (average of +14.3 mm over the watershed), mainly due to increases in precipitation intensity (average of +0.3 mm per precipitation day) despite a decrease in frequency of -10.7 days per year. The projected changes have substantial implications for watershed processes including flood prediction, erosion, mobilization of non-point source and legacy contaminants, and evapotranspirative demand, among others.

Accurate forecasting of algal parameters (i.e., algal cell density and microcystin concentration) has great practical significance for taking precautions against HABs risks. Long short-term memory (LSTM) networks have recently shown potential in predicting water quality parameters. However, there is still little known about the robustness of the LSTM in forecasting highly time-resolved measurement of algal parameters. This study developed a hybrid deep-learning architecture (XG-LSTM) composed of one XGBoost module and two parallel LSTM models to predict algal cell density and microcystin concentration in the Three Gorges Reservoir (TGR). The proposed model was validated by in situ multi-sensor-system monitoring data at four bloom-impacted tributaries in the TGR. Each modelling process utilized the antecedent information of the algal parameters and the corresponding environmental variables as inputs for forecasting the algal parameters for the coming hours and days. As expected, the presented model achieved better performance than those without special feature extraction procedures, providing that the use of selected environmental parameters can improve LSTM performance. In addition, the hybrid XG-LSTM model successfully captured the time-series patterns of both algal cell density and microcystin concentration compared with other data-driven models, further suggesting the reliable utilization of this model in early warnings of bloom toxicity. Thus, the results presented demonstrate the potential of deep learning technology for real-time prediction of algal parameters in the TGR, and possibly for rapid detection of developing HABs in other aquatic ecosystems.","[Shan, Kun; Wang, Xiaoxiao; Zhou, Botian; Shang, Mingsheng] Chinese Acad Sci, Chongqing Inst Green & Intelligent Technol, CAS Key Lab Reservoir Environm, Chongqing 400714, Peoples R China; [Shan, Kun; Wang, Xiaoxiao; Zhou, Botian; Shang, Mingsheng] Univ Chinese Acad Sci, Chongqing Sch, Chongqing 400714, Peoples R China; [Ouyang, Tian; Wu, Zhongxing] Southwest Univ, Sch Life Sci, Key Lab Ecoenvironm Three Gorges Reservoir Reg, Minist Educ, Chongqing 400715, Peoples R China; [Yang, Hong] Univ Reading, Dept Geog & Environm Sci, Whiteknights Reading RG6 6AB, England",,"Shan, K (corresponding author), Chinese Acad Sci, Chongqing Inst Green & Intelligent Technol, CAS Key Lab Reservoir Environm, Chongqing 400714, Peoples R China.; Shan, K (corresponding author), Univ Chinese Acad Sci, Chongqing Sch, Chongqing 400714, Peoples R China.",shankun@cigit.ac.cn,,,"National Natural Science Foundation of ChinaNational Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC) [62072429, 51609229, 41901366]; Chongqing Science and Technology CommissionNatural Science Foundation Project of CQ CSTC [cstc2019jscx-gksbX0042]; West Light Foundation of The Chinese Academy of SciencesChinese Academy of Sciences [E1296001]; China National Critical Project [2014ZX07104-006]; key cooperation project of Chongqing Municipal Education Commission [HZ2021008]","This work was supported by the National Natural Science Foundation of China (No. 62072429; 51609229; 41901366), Chongqing Science and Technology Commission (cstc2019jscx-gksbX0042).

These changes are particularly problematic for decisions that face economic and organizational constraints from those changes. The use of climate forecasts informed by scientific observations and statistical analyses that assume system dynamism may improve decision making and outcomes, however many of these stakeholders rely on traditional and/or folkloric strategies based on observations from the environment. Here we survey 87 stakeholders representing groups such as national agencies, farmers, and water managers in the semi-arid region of Guanacaste, Costa Rica on (1) their perceptions of freshwater security, (2) the role of forecast type (weekly, seasonal, and yearly) plays in their decision making, and (3) the factors that most influence the use of forecasts in decision making. Stakeholders report having enough freshwater to meet their current needs, however they are less certain about the future. Stakeholders are generally using forecasts but that use is not uniform - the most vulnerable to shocks are those that tend to trust traditional and/or folkloric methods the most, and are the least likely to use longer-term forecasts in their decision making. Policies for enhancing engagement between the potential users and producers of forecasts may increase use of climate forecasts among the most vulnerable stakeholders.","[Wong-Parodi, Gabrielle] Carnegie Mellon Univ, Dept Engn & Publ Policy, 5000 Forbes Ave, Pittsburgh, PA 15213 USA; [Babcock, Matthew] Carnegie Mellon Univ, Inst Software Res, 5000 Forbes Ave, Pittsburgh, PA 15213 USA",,"Wong-Parodi, G (corresponding author), Carnegie Mellon Univ, Dept Engn & Publ Policy, 5000 Forbes Ave, Pittsburgh, PA 15213 USA.",gwongpar@stanford.edu; mbabcock@andrew.cmu.edu,,,"U.S. National Science FoundationNational Science Foundation (NSF) [ICER1342941-NSF]; FuturAgua, a multinational, multidisciplinary Belmont Forum G-8 Initiative Collaborative Research project","This work was funded by FuturAgua, a multinational, multidisciplinary Belmont Forum G-8 Initiative Collaborative Research project.

Statistical and semiempirical models have long been used to provide seasonal forecasts of the mid-summer hypoxic extent using historic time series of spring nutrient load and mid-summer hypoxic extent. These forecasts consist of a scalar estimate of the hypoxic area with uncertainty but do not include spatial distributions or temporal evolution of hypoxic conditions. Three-dimensional (3D) circulation-biogeochemical models of the coastal ocean simulate the temporal evolution of hypoxia in a spatially explicit manner but have not yet been used for seasonal hypoxia forecasting. Here, we present a hybrid method for seasonal, spatially explicit, time-evolving forecasts of the hypoxic zone that combines statistical forecasting with information from a 3D biogeochemical model. The hybrid method uses spring nitrate load and a multiyear (1985-2018) 3D hindcast simulation to produce a seasonal forecast. Validation shows that the method explains up to 76% of the observed year-to-year variability in the hypoxic area. The forecasts suggest that the maximum seasonal extent of hypoxia is reached, on average, on August 13, 2 weeks after the completion of the annual cruise. An analysis of month-to-month variations in hypoxia forecasts due to variability in wind speed and freshwater discharge allows estimates of weather-related uncertainties in the forecast.","[Laurent, Arnaud; Fennel, Katja] Dalhousie Univ, Dept Oceanog, Halifax, NS B3H 4R2, Canada",,"Laurent, A (corresponding author), Dalhousie Univ, Dept Oceanog, Halifax, NS B3H 4R2, Canada.",,"Laurent, Arnaud/M-5750-2018","Laurent, Arnaud/0000-0002-8545-9309",National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration's National Centers for Coastal Ocean Science Competitive Research Program [NA160AR4320199],This paper is the result of research funded by the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration's National Centers for Coastal Ocean Science Competitive Research Program under award NA160AR4320199 to Dalhousie University.

For a river basin undergoing fast urban development, its regional meteorological condition interacts frequently with intensive human activities and climate change, which gives rise to the non-stationary process between rainfall and runoff whose non-stationary features is difficult to be captured by a non-recurrent data-driven model with a static learning mechanism. This study proposes a recurrent Adaptive-Network-based Fuzzy Inference System (R-ANFIS) embedded with Genetic Algorithm and Least Square Estimator (GL) that optimize model parameters for making multi-step-ahead forecasts. The main merit of the proposed method (R-ANFIS(GL)) lies in capturing the features of the non-stationary process between rainfall and runoff series as well as in alleviating time-lag effects encountered in multi-step-ahead flood forecasting. To demonstrate model reliability and effectiveness, the R-ANFIS(GL) model was implemented to make multi-step-ahead forecasts from horizons t + 1 up to t + 8 for a famous benchmark chaotic time series and a flood inflow series of the Three Gorges Reservoir (TGR) in China. For comparison purpose, two ANFIS neural networks of different structures (one dynamic and one static neural networks) were also implemented. Numerical and experimental results indicated that the R-ANFIS(GL) model not only outperformed the two comparative networks but significantly enhanced the accuracy of multi-step-ahead forecasts for both chaotic time series and the reservoir inflow case during flood seasons, where effective mitigation of time-lag bottlenecks was achieved. We demonstrated that the R-ANFIS(GL) model could suitably configure the complex non-stationary rainfall-runoff process and effectively integrate the monitored rainfall and discharge data with the latest outputs of the model so that the time shift problem could be alleviated and model reliability as well as forecast accuracy for future horizons could be significantly improved.","[Zhou, Yanlai; Guo, Shenglian] Wuhan Univ, State Key Lab Water Resources & Hydropower Engn S, Wuhan 430072, Hubei, Peoples R China; [Zhou, Yanlai; Chang, Fi-John] Natl Taiwan Univ, Dept Bioenvironm Syst Engn, Taipei 10617, Taiwan; [Zhou, Yanlai] Univ Oslo, Dept Geosci, N-0316 Oslo, Norway",,"Chang, FJ (corresponding author), Natl Taiwan Univ, Dept Bioenvironm Syst Engn, Taipei 10617, Taiwan.",changfj@ntu.edu.tw,,"Zhou, Yanlai/0000-0002-5447-2420; Chang, Fi-John/0000-0002-1655-8573; Guo, shenglian/0000-0002-8594-4988","China Postdoctoral Science FoundationChina Postdoctoral Science Foundation [2017M620336]; Research Council of Norway (FRINATEK Project)Research Council of Norway [274310]; China National Key Research and Development Program [2018YFC0407904]; Ministry of Science and Technology, TaiwanMinistry of Science and Technology, Taiwan [MOST 104-2313-B-002 -023 -MY3]","This study is financially supported by the China Postdoctoral Science Foundation (No. 2017M620336), the Research Council of Norway (FRINATEK Project 274310), the China National Key Research and Development Program (2018YFC0407904) and the Ministry of Science and Technology, Taiwan (MOST 104-2313-B-002 -023 -MY3).

However, it is still a challenging task to improve the performance of these models, especially for the rivers with dramatic flow changes. In this paper, a new integrated framework for daily streamflow forecasting based on different flow regimes is developed. The framework integrates a Fuzzy C-means (FCM) clustering for streamflow regime identification, a partial mutual information (PMI) for input selection, Deep Belief Networks (DBN) for mapping the nonlinear relationships between the selected inputs and streamflow during different streamflow dynamics processes, and a rigorous validation process considering structure validity to interpret the physical processes simulated using the DBN models. The framework was applied to three streamflow stations with different climate conditions in USA, and the results show that the framework has significantly improved modelling performance (approximately 12%) compared to single data-driven models. The integration of data-driven models and physical process classification also leads to improved integration of physical understanding of the complex characteristic of different flow regimes into the modelling process, leading to overall improved confidence in the developed daily streamflow forecasting models.","[Chu, Haibo; Chu, Qi] Beijing Univ Technol, Coll Architecture & Civil Engn, Beijing, Peoples R China; [Wei, Jiahua] Tsinghua Univ, State Key Lab Hydrosci & Engn, Beijing, Peoples R China; [Wu, Wenyan] Univ Melbourne, Dept Infrastruct Engn, Melbourne, Vic, Australia; [Jiang, Yuan] Beijing Inst Geol, Beijing, Peoples R China; [Meng, Xiujing] China Ordnance Ind Survey & Geotech Inst CO LTD, Beijing, Peoples R China",,"Chu, HB (corresponding author), Beijing Univ Technol, Coll Architecture & Civil Engn, Beijing, Peoples R China.",chuhaibo@bjut.edu.cn,"Wei, Jiahua/AAA-8543-2019","Wei, Jiahua/0000-0003-1387-6442",Natural Science Foundation of Qinghai Province [2019-ZJ-941Q]; State Key Laboratory of Hydroscience and Engineering of Tsinghua University [2019-KY-01],"This work has been sponsored in Natural Science Foundation of Qinghai Province (No. 2019-ZJ-941Q) and the foundation from State Key Laboratory of Hydroscience and Engineering of Tsinghua University (2019-KY-01).

It is thus necessary to understand and predict stream water quality in accordance with different urban development patterns to effectively advise urban growth planning and policies. To do so, we collected pollutant concentration data on nitrate (NO3--N), total phosphate (TP), and Escherichia coli (E. coli) from 1047 sampling stations in the Texas Gulf Region. We utilized a Random Forest (RF) machine learning model to predict stream water quality under four planning scenarios with different urban densities and configurations. SHapley Additive exPlanations (SHAP) was used to prove the importance of urban development pattern in influencing stream water quality. The spatial variations of the impact of these patterns were explored with Geographically Weighted Regression (GWR). SHAP results indicated that Largest Patch Index (LPI), Patch Cohesion Index (COHESION), Splitting Index (SPLIT), and Landscape Division Index (DIVISION) were the most important urban development pattern metrics affecting stream water quality. The spatial variations of such patterns were shown to impact stream water quality depending on pollutants, seasonality, climate, and urbanization level. RF prediction results suggested that high density aggregated development was more effective in reducing TP and NO3--N concentrations than the current sprawl development, but had the potential risk of increasing E. coli pollution in the wet season. The results of this study provide empirical evidence and a potential mechanistic explanation that stream water quality degradation is a consequence of urban sprawl. Lastly, machine learning is a powerful tool for scenario prediction in land use planning to forecast environmental impacts under different urban development pattern scenarios. (C) 2020 Elsevier B.V.

As China attaches increasing importance to environmental protection, many regions are trying to reduce water pollution through land use changes. The long-term variations of the nonpoint source (NPS) pollution affected by land use changes in the DLRB have not been previously assessed. In this study, the contributions of land use/land cover (LULC) changes in 1980-2015 to NPS pollution were evaluated by comparing simulations under paired land use scenarios using the Soil and Water Assessment Tool (SWAT). The historical trend and ecological protection scenarios in 2025 were established based on CA-Markov model, and pollution loads in both scenarios were forecasted. Results show that the expansion of dryland and urban areas and the decline in forest and grassland coverage were the major contributors to the increase in NPS pollution in the DLRB. The expansion of paddy field resulted in an increase in actual total phosphorus (TP) but a decrease in total nitrogen (TN). In the historical trend scenario, dryland would decrease by 4.57%. TN and TP loads were 1.40% and 1.45% lower than those in 2015, respectively. In the ecological protection scenario, TN and TP loads were 3.37% and 6.11% lower than those in 2015, respectively, due to the decreased area of dryland by 7.22%. Pollutions in the riverside and southeast areas of the basin would be reduced in 2025.

To consider the applicability of Climate Forecast System Reanalysis (CFSR) data in the hydrologic simulation of watersheds, the Bahe River Basin was used as a case study. Two types of weather data (conventional weather data and CFSR weather data) were considered to establish a Soil and Water Assessment Tool (SWAT) model, which was used to simulate runoff from 2001 to 2012 in the basin at annual and monthly scales. The effect of both datasets on the simulation was assessed using regression analysis, Nash-Sutcliffe Efficiency (NSE), and Percent Bias (PBIAS). A CFSR weather data correction method was proposed. The main results were as follows. (1) The CFSR climate data was applicable for hydrologic simulation in the Bahe River Basin (R-2 of the simulated results above 0.50, NSE above 0.33, and |PBIAS| below 14.8. Although the quality of the CFSR weather data is not perfect, it achieved a satisfactory hydrological simulation after rainfall data correction. (2) The simulated streamflow using the CFSR data was higher than the observed streamflow, which was likely because the estimation of daily rainfall data by CFSR weather data resulted in more rainy days and stronger rainfall intensity than was actually observed. Therefore, the data simulated a higher base flow and flood peak discharge in terms of the water balance, except for some individual years. (3) The relation between the CFSR rainfall data (x) and the observed rainfall data (y) could be represented by a power exponent equation: y=1.4789x(0.8875) (R-2= 0.98, P < 0.001). There was a slight variation between the fitted equations for each station. The equation provides a theoretical basis for the correction of CFSR rainfall data.","[Hu Sheng; Qiu Haijun; Yang Dongdong; Cao Mingming; Song Jinxi; Wu Jiang; Huang Chenlu] Northwestern Univ, Coll Urban & Environm Sci, Xian 710127, Peoples R China; [Hu Sheng; Qiu Haijun; Yang Dongdong; Cao Mingming; Song Jinxi; Wu Jiang; Huang Chenlu] Northwestern Univ, Inst Earth Surface Syst & Hazards, Xian 710127, Peoples R China; [Gao Yu] Shaanxi Prov Land Engn Construct Grp, Xian 710175, Peoples R China",,"Qiu, HJ (corresponding author), Northwestern Univ, Coll Urban & Environm Sci, Xian 710127, Peoples R China.; Qiu, HJ (corresponding author), Northwestern Univ, Inst Earth Surface Syst & Hazards, Xian 710127, Peoples R China.",husheng198800@126.com; rgbitxpl@163.com,"Song, Jinxi/AAF-6060-2020","Song, Jinxi/0000-0001-9838-8063; Hu, Sheng/0000-0002-7983-5304",International Partnership Program of Chinese Academy of Sciences [131551KYSB20160002]; National Natural Science Foundation of ChinaNational Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC) [41401602]; Natural Science Basic Research Plan in Shaanxi Province of China [2014JQ2-4021]; Key Scientific and Technological Innovation Team Plan of Shaanxi Province [2014KCT-27]; Graduate Student Innovation Project of Northwest University [YZZ15011],"International Partnership Program of Chinese Academy of Sciences, No. 131551KYSB20160002; National Natural Science Foundation of China, No. 41401602; Natural Science Basic Research Plan in Shaanxi Province of China, No. 2014JQ2-4021; Key Scientific and Technological Innovation Team Plan of Shaanxi Province, No. 2014KCT-27; Graduate Student Innovation Project of Northwest University, No. YZZ15011",,28,9,10,3,33,SCIENCE PRESS,BEIJING,"16 DONGHUANGCHENGGEN NORTH ST, BEIJING 100717, PEOPLES R CHINA",1009-637X,1861-9568,,J GEOGR SCI,J.

Therefore geospatial techniques could be integrated with mathematical models for accurate spatiotemporal mapping of groundwater risk areas at the village level. In the present study, changes in water level, quality patterns, and future trends were analyzed using eight years (2012-2019) groundwater data for 171 villages of the Phagi tehsil, Jaipur district. Kriging interpolation method was used to draw spatial maps for the pre-monsoon season. These datasets were integrated with three different time series forecasting models (Simple Exponential Smoothing, Holt's Trend Method, ARIMA) and Artificial Neural Network models for accurate prediction of groundwater level and quality parameters. Results reveal that the ANN model can describe groundwater level and quality parameters more accurately than the time series forecasting models. The change in groundwater level was observed with more than 4.0 m rise in 81 villages during 2012-2013, whereas ANN predicted results of 2023-2024 predict no rise in water level > 4.0 m. However, based on predicted results of 2024, the water level will drop by more than 6.0 m in 16 villages of Phagi. Assessment of water quality index reveals unfit groundwater in 74% villages for human consumption in 2024. This time series and projected groundwater level and quality at the micro-level can assist decision-makers in sustainable groundwater management.","[Dadhich, Ankita P.; Goyal, Rohit] Malaviya Natl Inst Technol, Dept Civil Engn, JLN Marg, Jaipur 302017, Rajasthan, India; [Dadhich, Pran N.] Poornima Inst Engn & Technol, Dept Civil Engn, ISI 2, Jaipur 302022, Rajasthan, India",,"Dadhich, AP (corresponding author), Malaviya Natl Inst Technol, Dept Civil Engn, JLN Marg, Jaipur 302017, Rajasthan, India.",ankitadadhich@mnit.ac.in; rgoyal.ce@mnit.ac.in; pran.dadhich@poornima.org,,,"Department of Science & Technology, Government of IndiaDepartment of Science & Technology (India) [DST/WOS-B/2018/1575/ETD/Ankita]","Department of Science & Technology, Government of India for financial support vide reference number DST/WOS-B/2018/1575/ETD/Ankita under Women Scientist Scheme (WOS-B) to carry out this research work.",,39,1,1,12,16,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0920-4741,1573-1650,,WATER RESOUR MANAG,Water Resour.

The groundwater table level in these low relief coastal cities is an important, but often overlooked, factor in the recurrent flooding these locations face. Infiltration of stormwater and water intrusion due to tidal forcing can cause already shallow groundwater tables to quickly rise toward the land surface. This decreases available storage which increases runoff, stormwater system loads, and flooding. Groundwater table forecasts, which could help inform the modeling and management of coastal flooding, are generally unavailable. This study explores two machine learning models, Long Short-term Memory (LSTM) networks and Recurrent Neural Networks (RNN), to model and forecast groundwater table response to storm events in the flood prone coastal city of Norfolk, Virginia. To determine the effect of training data type on model accuracy, two types of datasets (i) the continuous time series and (ii) a dataset of only storm events, created from observed groundwater table, rainfall, and sea level data from 2010-2018 are used to train and test the models. Additionally, a real-time groundwater table forecasting scenario was carried out to compare the models' abilities to predict groundwater table levels given forecast rainfall and sea level as input data. When modeling the groundwater table with observed data, LSTM networks were found to have more predictive skill than RNNs (root mean squared error (RMSE) of 0.09 m versus 0.14 m, respectively). The real-time forecast scenario showed that models trained only on storm event data outperformed models trained on the continuous time series data (RMSE of 0.07 m versus 0.66 m, respectively) and that LSTM outperformed RNN models. Because models trained with the continuous time series data had much higher RMSE values, they were not suitable for predicting the groundwater table in the real-time scenario when using forecast input data. These results demonstrate the first use of LSTM networks to create hourly forecasts of groundwater table in a coastal city and show they are well suited for creating operational forecasts in real-time. As groundwater table levels increase due to sea level rise, forecasts of groundwater table will become an increasingly valuable part of coastal flood modeling and management.","[Bowes, Benjamin D.; Sadler, Jeffrey M.; Morsy, Mohamed M.; Behl, Madhur; Goodall, Jonathan L.] Univ Virginia, Dept Engn Syst & Environm, 351 McCormick Rd,POB 400742, Charlottesville, VA 22904 USA; [Morsy, Mohamed M.] Cairo Univ, Irrigat & Hydraul Dept, POB 12211, Giza 12614, Egypt; [Behl, Madhur] Univ Virginia, Dept Comp Sci, 351 McCormick Rd,POB 400259, Charlottesville, VA 22904 USA",,"Goodall, JL (corresponding author), Univ Virginia, Dept Engn Syst & Environm, 351 McCormick Rd,POB 400742, Charlottesville, VA 22904 USA.",bdb3m@virginia.edu; jms3fb@virginia.edu; mmm4dh@virginia.edu; mb2kg@virginia.edu; goodall@virginia.edu,"Goodall, Jonathan/B-3663-2009","Goodall, Jonathan/0000-0002-1112-4522; Bowes, Benjamin/0000-0001-8349-4787; Morsy, Mohamed/0000-0001-9217-4822",National Science FoundationNational Science Foundation (NSF) [1735587],"This work was funded as part of a National Science Foundation grant: Award #1735587 (CRISP-Critical, Resilient Interdependent Infrastructure Systems and Processes).",,75,43,43,20,57,MDPI,BASEL,"ST ALBAN-ANLAGE 66, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND",,2073-4441,,WATER-SUI,Water,MAY,2019,11,5,,,,,,,1098,10.3390/w11051098,,,38,Environmental Sciences; Water Resources,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),Environmental Sciences & Ecology; Water Resources,IE9FN,WOS:000472680400228,,gold,,,2022-02-17

Although CFSv2 predictions show a warm bias for the climatological mean SAT over the Yangtze River valley (25 degrees-32 degrees N, 105 degrees-122 degrees E), they show a consistent and great performance in predicting the interannual variability of the mid-summer SAT over this region until 4 months in advance, where the linear correlation coefficient between the predicted and observed time series reaches +0.65, +0.51 and + 0.68 for 4, 2 and 0 months in advance, respectively. The CFSv2 predictions well simulate the linkage between the SAT anomalies over the Yangtze River valley and the anomalous atmospheric circulation aloft, including the circumglobal teleconnection and zonal extension of the Western Pacific Subtropical High. However, CFSv2 has trouble in simulating the associated vertical velocity, cloud cover and solar radiation anomalies, except for 0 months in advance. The persistent forecasting skills result from the accurate response of the circumglobal teleconnection and Western Pacific Subtropical High to the El Nino/Southern Oscillation and sea surface temperature (SST) anomalies over the mid-latitude North Atlantic. Correspondingly, the forecasting skill, signal and signal-to-noise ratio are effectively improved in the years with strong mid-summer SST anomalies over the tropical central-eastern Pacific or mid-latitude North Atlantic. These results are useful for understanding the predictability of the mid-summer SAT over the Yangtze River valley.","[Tang, Shankai; Qiao, Shaobo; Feng, Taichen; Jia, Zikang; Zang, Naihui; Feng, Guolin] Lanzhou Univ, Coll Atmospher Sci, Lanzhou, Peoples R China; [Feng, Guolin] Yangzhou Univ, Coll Phys Sci & Technol, Yangzhou, Jiangsu, Peoples R China; [Qiao, Shaobo] Sun Yat Sen Univ, Sch Atmospher Sci, Zhuhai, Peoples R China; [Qiao, Shaobo] Sun Yat Sen Univ, Guangdong Prov Key Lab Climate Change & Nat Disas, Zhuhai, Peoples R China; [Qiao, Shaobo; Feng, Guolin] Southern Marine Sci & Engn Guangdong Lab, Zhuhai, Peoples R China; [Feng, Guolin] China Meteorol Adm, Natl Climate Ctr, Beijing, Peoples R China",,"Qiao, SB (corresponding author), Sun Yat Sen Univ, Sch Atmospher Sci, Zhuhai, Peoples R China.; Qiao, SB (corresponding author), Sun Yat Sen Univ, Guangdong Prov Key Lab Climate Change & Nat Disas, Zhuhai, Peoples R China.; Feng, GL (corresponding author), China Meteorol Adm, Natl Climate Ctr, Beijing, Peoples R China.",qiaoshb3@mail.sysu.edu.cn; fenggl@cma.gov.cn,,"Tang, Shankai/0000-0003-2857-9387","China Postdoctoral Science FoundationChina Postdoctoral Science Foundation [2018M640848]; General Program of the National Natural Science Foundation of ChinaNational Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC) [41905057, 41875096, 41705050, 41975088]; National Natural Science Foundation of ChinaNational Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC); National Key Research and Development Program of China [2018YFC1507702, 2017YFC1502300]","China Postdoctoral Science Foundation funded project, Grant/Award Number: 2018M640848; General Program of the National Natural Science Foundation of China, Grant/Award Numbers: 41905057, 41875096, 41705050, 41975088; China Postdoctoral Science Foundation; National Natural Science Foundation of China; National Key Research and Development Program of China, Grant/Award Numbers: 2018YFC1507702, 2017YFC1502300",,67,2,2,6,17,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0899-8418,1097-0088,,INT J CLIMATOL,Int.

In cold and snowy countries, particularly in snow-dominated watersheds, enhanced flood prediction requires adequate snowmelt estimation techniques. Whereas the majority of the studies on snow modeling have focused on comparing the performance of empirical techniques and physically based methods, very few studies have investigated empirical models and conceptual models for improving spring peak flow prediction. The objective of this study is to investigate the potential of empirical degree-day method (DDM) to effectively and accurately predict peak flows compared to sophisticated and conceptual SNOW-17 model at two watersheds in Canada: the La-Grande River Basin (LGRB) and the Upper Assiniboine river at Shellmouth Reservoir (UASR). Additional insightful contributions include the evaluation of a seasonal model calibration approach, an annual model calibration method, and two hydrological models: McMaster University Hydrologiska Byrans Vattenbalansavdelning (MAC-HBV) and Sacramento Soil Moisture Accounting model (SAC-SMA). A total of eight model scenarios were considered for each watershed. Results indicate that DDM was very competitive with SNOW-17 at both the study sites, whereas it showed significant improvement in prediction accuracy at UASR. Moreover, the seasonally calibrated model appears to be an effective alternative to an annual model calibration approach, while the SAC-SMA model outperformed the MAC-HBV model, no matter which snowmelt computation method, calibration approach, or study basin is used. Conclusively, the DDM and seasonal model calibration approach coupled with the SAC-SMA hydrologic model appears to be a robust model combination for spring peak flow estimation.","[Agnihotri, Jetal; Coulibaly, Paulin] McMaster Univ, Sch Geog & Earth Sci, 1280 Main St West, Hamilton, ON L8S 4K1, Canada; [Coulibaly, Paulin] McMaster Univ, Dept Civil Engn, 1280 Main St West, Hamilton, ON L8S 4L7, Canada; [Coulibaly, Paulin] United Nations Univ Inst Water Environm & Hlth, Hamilton, ON L8P 0A1, Canada",,"Agnihotri, J (corresponding author), McMaster Univ, Sch Geog & Earth Sci, 1280 Main St West, Hamilton, ON L8S 4K1, Canada.",jetal6102@gmail.com; couliba@mcmaster.ca,,,Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada (NSERC)Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada (NSERC) [NETGP 451456],This work was supported by the Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada (NSERC) under Canadian FloodNet Project (Grant number: NETGP 451456).,,60,3,3,0,3,MDPI,BASEL,"ST ALBAN-ANLAGE 66, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND",,2073-4441,,WATER-SUI,Water,MAY,2020,12,5,,,,,,,1290,10.3390/w12051290,,,21,Environmental Sciences; Water Resources,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),Environmental Sciences & Ecology; Water Resources,MU8KA,WOS:000555915200069,,"Green Submitted, gold",,,2022-02-17

We acquired time series of lake ice breakup and freeze up, local weather conditions, and large-scale climate oscillations from 1981-2015 for seven lakes in northern Wisconsin, USA, and two lakes in Ontario, Canada. Multiple linear regression models were developed to understand the drivers of lake ice phenology. We used projected air temperature and precipitation from 126 climate change scenarios to forecast the day of year of ice breakup and freeze up in 2050 and 2070. Lake ice melted 5 days earlier and froze 8 days later over the past 35 years. Warmer spring and winter air temperatures contributed to earlier ice breakup; whereas warmer November temperatures delayed lake freeze. Lake ice breakup is projected to be 13 days earlier on average by 2070, but could vary by 3 days later to 43 days earlier depending upon the degree of climatic warming by late century. Similarly, the timing of lake freeze up is projected to be delayed by 11 days on average by 2070, but could be 1 to 28 days later. Shortened seasonality of ice cover by 24 days could increase risk of algal blooms, reduce habitat for coldwater fisheries, and jeopardize survival of northern communities reliant on ice roads.","[Hewitt, Bailey A.; Lopez, Lianna S.; Gaibisels, Katrina M.; Murdoch, Alyssa; Sharma, Sapna] York Univ, Dept Biol, 4700 Keele St, Toronto, ON M3J 1P3, Canada; [Higgins, Scott N.] IISD Expt Lakes Area Inc, Winnipeg, MB R3B 0T4, Canada; [Magnuson, John J.] Univ Wisconsin, Ctr Limnol, Madison, WI 53706 USA; [Paterson, Andrew M.; Rusak, James A.; Yao, Huaxia] Ontario Minist Environm & Climate Change, Dorset Environm Sci Ctr, Dorset, ON P0A 1E0, Canada",,"Sharma, S (corresponding author), York Univ, Dept Biol, 4700 Keele St, Toronto, ON M3J 1P3, Canada.",bailey24@yorku.ca; liannalopez18@gmail.com; k.gaibisels@gmail.com; alyssamurdoch@gmail.com; shiggins@iisd-ela.org; john.magnuson@wisc.edu; Andrew.Paterson@ontario.ca; Jim.Rusak@ontario.ca; Huaxia.Yao@ontario.ca; sharma11@yorku.ca,,"Rusak, James/0000-0002-4939-6478; Yao, Huaxia/0000-0001-5875-7215; Higgins, Scott/0000-0001-9427-7024; Sharma, Sapna/0000-0003-4571-2768",Ontario Graduate Scholarship (OGS)Ontario Graduate Scholarship; Fowle Scholarship in Ecology; Enbridge Graduate Student Award; Ministry of Environment and Climate Change award; Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council (NSERC)Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada (NSERC); NSERC Postgraduate Scholarship Doctoral Award (PGS-D); NSERC Collaborative Research and Training Experience Program; Early Researcher Award; Division Of Environmental BiologyNational Science Foundation (NSF)NSF - Directorate for Biological Sciences (BIO) [1440297] Funding Source: National Science Foundation,"We thank Ron Ingram for collecting and providing ice phenology data of Grandview Lake.

However, unveiling the specific mechanisms behind those patterns remains logistically challenging, yet necessary for reliable biodiversity forecasts. Here, we combine theory and experiments to investigate the processes underlying spatial biodiversity patterns in dendritic, river-like landscapes, iconic examples of highly threatened ecosystems. We used geometric scaling properties, common to all rivers, to show that the distribution of biodiversity in these landscapes fundamentally depends on how ecological selection is modulated across space: while uniform ecological selection across the network leads to higher diversity in downstream confluences, this pattern can be inverted by disturbances when population turnover (i.e. local mortality) is higher upstream than downstream. Higher turnover in small headwater patches can slow down ecological selection, increasing local diversity in comparison to large downstream confluences. Our results show that disturbance-mediated slowing down of competitive exclusion can generate a specific transient signature in terms of biodiversity distribution when applied over a spatial gradient of disturbance, which is a common feature of many river landscapes.","[Harvey, Eric; Gounand, Isabelle; Fronhofer, Emanuel A.; Altermatt, Florian] Univ Zurich, Dept Evolutionary Biol & Environm Studies, Winterthurerstr 190, CH-8057 Zurich, Switzerland; [Harvey, Eric; Gounand, Isabelle; Fronhofer, Emanuel A.; Altermatt, Florian] Eawag, Swiss Fed Inst Aquat Sci & Technol, Dept Aquat Ecol, Uberlandstr 133, CH-8600 Dubendorf, Switzerland; [Harvey, Eric] Univ Toronto, Dept Ecol & Evolutionary Biol, Toronto, ON M5S 3B2, Canada; [Fronhofer, Emanuel A.] Univ Montpellier, ISEM, EDPHE, CNRS,IRD, Montpellier, France",,"Harvey, E (corresponding author), Univ Zurich, Dept Evolutionary Biol & Environm Studies, Winterthurerstr 190, CH-8057 Zurich, Switzerland.; Harvey, E (corresponding author), Eawag, Swiss Fed Inst Aquat Sci & Technol, Dept Aquat Ecol, Uberlandstr 133, CH-8600 Dubendorf, Switzerland.; Harvey, E (corresponding author), Univ Toronto, Dept Ecol & Evolutionary Biol, Toronto, ON M5S 3B2, Canada.",eric.harvey@umontreal.ca,"Harvey, Eric/L-7029-2019; Fronhofer, Emanuel A./AAY-3186-2021; Fronhofer, Emanuel A./J-9784-2013","Fronhofer, Emanuel A./0000-0002-2219-784X; Fronhofer, Emanuel A./0000-0002-2219-784X; Altermatt, Florian/0000-0002-4831-6958; Gounand, Isabelle/0000-0002-0675-3973; Harvey, Eric/0000-0002-8601-7326","Swiss National Science FoundationSwiss National Science Foundation (SNSF)European Commission [PP00P3_150698, PP00P3_179089]; University of Zurich; Eawag","Funding is from the Swiss National Science Foundation grant no.

It can be concluded that the machine learning-based models have the potential for monthly streamflow forecasting. (2) The MSES can effectively reconstruct the original training data in the first layer and optimize the XGB model in the second layer, improving the forecast performance. We believe that the MSES is a computing framework worthy of development, with simple mathematical structure and low computational cost.

However, the forecast lead time of long-term streamflow forecasting is relatively long and the forecasted precipitation within the forecast lead time has inherent uncertainty, so long-term streamflow forecasting has major challenges. In this paper, a hybrid forecasting model is developed to improve accuracy of long-term streamflow forecasting by combining random forests (RF) and the Soil and Water Assessment Tool (SWAT). The RF model is used to forecast monthly precipitation which is further downscaled to a daily dataset according to the hydrological similarity principle for use in the SWAT model of the Danjiangkou Reservoir basin, China. Performance of this hybrid model is compared to that of seasonal autoregressive (SAR (P)) model. Results show the RF precipitation generator yields accurate predictions at the monthly scale and the hybrid model produces acceptable streamflow series in long-term forecasting cases. In addition, the comparison shows that in the Danjiangkou Reservoir basin, the hybrid model performs better than the SAR (P) model, with average Nash-Sutcliffe efficiency (NSE) values of 0.94 and 0.51, which is better when it is closer to 1.

The Niagara River transports a continental-scale flow (with an annual mean of roughly6,300 m3/s) that supports the economy of both the United States and Canada through hydropower generation, tourism, and other activities. The river also serves as a link connecting the two most downstream lakes (Lakes Erie and Ontario) in the largest system of lakes on Earth. Despite its significance, the authors know of no federally operated, short-term forecasting system for the Niagara River. Hydropower facilities management and other water resources management activities on the river have historically relied on an array of experimental, in-house, or proprietary models to simulate and forecast Niagara River flows. The study presented here fills this gap in large-scale hydraulic modeling and engineering science by calibrating a HEC-RAS model for the Upper Niagara River and customizing it to meet the operational requirements of the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) National Weather Service (NWS) Northeast River Forecasting Center (NERFC). The skill of the new forecasting system, which was recently deployed in its operational environment at the NERFC, will depend in large part on the accuracy of meteorological boundary conditions.

Disaster management is one of the main fields embracing the techniques of AI. It is essential to forecast the occurrence of disasters in advance to take the necessary mitigation steps and reduce damage to life and property. Therefore, many types of research are conducted to predict such events due to climate change in advance using hydrological, mathematical, and AI-based approaches. This paper presents a comparison of three major accepted AI-based approaches in flood and drought forecasting. In this study, fluvial floods are measured by the runoff change in rivers whereas meteorological droughts are measured using the Standard Precipitation Index (SPI). The performance of the Convolutional Neural Network (CNN), Long-Short Term Memory network (LSTM), and Wavelet decomposition functions combined with the Adaptive NeuroFuzzy Inference System (WANFIS) are compared in flood and drought forecasting, with five statistical performance criteria and accepted flood and drought indicators used for comparison, extending to two climatic regions: arid and tropical. The results suggest that the CNN performs best in flood forecasting with WANFIS for meteorological drought forecasting, regardless of the climate of the region under study. Besides, the results demonstrate the increased accuracy of the CNN in applications with multiple features in the input.","[Adikari, Kasuni E.; Shrestha, Sangam; Budhathoki, Aakanchya; Mohanasundaram, S.] Asian Inst Technol, Water Engn & Management, Pathum Thani 12120, Thailand; [Ratnayake, Dhanika T.] Asian Inst Technol, Ind Syst Engn, Pathum Thani 12120, Thailand; [Dailey, Matthew N.] Asian Inst Technol, Dept Informat & Commun Technol, Pathum Thani 12120, Thailand; [Budhathoki, Aakanchya] Kyoto Univ, Dept Civil & Earth Resources Engn, Nishikyo Ku, Kyoto 6158540, Japan",,"Shrestha, S (corresponding author), Asian Inst Technol, Water Engn & Management, Pathum Thani 12120, Thailand.",sangam@ait.asia,,"Adikari, Kasuni/0000-0001-9062-2134; Ratnayake, Dhanika/0000-0003-2012-3449",USAID (Thailand)United States Agency for International Development (USAID) [6-436]; USAID (Cambodia) [6-436]; Asian Institute of Technology; Stockholm Environmental Institute; Inland Fisheries Research and Development Institute; Arizona State University,"The authors would like to express their sincere gratitude to the USAID funded PEER project Connecting climate change, hydrology, and fisheries for energy and food security in Lower Mekong Basin (Thailand and Cambodia - Project 6-436) carried out in co-operation with the Asian Institute of Technology, Stockholm Environmental Institute, Inland Fisheries Research and Development Institute, and Arizona State University.",,56,0,0,13,13,ELSEVIER SCI LTD,OXFORD,"THE BOULEVARD, LANGFORD LANE, KIDLINGTON, OXFORD OX5 1GB, OXON, ENGLAND",1364-8152,1873-6726,,ENVIRON MODELL SOFTW,Environ.

The goal of this research is to develop a reliable stochastic model for the monthly streamflow of the Blue Nile at Eldiem station, where the Grand Ethiopian Renaissance Dam (GERD) is currently under construction with a storage capacity of about 74 billion m(3). The developed model may help to carry out a reliable study on the filling scenarios of GERD reservoir and to minimize its expected negative side effects on Sudan and Egypt.

The performance of extended range forecasts for the southwest monsoon seasons clearly captured the intra-seasonal variability of monsoon including delay/early onset of monsoon, active/break spells of monsoon and also withdrawal of monsoon in the real time in providing guidance for various applications. The MME based ERF also provides encouraging results to provide useful guidance upto 2/3 weeks about northeast monsoon and cyclogenesis potential during October to December (OND) over the north Indian Ocean, heat wave, cold wave during summer and winter with statistically significant correlation coefficient (CC) upto two weeks. For applications in agriculture sector meteorological subdivision level forecasts are prepared for two weeks for the purpose of agro advisory.

We used the baseline data (S-B) and 13 potential NF scenarios to evaluate the effects of changes in land use, temperature and precipitation, both in isolation and in combined scenarios by application of the Soil and Water Assessment Tool (SWAT). Climate changes (CC) were represented by the delta change approach based on trends for past 3 (1985-2014) or last decade (2005-2014), respectively (low delta change (LDC) and high delta change (HDC)), where the trends of the most recent decade yield a higher delta change when extrapolating to 2030. Similarly, land use changes were derived from trends observed based from satellite imagery and Cellular Automata-Markov model (CAM). In the NF, the results indicated that the climate would universally become warmer and drier under both LDC and HDC and increase the high-consumption land uses such as orchards in the study area, respectively. In 2030, CC tend to effect more conspicuously the HR than LU changes, leading to decrease in the entire hydrological component except evapotranspiration. Surveying the whole array of the simulated scenarios, there were clear and non-linear synergistic effects of the combination of LU and CC scenarios, and taking into account both of these is, therefore, critically important if model results are to be used for decision-making support.","[Andaryani, Soghra; Nikjoo, M.

An efficient flood forecasting and warning method is crucial for ensuring adequate lead time. With this objective, this paper proposes an analysis method for a flood forecasting and warning system, and establishes the criteria for issuing urban-stream flash flood warnings based on the amount of rainfall to allow sufficient lead time. The proposed methodology is a nonstructural approach to flood prediction and risk reduction. It considers water level fluctuations during a rainfall event and estimates the upstream (alert point) and downstream (confluence) water levels for water level analysis based on the rainfall intensity and duration. We also investigate the rainfall/runoff and flow rate/water level relationships using the Hydrologic Engineering Center's Hydrologic Modeling System (HEC-HMS) and the HEC's River Analysis System (HEC-RAS) models, respectively, and estimate the rainfall threshold for issuing flash flood warnings depending on the backwater state based on actual watershed conditions. We present a methodology for issuing flash flood warnings at a critical point by considering the effects of fluctuations in various backwater conditions in real time, which will provide practical support for decision making by disaster protection workers. The results are compared with real-time water level observations of the Dorim Stream. Finally, we verify the validity of the flash flood warning criteria by comparing the predicted values with the observed values and performing validity analysis.","[Song, Yangho; Lee, Jungho] Hanbat Natl Univ, Dept Civil & Environm Engn, Daejeon 34158, South Korea; [Park, Yoonkyung] Deepcloud Co Ltd, Corp Affiliated Res Inst, Busan 48058, South Korea; [Park, Moojong] Hanseo Univ, Dept Aeronaut & Civil Engn, Seosan 31962, South Korea; [Song, Youngseok] Daegu Tech Univ, Dept Civil Engn & Landscape Architectural, Daegu 42734, South Korea",,"Song, Y (corresponding author), Daegu Tech Univ, Dept Civil Engn & Landscape Architectural, Daegu 42734, South Korea.",kind711@hanmail.net,"Song, Yangho/AAS-7502-2020","Song, Yangho/0000-0002-3937-3547",Korea Meteorological Administration Research and Development Program [2018-03010],This work was funded by the Korea Meteorological Administration Research and Development Program under Grant KMI (2018-03010).,,26,7,7,1,9,MDPI,BASEL,"ST ALBAN-ANLAGE 66, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND",,2073-4441,,WATER-SUI,Water,AUG,2019,11,8,,,,,,,1571,10.3390/w11081571,,,21,Environmental Sciences; Water Resources,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),Environmental Sciences & Ecology; Water Resources,IV9CM,WOS:000484561500045,,gold,,,2022-02-17

This study examines the hypothesis that medium-range forecasts of heavy precipitation at the basin scale exhibit recurrent spatial biases that are driven by mesoscale and synoptic-scale features of associated AR events. This hypothesis is tested for heavy precipitation events in the Sacramento River basin using 36 years of NCEP medium-range reforecasts from 1984 to 2019. For each event we cluster precipitation forecast error across western North America for lead times ranging from 1 to 15 days. Integrated vapor transport (PVT), 500-hPa geopotential heights, and landfall characteristics of ARs are composited across clusters and lead times to diagnose the causes of precipitation forecast biases. We investigate the temporal evolution of forecast error to characterize its persistence across lead times, and explore the accuracy of forecasted IVT anomalies across different domains of the North American west coast during heavy precipitation events in the Sacramento basin. Our results identify recurrent spatial patterns of precipitation forecast error consistent with errors of forecasted synoptic-scale features, especially at long (5-15 days) leads. Moreover, we find evidence that forecasts of AR landfalls well outside of the latitudinal bounds of the Sacramento basin precede heavy precipitation events within the basin. These results suggest the potential for using medium-range forecasts of large-scale climate features across the Pacific-North American sector, rather than just local forecasts of basin-scale precipitation, when designing forecast-informed reservoir operations.","[Brodeur, Zachary P.; Steinschneider, Scott] Cornell Univ, Dept Biol & Environm Engn, New York, NY 14850 USA",,"Brodeur, ZP; Steinschneider, S (corresponding author), Cornell Univ, Dept Biol & Environm Engn, New York, NY 14850 USA.",zpb4@cornell.edu; ss3378@cornell.edu,,"Brodeur, Zachary/0000-0001-5242-7696",U.S. National Science FoundationNational Science Foundation (NSF) [EnvS-1803563],Wethank two anonymous reviewers for their constructive feedback on this work.

Among other purposes, such forecasting systems are expected to support better water management decisions. In this paper we evaluate the potential use of a real-time optimization system (RTOS) informed by seasonal forecasts in a water supply system in the UK. For this purpose, we simulate the performances of the RTOS fed by ECMWF seasonal forecasting systems (SEAS5) over the past 10 years, and we compare them to a benchmark operation that mimics the common practices for reservoir operation in the UK. We also attempt to link the improvement of system performances, i.e. the forecast value, to the forecast skill (measured by the mean error and the continuous ranked probability skill score) as well as to the bias correction of the meteorological forcing, the decision maker priorities, the hydrological conditions and the forecast ensemble size. We find that in particular the decision maker priorities and the hydrological conditions exert a strong influence on the forecast skill-value relationship. For the (realistic) scenario where the decision maker prioritizes the water resource availability over energy cost reductions, we identify clear operational benefits from using seasonal forecasts, provided that forecast uncertainty is explicitly considered by optimizing against an ensemble of 25 equiprobable forecasts. These operational benefits are also observed when the ensemble size is reduced up to a certain limit However, when comparing the use of ECMWF-SEAS5 products to ensemble streamflow prediction (ESP), which is more easily derived from historical weather data, we find that ESP remains a hard-to-beat reference, not only in terms of skill but also in terms of value.","[Penuela, Andres; Pianosi, Francesca] Univ Bristol, Civil Engn, Bristol BS8 1TR, Avon, England; [Hutton, Christopher] Wessex Water Serv Ltd, Bath BA2 7WW, Avon, England; [Pianosi, Francesca] Univ Bristol, Cabot Inst, Bristol BS8 1UH, Avon, England",,"Penuela, A (corresponding author), Univ Bristol, Civil Engn, Bristol BS8 1TR, Avon, England.",andres.penuela-fernandez@bristol.ac.uk,"Penuela, Andres/G-7529-2016; Pianosi, Francesca/L-3154-2018","Penuela, Andres/0000-0001-8039-975X; Pianosi, Francesca/0000-0002-1516-2163",Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council (EPSRC)UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Engineering & Physical Sciences Research Council (EPSRC) [EP/R007330/1]; EPSRCUK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Engineering & Physical Sciences Research Council (EPSRC) [EP/R007330/1] Funding Source: UKRI,This research has been supported by the Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council (EPSRC) (grant no.

Selected physicochemical parameters of waters were marked in the study. The water was collected from 19 wells located close to a shale gas extraction site. The water quality index was determined from the obtained parameters. A secondary objective of the study was to test the capacity of the artificial neural network (ANN) methods to model the water quality index in groundwater. The number of ANN input parameters was optimized and limited to seven, which was derived using a multiple regression model. Subsequently, using the stepwise regression method, models with ever fewer variables were tested. The best parameters were obtained for a network with five input neurons (electrical conductivity, pH as well as calcium, magnesium and sodium ions), in addition to five neurons in the hidden layer. The results showed that the use of the parameters is a convenient approach to modeling water quality index with satisfactory and appropriate accuracy. Artificial neural network methods exhibited the capacity to predict water quality index at the desirable level of accuracy (RMSE = 0.651258, R = 0.9992 and R-2 = 0.9984). Neural network models can thus be used to directly predict the quality of groundwater, particularly in industrial areas. This proposed method, using advanced artificial intelligence, can aid in water treatment and management.

Applying an Ensemble Smoother Multiple Data Assimilation (ES-MDA) framework, the workflow updates geologic properties and predicts reservoir performance with quantified uncertainty from pressure history and CO2 plumes interpreted through seismic inversion. As the most computationally expensive component in such a workflow is reservoir simulation, we developed surrogate models to predict dynamic pressure and CO2 plume extents under multi-well injection. The surrogate models employ deep convolutional neural networks, specifically, a wide residual network and a residual U-Net. The workflow is validated against a flat three-dimensional reservoir model representative of a elastic shelf depositional environment. Intelligent treatments are applied to bridge between quantities in a true-3D reservoir model and those in a single-layer reservoir model. The workflow can complete history matching and reservoir forecasting with uncertainty quantification in less than one hour on a mainstream personal workstation.","[Tang, Hewei; Fu, Pengcheng; Sherman, Christopher S.; Ju, Xin; Morris, Joseph P.] Lawrence Livermore Natl Lab, Atmospher Earth & Energy Div, Livermore, CA 94550 USA; [Zhang, Jize] Lawrence Livermore Natl Lab, Ctr Appl Sci Comp, Livermore, CA 94550 USA; [Hamon, Francois] Total E&P Res & Technol, Houston, TX 77002 USA; [Azzolina, Nicholas A.; Burton-Kelly, Matthew] Univ North Dakota, Energy & Environm Res Ctr, Grand Forks, ND 58202 USA",,"Fu, PC (corresponding author), Lawrence Livermore Natl Lab, Atmospher Earth & Energy Div, Livermore, CA 94550 USA.",fu4@llnl.gov,,,"US.

In Canada, each province is responsible for collecting and managing meteorological and hydrometric data (through provincial authorities and/or under Federal/Provincial agreements), developing suitable hydrological models, and providing information about river discharge and water level to the public. In case of an extreme event such as flood or drought, the forecast center is responsible for issuing alerts and supporting provincial emergency management. Due to the large diversity in landscape, weather, and hydrological features across the country, extreme events are triggered by different mechanisms such as snowmelt, heavy rainfall, rain on snow, etc., at different times of the year. Each river forecast center deals with unique challenges in data collection, hydrologic/hydraulic modeling, and flood forecasting. Thus, the focus of the Center in planning for developments and future directions could be significantly different from one province to another. In this paper, the significance of river flood forecasting in Canada, as well as the development in hydrological modelling procedures are highlighted. Moreover, an overview of the current approaches for streamflow/flood forecasting used by the Centers is provided. The content presented here is an outcome of our interaction with the forecast centers.

However, owing to climate changes and human activities, natural runoff often contains a variety of frequency components, and existing monthly runoff estimation techniques may fail to capture potential change processes effectively. To overcome this problem, we have developed a hybrid model for monthly runoff prediction. First, observed runoff is decomposed into several subcomponents via variational mode decomposition. Second, support vector machine models based on quantum-behaved particle swarm optimization are adopted to identify the input-output relationships hidden in each subcomponent. Finally, the total output of all submodules is treated as the final forecasting result for the original runoff. Three quantitative indexes are considered to test the performance of the developed models. The monthly streamflow of two reservoirs in China's Yangtze Valley is considered as the survey target. This area contains the world's largest hydropower project (Three Gorges Reservoir) and the waterhead of the middle line of Asia's largest inter-basin water transfer project (Danjiangkou Reservoir). Test results indicate that the hybrid model provides better forecasting accuracy compared to several traditional methods (artificial neural networks and extreme learning machines), making it an effective tool for the scientific operation of hydropower reservoirs.","[Feng, Zhong-kai; Jiang, Zhi-qiang; Liu, Yi] Huazhong Univ Sci & Technol, Sch Hydropower & Informat Engn, Wuhan 430074, Peoples R China; [Niu, Wen-jing] ChangJiang Water Resources Commiss, Bur Hydrol, Wuhan 430010, Peoples R China; [Tang, Zheng-yang; Xu, Yang; Zhang, Hai-rong] China Yangtze Power Co Ltd, Dept Water Resources Management, Yichang 443133, Peoples R China",,"Feng, ZK (corresponding author), Huazhong Univ Sci & Technol, Sch Hydropower & Informat Engn, Wuhan 430074, Peoples R China.",myfellow@163.com,"Feng, Zhong-kai/H-7069-2012","Feng, Zhong-kai/0000-0002-0166-8956",National Natural Science Foundation of ChinaNational Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC) [51709119]; Natural Science Foundation of Hubei ProvinceNatural Science Foundation of Hubei Province [2018CFB573]; Fundamental Research Funds for the Central UniversitiesFundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities [HUST: 2017KFYXJJ193],"This paper is supported by the National Natural Science Foundation of China (51709119), Natural Science Foundation of Hubei Province (2018CFB573) and the Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities (HUST: 2017KFYXJJ193).

An overview of the design schemes of the AOGCM river runoff used in the research is made. The methodology uses an ensemble approach. The predictive estimates were carried out for two forecast periods 2021-2040 and 2041-2060 in relation to the period 1981-20 0 0, which was chosen as the base one. The calculations were made on the basis of an ensemble of 24 selected models for both the moderately aggressive RCP4.5 scenario and the hard RCP8.5 scenario. The results obtained were averaged over 20-year periods and compared with the corresponding values for the period 1981-20 0 0. According to the results obtained, in the coming decades there is no reason to expect any significant changes in river flow as a result of climate change. For most of the country's territory, a slight increase in annual runoff is most likely, which is within the limits of its natural variability. The most abundant river water resources will be the Asian part of the Russian Federation and the adjacent eastern part of the European territory of Russia. The most problematic from the point of view of water resources provision will be the Central Black Earth, North Caucasus and Volga economic regions. There will be more water in those regions where it is sufficient, and less where it is most needed. It should be noted that the technique presented in this article is considered by the authors primarily as one of the alternative forecasting methods that must be used in conjunction with other accepted methods. However, given the continuous process of improving the AOGCMs, as well as the quality of the information they provide, this approach should be considered as one of the most promising.

The objective of this study is to model the monthly water demand in Kuwait using the nonlinear autoregressive with exogenous input (NARX) neural network approach. The country lacks conventional surface water resources and is characterized by extremely arid climate. In addition, it has one of the fastest growing populations. In this study, linear detrending is performed on the water consumption time series for the period from January 1993 to December 2018 to eliminate the influence of population growth before application to the NARX model. Monthly temperature data are selected as exogenous input to the NARX model, because they are strongly associated with the water consumption data. Correlation analyses are performed to determine the input and feedback delays of the NARX model. The results demonstrate that the recurrent NARX model is efficient and robust for forecasting the short-term water demand, with a Nash-Sutcliffe (NS) coefficient of 0.837 in the validation period. Seasonal model assessment shows that the model performs best during the critical summer season. The NARX-based recurrent model is established as a powerful and promising tool for predicting urban water demand. Thus, it can efficiently aid the development of resilient water supply plans.","[Alsumaiei, Abdullah A.] Kuwait Univ, Coll Engn & Petr, Civil Engn Dept, POB 5969, Safat 13060, Kuwait",,"Alsumaiei, AA (corresponding author), Kuwait Univ, Coll Engn & Petr, Civil Engn Dept, POB 5969, Safat 13060, Kuwait.",alsumaiei.a@ku.edu.kw,,,,,,35,0,0,2,2,ACADEMIC PUBLICATION COUNCIL,KHALDIYA,"PO BOX 17225, KHALDIYA 72453, KUWAIT",2307-1877,2307-1885,,J ENG RES-KUWAIT,J.

In catchments with seasonal snow cover, snowmelt is an important flood-generating process. Hence, high-quality air temperature data are important to accurately forecast streamflows. The sensitivity of streamflow ensemble forecasts to the calibration of temperature ensemble forecasts was investigated using ensemble forecasts of temperature from the European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts (ECMWF) covering a period of nearly 3 years, from 1 March 2013 to 31 December 2015. To improve the skill and reduce biases of the temperature ensembles, the Norwegian Meteorological Institute (MET Norway) provided parameters for ensemble calibration, derived using a standard quantile mapping method where HIRLAM, a high-resolution regional weather prediction model, was used as reference. A lumped HBV (Hydrologiska Byrans Vatten-balansavdelning) model, distributed on 10 elevation zones, was used to estimate the streamflow. The results show that temperature ensemble calibration affected both temperature and streamflow forecast skill, but differently depending on season and region. We found a close to 1 : 1 relationship between temperature and streamflow skill change for the spring season, whereas for autumn and winter large temperature skill improvements were not reflected in the streamflow forecasts to the same degree. This can be explained by streamflow being less affected by subzero temperature improvements, which accounted for the biggest temperature biases and corrections during autumn and winter. The skill differs between regions. In particular, there is a cold bias in the forecasted temperature during autumn and winter along the coast, enabling a large improvement by calibration. The forecast skill was partly related to elevation differences and catchment area. Overall, it is evident that temperature forecasts are important for streamflow forecasts in climates with seasonal snow cover.","[Hegdahl, Trine J.; Engeland, Kolbjorn] Norwegian Water Resources & Energy Directorate, Dept Hydrol, N-0301 Oslo, Norway; [Engeland, Kolbjorn; Tallaksen, Lena M.] Univ Oslo, Dept Geosci, N-0316 Oslo, Norway; [Steinsland, Ingelin] Norwegian Univ Sci & Technol, Dept Math Sci, N-7034 Trondheim, Norway",,"Hegdahl, TJ (corresponding author), Norwegian Water Resources & Energy Directorate, Dept Hydrol, N-0301 Oslo, Norway.",tjh@nve.no,,"Engeland, Kolbjorn/0000-0003-1081-8570; Tallaksen, Lena M/0000-0002-8480-7842",,,,55,2,2,1,4,COPERNICUS GESELLSCHAFT MBH,GOTTINGEN,"BAHNHOFSALLEE 1E, GOTTINGEN, 37081, GERMANY",1027-5606,1607-7938,,HYDROL EARTH SYST SC,Hydrol.

The term streamflow drought forecasting (not streamflow forecasting), however, has created confusion within the scientific hydrometeorological community as well as in operational weather and water management services. Streamflow drought forecasting requires an additional step, which is the application of a drought identification method to the forecasted streamflow time series. The way streamflow drought is identified is the main reason for this misperception. The purpose of this study, therefore, is to provide a comprehensive overview of the differences between different drought identification approaches to identify droughts in European rivers, including an analysis of both historical drought and implications for forecasting. Streamflow data were obtained from the LISFLOOD hydrological model forced with gridded meteorological observations (known as LISFLOOD-Simulation Forced with Observed, SFO). The same model fed with seasonal meteorological forecasts of the European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts system 5 (ECMWF SEAS 5) was used to obtain the forecasted streamflow. Streamflow droughts were analyzed using the daily and monthly variable threshold methods (VTD and VTM, respectively), the daily and monthly fixed threshold methods (FTD and FTM, respectively), and the Standardized Streamflow Index (SSI). Our results clearly show that streamflow droughts derived from different approaches deviate from each other in their characteristics, which also vary in different climate regions across Europe. The daily threshold methods (FTD and VTD) identify 25 %-50 % more drought events than the monthly threshold methods (FTM and VTM), and accordingly the average drought duration is longer for the monthly than for the daily threshold methods. The FTD and FTM, in general, identify drought occurrences earlier in the year than the VTD and VTM. In addition, the droughts obtained with the VTM and FTM approaches also have higher drought deficit volumes (about 25 %-30 %) than the VTD and FTD approaches. Overall, the characteristics of SSI-1 drought are close to what is being identified by the VTM. The different outcome obtained with the drought identification methods illustrated with the historical analysis is also found in drought forecasting, as documented for the 2003 drought across Europe and for the Rhine River specifically. In the end, there is no unique hydrological drought definition (identification method) that fits all purposes, and hence developers of DEWS and end-users should clearly agree in the co-design phase upon a sharp definition of which type of streamflow drought is required to be forecasted for a specific application.","[Sutanto, Samuel J.; Van Lanen, Henny A.

We presented a forecasting framework for EFs, IFA and EF satisfaction degree to assess suitable EFs (minimum or threshold) and forecast EF satisfaction degree over the next 20 years. First, we investigated the temporal and spatial distribution characteristics of IFA using statistical analysis and Morlet wavelet analysis of the hydrologic series from 1919 to 2013. Second, forecasting models of IFA were established using hydrologic stochastic simulation based on wavelet analysis. Then, abrupt shifts of baseflow index (BI) were identified based on Mann-Kendall trend detection test. Subsequently, regressions models were developed between a normalized BI and the effect size (ES) of zoobenthos and fish species richness. Accordingly, EFs were calculated. Finally, the IFA and EF satisfaction degree for the forecasting years were calculated. Results show that thresholds of BI, with 0.8 and 0.4 as the lower limit, and 2.3 and 1.1 as the upper limit, were recommended as the limit percentage of the EFs standard during flood and non-flood seasons, respectively. An overall decreasing tendency of IFA was observed in all the seven stations from the 1910s to 2010s, which is especially particularly significant in the lower reaches in the past two or three decades. One major EFs deficit spell occurred throughout the river beginning in the 1990s. Forecasting results indicate that the IFA will satisfy the EFs for the stations located in the upper and middle reaches by 2020 and 2030, except for the stations in the lower reaches. Contradictions of EFs and IFA will be even graver in the future. The results will have important implications for the water management of the riverine ecosystem. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd.

In particular, they provide a unique insight into the hydrodynamics of the surface ocean and phytoplankton phenology. This information can be combined with in-situ observations of higher trophic levels to understand the functioning of the marine ecosystem, with potential use for fisheries and aquaculture. In the Gulf of Maine, off the eastern seaboard of North America, Georges Bank is one of the world's most productive natural sea scallop (Placopecten magellanicus) fisheries, which sustains economically valuable fisheries in Canada and the US. In Canada, the relationship between the scallop meat weight and its shell height (known as scallop condition) is used to obtain biomass estimates for stock assessment and thereby influences the fishing quotas. On Georges Bank, for a 100 mm shell height scallop, scallop condition has varied significantly interannually between 10.2 g and 19.5 g. Establishing a relationship between environmental factors and scallop condition would improve the forecasting of scallop biomass and reduce the uncertainty when determining the total allowable catch for the subsequent fishing season. In this study, satellite remote-sensed sea-surface temperature (SST) and chlorophyll-a concentration (Chia) coupled with in-situ measurements of scallop condition (SC) on Georges Bank were used to assess the relationship between SC and satellite-derived environmental conditions between 1985 and 2019 for SST and between 1998 and 2019 for Chla. The inter-annual variation of SC in May was found to be positively correlated (p-value <0.001) with the variation in SST in winter-spring months of the current and previous year of the SC survey. An empirical linear model for the estimation of SC was developed and validated using two independent datasets of satellite SST (r(2) = 0.64, MAPD = 7%). Another model using cumulative SST in the previous year only was also provided (r(2) = 0.58, MAPD = 7.7%), which could serve as an alternative choice when the SST products in the current year are not yet available for use. There was a weak relationship observed between SC and Chla; this is likely due to the influence of water-column vertical mixing on transport of phytoplankton to the benthic zone where the sea scallop resides. Our study indicates that a cost-effective satellite-derived SST product can be used to improve predictions of SC and provide useful information and decision support tools for managing scallop stocks.","[Liu, Xiaohan; Devred, Emmanuel; Johnson, Catherine L.; Keith, Dave; Sameoto, Jessica A.] Fisheries & Oceans Canada, Bedford Inst Oceanog, POB 1006, Dartmouth, NS B2Y 4A2, Canada; [Liu, Xiaohan] Plymouth Marine Lab, Plymouth PL1 3DH, Devon, England",,"Liu, XH (corresponding author), Plymouth Marine Lab, Plymouth PL1 3DH, Devon, England.",liux@pml.ac.uk,,,"Strategic Program for the Ecosystem-based Research and Advice (SPERA) program, Fisheries and Oceans Canada","This study was funded by the Strategic Program for the Ecosystem-based Research and Advice (SPERA) program, Fisheries and Oceans Canada.

For this purpose, a regional hydrologic ensemble prediction system (RHEPS) is developed and implemented. The RHEPS is comprised of the following components: (i) hydrometeorological observations (multisensor precipitation estimates, gridded surface temperature, and gauged streamflow); (ii) weather ensemble forecasts (precipitation and near-surface temperature) from the National Centers for Environmental Prediction 11-member Global Ensemble Forecast System Re-forecast version 2 (GEFSRv2); (iii) NOAA's Hydrology Laboratory-Research Distributed Hydrologic Model (HL-RDHM); (iv) heteroscedastic censored logistic regression (HCLR) as the statistical preprocessor; (v) two statistical postprocessors, an autoregressive model with a single exogenous variable (ARX(1,1)) and quantile regression (QR); and (vi) a comprehensive verification strategy. To implement the RHEPS, 1 to 7 days weather forecasts from the GEFSRv2 are used to force HL-RDHM and generate raw ensemble streamflow forecasts. Forecasting experiments are conducted in four nested basins in the US Middle Atlantic region, ranging in size from 381 to 12 362 km(2). Results show that the HCLR preprocessed ensemble precipitation forecasts have greater skill than the raw forecasts. These improvements are more noticeable in the warm season at the longer lead times (>3 days). Both postprocessors, ARX(1,1) and QR, show gains in skill relative to the raw ensemble streamflow forecasts, particularly in the cool season, but QR outperforms ARX(1,1). The scenarios that implement preprocessing and postprocessing separately tend to perform similarly, although the postprocessing-alone scenario is often more effective. The scenario involving both preprocessing and postprocessing consistently outperforms the other scenarios. In some cases, however, the differences between this scenario and the scenario with postprocessing alone are not as significant. We conclude that implementing both preprocessing and postprocessing ensures the most skill improvements, but postprocessing alone can often be a competitive alternative.","[Sharma, Sanjib; Mejia, Alfonso] Penn State Univ, Dept Civil & Environm Engn, University Pk, PA 16802 USA; [Siddique, Ridwan] Univ Massachusetts, Northeast Climate Sci Ctr, Amherst, MA 01003 USA; [Reed, Seann; Ahnert, Peter] Middle Atlantic River Forecast Ctr, Natl Weather Serv, State Coll, PA USA; [Mendoza, Pablo] Univ Chile, AMTC, Santiago, Chile",,"Sharma, S; Mejia, A (corresponding author), Penn State Univ, Dept Civil & Environm Engn, University Pk, PA 16802 USA.",sanjibsharma66@gmail.com; amejia@engr.psu.edu,"Sharma, Sanjib/R-4989-2019; Mendoza, Pablo/AAT-2649-2021","Mendoza, Pablo/0000-0002-0263-9698; Mejia, Alfonso/0000-0003-3891-1822",NOAA/NWSNational Oceanic Atmospheric Admin (NOAA) - USA [NA14NWS4680012],We acknowledge the funding support provided by the NOAA/NWS through award NA14NWS4680012.,,88,15,15,0,13,COPERNICUS GESELLSCHAFT MBH,GOTTINGEN,"BAHNHOFSALLEE 1E, GOTTINGEN, 37081, GERMANY",1027-5606,1607-7938,,HYDROL EARTH SYST SC,Hydrol.

Machine learning (ML) models, namely, the Group Method of Data Handling (GMDH), Chi-square Automatic Interaction Detector (CHAID), and Random Forest (RF) were simulated for one, three and seven days ahead streamflow forecasting. Additionally, the developed forecasting models were improved through the integration with Intrinsic Time-scale decomposition (ITD) (by decomposing the input data into a series of proper rotation components (PRC) and a monotonic trend).

The combination of local weather dynamics, regional anthropogenic stresses and global environmental changes make the evaluation of monitoring information in dynamic freshwater systems a challenging task. While the lake ecosystems gather many complex biogeochemical interactions, they remain constrained by the same physical environment of mixing and transport. It is therefore crucial to obtain high quality physical system insight. Three-dimensional hydrodynamic models are perfectly suited for providing such information. However, these models are complex to implement, and their use is often limited to modellers. Here, we aim to provide model output via a user-friendly platform to a broad audience ranging from scientists to public and governmental stakeholders. We present a unified approach merging the apparently diverse interests through meteolakes.ch, an online platform openly disseminating lake observations and three-dimensional numerical simulations in near real-time with short-term forecasts and data assimilation. Meteolakes is scalable to a broad range of devices, modular and distributed, hence allowing its expansion to other regions and hardware infrastructures. Since 2016, the platform has continuously provided timely synoptic lake information to more than 250,000 users. This web-based system was built not only to provide guidance to scientists in the design and analysis of field experiments and to foster interdisciplinary lake studies, but also to assist governmental agencies and professionals in the long-term policy and planning of water resources management. Finally, our system aimed at promoting awareness and understanding of the complexity of lakes and providing information to the public through user-friendly, interfaces. This article details the design and operation of such a platform and its products. Applications are demonstrated by examples of a recent upwelling and a storm event. Both cases illustrate how Meteolakes help scientists in their quest for process understanding as well as water professionals and civil society in providing specific warnings. (C) 2020 The Authors.

Daily rainfall series for the future period is simulated using a calibrated weather generator based on generalized linear models. The simulated daily rainfall series are compared with the monthly predictions obtained from local polynomial regression model, and the best correlated daily rainfall simulation is transformed into stream flow using a calibrated and validated soil and water assessment tool to generate the daily inflow series. The modelling procedure was applied to a typical reservoir catchment in India. Diagnostic checks carried out to assess the performance of the rainfall simulations revealed that the simulated series are having the same statistical characteristics as that of the observed series.

This paper aims at implementing an ensemble forecasting system at the Senegal River upper the Manantali dam. Rainfall ensemble is obtained through harmonic analysis and an ARIMA stochastic process. Cyclical errors that are within rainfall cyclical behavior from the stochastic modeling are settled and processed using multivariate statistic tools to dress a rainfall ensemble forecast. The rainfall ensemble is used as input to run the HBV-light to product streamflow ensemble forecasts. A number of 61 forecasted rainfall time series are then used to run already calibrated hydrological model to produce hydrological ensemble forecasts called raw ensemble. In addition, the affine kernel dressing method is applied to the raw ensemble to obtain another ensemble. Both ensembles are evaluated using on the one hand deterministic verifications such the linear correlation, the mean error, the mean absolute error and the root-mean-squared error, and on the other hand, probabilistic scores (Brier score, rank probability score and continuous rank probability score) and diagrams (attribute diagram and relative operating characteristics curve). Results are satisfactory as at deterministic than probabilistic scale, particularly considering reliability, resolution and skill of the systems. For both ensembles, correlation between the averages of the members and corresponding observations is about 0.871. In addition, the dressing method globally improved the performances of ensemble forecasting system. Thus, both schemes system can help decision maker of the Manantali dam in water resources management.","[Ndione, Didier Maria; Sambou, Soussou; Kane, Seidou; Sane, Mousse Landing; Leye, Issa] Cheikh Anta Diop Univ UCAD, Fac Sci & Technol, Dept Phys, Hydraul & Fluids Mech Lab HFML, BP 5005, Dakar, Senegal; [Diatta, Samo] Environm & Climate Sci, Lab Oceanog, Ziguinchor, Senegal; [Diatta, Samo] Lab Atmospher & Ocean Phys, Dakar, Senegal",,"Ndione, DM (corresponding author), Cheikh Anta Diop Univ UCAD, Fac Sci & Technol, Dept Phys, Hydraul & Fluids Mech Lab HFML, BP 5005, Dakar, Senegal.",didiermaria.ndione@ucad.edu.sn,,,,,,66,1,1,0,2,SPRINGER HEIDELBERG,HEIDELBERG,"TIERGARTENSTRASSE 17, D-69121 HEIDELBERG, GERMANY",2190-5487,2190-5495,,APPL WATER SCI,Appl.

The high seasonal variability of rivers in cold weather regions poses a challenge to river flow forecasting, which tends to be complex and data demanding. This study proposes a novel technique to forecast flows that use a single-input sequential adaptive neuro-fuzzy inference system (ANFIS) along the Athabasca River in Alberta, Canada. After estimating the optimal lead time between four hydrometric stations, gauging data measured near the source were used to predict river flow near the mouth, over approximately 1000 km. The performance of this technique was compared to nonsequential and multi-input ANFISs, which use gauging data measured at each of the four hydrometric stations. The results show that a sequential ANFIS can accurately predict river flow (r(2)= 0.99, Nash-Sutcliffe = 0.98) with a longer lead time (6 days) by using a single input, compared to nonsequential and multi-input ANFIS (2 days). This method provides accurate predictions over large distances, allowing for flow forecasts over longer periods of time. Therefore, governmental agencies and community planners could utilize this technique to improve flood prevention and planning, operations, maintenance, and the administration of water resource systems.","[Belvederesi, Chiara; Dominic, John A.; Achari, Gopal] Univ Calgary, Schulich Sch Engn, Dept Civil Engn, Calgary, AB T2N 1N4, Canada; [Hassan, Quazi K.; Gupta, Anil] Univ Calgary, Schulich Sch Engn, Dept Geomat Engn, Calgary, AB T2N 1N4, Canada; [Gupta, Anil] Alberta Environm & Pk, Resource Stewardship Div, Univ Res Pk, Calgary, AB T2L 2K8, Canada",,"Hassan, QK (corresponding author), Univ Calgary, Schulich Sch Engn, Dept Geomat Engn, Calgary, AB T2N 1N4, Canada.",chiara.belvederesi@ucalgary.ca; johnalbino.dominic@ucalgary.ca; qhassan@ucalgary.ca; anil.gupta@gov.ab.ca; gachari@ucalgary.ca,,"Achari, Gopal/0000-0002-4837-9801; Hassan, Quazi K./0000-0002-7034-359X; Gupta, Anil/0000-0002-5645-7435",Alberta Environment and Parks; Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of CanadaNatural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada (NSERC)CGIAR,This research was partially funded by: (i) Alberta Environment and Parks through a grant to Q.

In this study, we introduce a novel attention-based Long-Short Term Memory (LSTM) cell deep learning (DL) model for postprocessing streamflow simulations which will herein be referred to as Self-activated and Internal Attention LSTM, or SAINA-LSTM. In this model, we incorporate an improved self-attention mechanism into the inner structure of the LSTM cell to increase focus on the more important time points, thereby enhancing the information flow of the cell. Performance of the SAINA-LSTM is then compared against that of the current National Weather Service's operational streamflow forecast ensemble postprocessor (EnsPost), a recently-developed multiscale alternative (MS-EnsPost), a robust machine learning algorithm (Gradient Boosting), and two other deep learning algorithms (LSTM and Gated Recurrent Unit (GRU)). Forecast performance in four basins in different climatological regimes of the United States are compared. Several deterministic evaluation metrics are examined for one to seven-day-ahead predictions of daily flows. SAINA-LSTM reduce the biases in simulations of low, medium, and high daily flows. The other two deep learning models also outperform EnsPost and MS-EnsPost in most cases. The results highlight the relatively poor performance of EnsPost, particularly in low flow conditions. Generally, the novel SAINA-LSTM model outperforms other models in low, medium, and high ranges of flow and for 1- to 7-day ahead forecasts in all three highly nonlinear and non-snow-driven study basins. In snowdriven basins, due to low nonlinearity, the three deep learning models are relatively comparable and significantly improved over statistical models. The results of the comparative evaluation demonstrate the capability of SAINA-LSTM to reduce the RMSE of daily-predicted flow by up to 20 percent compared to MS-EnsPost. The promising result shown here is a motivation for extending this research to also cover ensemble forecasting using the novel model developed in this work.","[Alizadeh, Babak; Zhang, Yu] Univ Texas Arlington, Dept Civil Engn, Arlington, TX 76019 USA; [Bafti, Alireza Ghaderi] Ferdowsi Univ Mashhad, Dept Civil Engn, Mashhad, Razavi Khorasan, Iran; [Kamangir, Hamid] Univ Calif Davis, Dept Agr & Environm Engn, Davis, CA 95616 USA; [Wright, Daniel B.] Univ Wisconsin, Dept Civil & Environm Engn, Madison, WI 53706 USA; [Franz, Kristie J.] Iowa State Univ, Dept Geol & Atmospher Sci, Ames, IA USA",,"Alizadeh, B (corresponding author), Univ Texas Arlington, Dept Civil Engn, Arlington, TX 76019 USA.",babak.alizadeh@uta.edu; ghaderibafti.alireza@mail.um.ac.ir; hkamangir@ucdavis.edu; yu.zhang@uta.edu; danielb.wright@wisc.edu; kfranz@iastate.edu,,,,,,86,4,4,17,17,ELSEVIER,AMSTERDAM,"RADARWEG 29, 1043 NX AMSTERDAM, NETHERLANDS",0022-1694,1879-2707,,J HYDROL,J.

Bubble fluxes of methane (CH4) from aquatic sediments to the atmosphere (ebullition) dominate freshwater greenhouse gas emissions, but it remains unknown how best to make robust near-term CH4 ebullition predictions using models. Near-term forecasting workflows have the potential to address several current challenges in predicting CH4 ebullition rates, including: development of models that can be applied across time horizons and ecosystems, identification of the timescales for which predictions can provide useful information, and quantification of uncertainty in predictions. To assess the capacity of near-term, iterative forecasting workflows to improve ebullition rate predictions, we developed and tested a near-term, iterative forecasting workflow of CH4 ebullition rates in a small eutrophic reservoir throughout one open-water period. The workflow included the repeated updating of a CH4 ebullition forecast model over time with newly-collected data via iterative model refitting. We compared the CH4 forecasts from our workflow to both alternative forecasts generated without iterative model refitting and a persistence null model. Our forecasts with iterative model refitting estimated CH4 ebullition rates up to 2 weeks into the future [RMSE at 1-week ahead = 0.53 and 0.48 log(e)(mg CH4 m(-2) d(-1)) at 2-week ahead horizons]. Forecasts with iterative model refitting outperformed forecasts without refitting and the persistence null model at both 1- and 2-week forecast horizons. Driver uncertainty and model process uncertainty contributed the most to total forecast uncertainty, suggesting that future workflow improvements should focus on improved mechanistic understanding of CH4 models and drivers. Altogether, our study suggests that iterative forecasting improves week-to-week CH4 ebullition predictions, provides insight into predictability of ebullition rates into the future, and identifies which sources of uncertainty are the most important contributors to the total uncertainty in CH4 ebullition predictions.","[McClure, Ryan P.; Thomas, R.

Two web-based flood forecasting tools (ECMWF-SPT and HIWAT-SPT) are therefore developed and deployed jointly by SERVIR-HKH and NASA-AST to provide early warning to Bangladesh, Bhutan, and Nepal. ECMWF-SPT provides ensemble forecast up to 15-day lead time, whereas HIWAT-SPT provides deterministic forecast up to 3-day lead time covering almost 100% of the rivers. Hydrological models in conjunction with forecast validation contribute not only to advancing the processes of a forecasting system, but also objectively assess the joint distribution of forecasts and observations in quantifying forecast accuracy. The validation of forecast products has emerged as a priority need to evaluate the worth of the predictive information in terms of quality and consistency. This paper describes the effort made in developing the hydrological forecast systems, the current state of the flood forecast services, and the performance of the forecast evaluation. Both tools are validated using a selection of appropriate metrics in measurement in both probabilistic and deterministic space. The numerical metrics are further complemented by graphical representations of scores and probabilities. It was found that the models had a good performance in capturing high flood events. The evaluation across multiple locations indicates that the model performance and forecast goodness are variable on spatiotemporal scale.

Synthetic forecasts can be generated to evaluate system performance with existing forecast products over historical periods when they were not available, or with different forecast products that do not yet exist. Synthetic forecast generation procedures should produce forecasts that are realistic and have the desired statistical properties. Two synthetic forecast generation techniques are proposed that create a time series of forecasts with (1)the desired mean, (2)the correct variance, and (3)the desired forecast precision. One uses a classical stochastic hydrology approach, and the other the generalized maintenance of variance extension (GMOVE) concept using historical hydrologic series as input. A critique is provided of several published synthetic forecast generation algorithms that produced unrealistic results. The GMOVE methodology is used in a stochastic optimization model of a single reservoir hydropower system. Using forecasts of varying precision, the example illustrates the ability of more precise forecasts to improve system operations.","[Lamontagne, J.

However, the pH level of other large bodies of waters, such as rivers, has largely been glanced over. Many rivers contain very sensitive underwater ecosystems, and as a result even small pH changes can largely impact the relative biodiversity. With the addition of increased carbon emissions and pollution, large bodies of water are absorbing more carbon and consequently the pH levels of rivers can rapidly change. This paper studies different deep learning approaches to analyze and forecast pH levels, which include a long short-term memory (LSTM), gated recurrent unit (GRU), recurrent neural network (RNN), and a Temporal Fusion Transformer (TFT) model to determine which algorithm provides the best pH predictive forecast. We demonstrate that the TFT outperforms other deep learning methods through various metrics. In addition, we clarify the importance of temperature as a feature in pH prediction. Lastly, we use the TFT to predict pH anomalies and discover the significance of the predicted data.

Thus, they require extensive and immediate research to limit the risks involved. Average temperatures in Europe in June-July 2019 were the hottest ever measured and attributed to climate change. The problem, however, of a thorough study of natural climate change is the lack of experimental data from the long past, where anthropogenic activity was then very limited. Today, this problem can be successfully resolved using, inter alia, biological indicators that have provided reliable environmental information for thousands of years in the past. The present study used high-resolution quantitative reconstruction data derived from biological records of Lake Silvaplana sediments covering the period 1181-1945. The purpose of this study was to determine whether a slight temperature change in the past could trigger current or future intense temperature change or changes. Modern analytical tools were used for this purpose, which eventually showed that temperature fluctuations were persistent. That is, they exhibit long memory with scaling behavior, which means that an increase (decrease) in temperature in the past was always followed by another increase (decrease) in the future with multiple amplitudes. Therefore, the increase in the frequency, intensity, and duration of extreme temperature events due to climate change will be more pronounced than expected. This will affect human well-being and mortality more than that estimated in today's modeling scenarios. The scaling property detected here can be used for more accurate monthly to decadal forecasting of extreme temperature events.

Based on a forecast and pre-defined trigger level, a Red Cross Red Crescent project distributed an unconditional cash grant of BDT 5000 (USD 60 equivalent) to 1039 poor households in highly vulnerable, flood-prone communities in the Brahmaputra river basin before an early flood peak. Systems that can deliver forecast-based cash grants are a potential adaptation strategy to deal with changes in extreme events linked to climate change. This paper presents the results of a mixed-methods, quasi-experimental study, based on a post-disaster household survey. The research assesses the effectiveness of the forecast-based cash distribution in helping beneficiaries to take preparatory early actions and reduce the negative impacts of the flood on their health, well-being, assets and livelihoods. The assessment shows that the cash grants contributed to improving households' access to food, a reduction in high-interest debt accrual of vulnerable households, and reduced psychosocial stress during and after the flood period, compared to a control group of similarly vulnerable and flood-affected communities that did not receive the forecast-based cash assistance. The intervention may also have prevented households from being forced to make destitution sales of valuable assets, as indicated by qualitative data collected in July, but we do not see these benefits sustained after a second flood peak in August 2017. There is a need for further research to assess the longer-term effects of forecast-based cash on the socio-economic development and well-being of the most vulnerable.","[Gros, Clemens; Bailey, Meghan; Hassan, Ahmadul; Jaime, Catalina; de Perez, Erin Coughlan] Red Cross Red Crescent Climate Ctr, Anna van Saksenlaan 50, NL-2593 HT The Hague, Netherlands; [Bailey, Meghan] Univ Oxford, Environm Change Inst, 34 Broad St, Oxford OX1 3BD, England; [Schwager, Saroja; de Perez, Erin Coughlan] Columbia Univ, Int Res Inst Climate & Soc, Earth Inst, Palisades, NY 10964 USA; [Zingg, Raymond; Uddin, Muhammad Mamtaz; Shahjahan, Mohammad; Islam, Hasibul] German Red Cross Bangladesh, 684-686 Red Crescent Sarak, Dhaka 1217, Bangladesh; [Lux, Stefanie] German Red Cross, Carstennstr 58, D-12205 Berlin, Germany; [de Perez, Erin Coughlan] Vrije Univ Amsterdam, Inst Environm Studies IVM, De Boelelaan 1087, NL-1081 HV Amsterdam, Netherlands",,"Gros, C (corresponding author), Rhinower Str 11, D-10437 Berlin, Germany.",gros@climatecentre.org,,"Jaime, Catalina/0000-0002-1053-8344; Gros, Clemens/0000-0001-6585-753X","German Federal Foreign Office, under the Action Plan of the Federal Foreign Office for humanitarian adaptation to climate change","This work was supported by the German Federal Foreign Office, under the Action Plan of the Federal Foreign Office for humanitarian adaptation to climate change.",,34,11,11,1,7,ELSEVIER,AMSTERDAM,"RADARWEG 29, 1043 NX AMSTERDAM, NETHERLANDS",2212-4209,,,INT J DISAST RISK RE,Int.

The dynamically downscaled climate fields were generated by running the Weather Research & Forecasting (WRF) model at 4-km horizontal resolution with boundary conditions derived from the Climate Forecast System Reanalysis. Six hydrologic models were developed using DHSVM for six mountainous tributary watersheds of the Jordan River basin at hourly time steps and 30-m spatial resolution. The size of the watersheds varies from 19 km(2) to 130 km(2). The models were calibrated for a 6-year period from water year (WY) 1999-2004, using the observed meteorological data from the nearby Snow Telemetry (SNOTEL) sites of the Natural Resources Conservation Services (NRCS). Calibration results showed a very good fit between simulated and observed streamflow with an average Nash-Sutcliffe Efficiency (NSE) greater than 0.77, and good to very good fits in terms of other statistical parameters like percent bias (PBIAS) and coefficient of determination (R-2). A 9-year period (WY 2001-2009) was selected as the historical baseline, and stream discharges for this period were simulated using dynamically downscaled climate fields as input to the calibrated hydrologic models. Historical baseline results showed a satisfactory fit of simulated and observed streamflow with an average NSE greater than 0.45 and a coefficient of determination above 0.50. Using volumetric analysis, it has been found that the total volume of water simulated using downscaled climate projections for the entire historical baseline period for all six watersheds is 4% less than the observed amount representing a very good estimation in terms of percent error volume (PEV). However, in the case of individual watersheds, analysis of total annual water volumes showed that estimated total annual water volumes were higher than the observed for Big Cottonwood, City Creek, Millcreek and lower than the observed total annual volume of water for Little Cottonwood, Red Butte Creek, and Parleys Littledell, demonstrating similar characteristics obtained from the calibration results. Seasonal analysis showed that the models can capture the flow volume observed for Big Cottonwood, City Creek and Red Butte Creek during the peak season, and the models can capture the flow volume observed for all the watershed satisfactorily except Big Cottonwood during the dry season. Study results indicated that the dynamically downscaled climate projections used in this study performed satisfactorily in terms of stream runoff, total flow volume, and seasonal flow analyses based on different statistical tests, and can satisfactorily capture flow patterns and flow volume for most of the watersheds considering the uncertainties associated with the study.","[Hasan, Mohammad M.; Burian, Steven J.; Barber, Michael E.] Univ Utah, Dept Civil & Environm Engn, Salt Lake City, UT 84112 USA; [Strong, Courtenay; Kochanski, Adam K.] Univ Utah, Atmospher Sci, Salt Lake City, UT 84112 USA",,"Hasan, MM (corresponding author), Univ Utah, Dept Civil & Environm Engn, Salt Lake City, UT 84112 USA.",mohammad.m.hasan@utah.edu; court.strong@utah.edu; adam.kochanski@utah.edu; burian@eng.utah.edu; michael.barber@utah.edu,"Kochanski, Adam/AAF-9987-2021","Kochanski, Adam/0000-0001-7820-2831; Strong, Courtenay/0000-0001-5866-4377; Hasan, Mohammad/0000-0001-8702-4811",U.S. EPAUnited States Environmental Protection Agency [83586601],The research was funded by U.S. EPA as mentioned in the under the agrrement no. 83586601.,,59,1,1,2,5,MDPI,BASEL,"ST ALBAN-ANLAGE 66, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND",,2073-4441,,WATER-SUI,Water,MAY,2020,12,5,,,,,,,1389,10.3390/w12051389,,,20,Environmental Sciences; Water Resources,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),Environmental Sciences & Ecology; Water Resources,MU8KA,WOS:000555915200168,,gold,,,2022-02-17

However, streamflow time series are highly complex and non-linear in nature; traditional or physical-based models may fail to capture the complexity and maintain the robustness of the datasets. Therefore, the present study aims to improve the forecasting accuracy and reduce the uncertainty in the datasets by using the data-driven approach such as artificial neural network (ANN) that can efficiently handle the non-linearity in the large and complex hydrological data. This study method includes two steps: i.e., first to develop the ANN models using different combinations of inputs such as rainfall, temperature, and streamflow lag by one or two and then to validate the developed models to forecast the streamflow by using a total of four performance evaluation indices such as correlation coefficient (R), root mean square error (RMSE), modified Nash-Sutcliff efficiency (MNSE), and modified index of agreement (MIA). The proposed method is demonstrated in Jakham reservoir located in Pratapgarh district, Rajasthan, India, for improving the accuracy of monthly streamflow forecasting over a 40-year period (1975-2015). We found that increasing the number of input parameters improves the accuracy of the model and enhance its performance. According to the results, the ANN models 5 and 6 (M-5 and M-6) showed significant variation in the performance evaluation criteria. This clearly indicates that ANN model with an input combination of lag one or two streamflow (i.e., model M-5 and M-6) is performed better when compared to a model that incorporates only monthly rainfall and monthly lag one or two rainfall as inputs. Overall, the application of ANN models M-5 and M-6 (with lag one and two streamflow as an input) can forecast monthly streamflow forecasting with better accuracy.","[Sharma, Priyanka; Sharma, Survey D.] Natl Inst Hydrol, Groundwater Hydrol Div, Roorkee 247667, Uttarakhand, India; [Madane, Dnyaneshwar] Punjab Agr Univ, Dept Soil & Water Engn, Ludhiana 141027, Punjab, India; [Bhakar, S.

The results revealed decreasing trends of the five indices, and varying length of the continuous longest skilful time slice from 3 days to 6 weeks depending on index, period and river location. In most cases, skilful abnormal terciles forecast occurred more often or with similar frequency to deterministic forecasts. It suggests that ensemble probability forecasting is a method with potential for extended-range river runoff forecast. Further, abnormal terciles are more skillful than normal terciles, and above normal are more skillful than below normal.

Developing an accurate forecasting model for a streamflow is highly essential for several applications in the field of water resources engineering. One of the main contributors for the modeling reliability is the optimization of the input variables to achieve an accurate forecasting model. The main step of modeling is the selection of the proper input combinations. Hence, developing an algorithm that can determine the optimal input combinations is crucial. This study introduces the Genetic algorithm (GA) for better input combination selection. Radial basis function neural network (RBFNN) is used for monthly streamflow time series forecasting due to its simplicity and effectiveness of integration with the selection algorithm. In this paper, the RBFNN was integrated with the Genetic algorithm (GA) for streamflow forecasting. The RBFNN-GA was applied to forecast streamflow at the High Aswan Dam on the Nile River. The results showed that the proposed model provided high accuracy. The GA algorithm can successfully determine effective input parameters in streamflow time series forecasting.","[Afan, Haitham Abdulmohsin; Salih, Sinan Q.] Duy Tan Univ, Inst Res & Dev, Da Nang 550000, Vietnam; [Allawi, Mohammed Falah] Minist Water Resources, State Commiss Dams & Reservoirs, Baghdad, Iraq; [El-Shafie, Amr] El Gazeera High Inst Engn Al Moqattam, Civil Engn Dept, Cairo, Egypt; [Yaseen, Zaher Mundher] Ton Duc Thang Univ, Fac Civil Engn, Sustainable Dev Civil Engn Res Grp, Ho Chi Minh City, Vietnam; [Ahmed, Ali Najah; Malek, Marlinda Abdul] Univ Tenaga Nas, Inst Energy Infrastruct IEI, Civil Engn Dept, Kuala, Lumpur, Malaysia; [Koting, Suhana Binti; Lai, Sai Hin; El-Shafie, Ahmed] Univ Malaya, Fac Engn, Dept Civil Engn, Kuala, Lumpur, Malaysia; [Mohtar, Wan Hanna Melini Wan] Univ Kebangsaan Malaysia, Fac Engn & Built Environm, Civil & Struct Engn Dept, Kuala, Lumpur, Malaysia; [Sefelnasr, Ahmed; Sherif, Mohsen] United Arab Emirate Univ, Natl Water Ctr, POB 15551, Al Ain, U Arab Emirates",,"Yaseen, ZM (corresponding author), Ton Duc Thang Univ, Fac Civil Engn, Sustainable Dev Civil Engn Res Grp, Ho Chi Minh City, Vietnam.",yaseen@tdtu.edu.vn,"El-Shafie, Ahmed/J-1799-2014; Salih, Sinan/F-6284-2019; Koting, Suhana/R-1738-2017; Afan, Haitham/ABF-2282-2021; Yaseen, Zaher Mundher/G-7029-2018; Lai, Sai Hin/H-3164-2018","El-Shafie, Ahmed/0000-0001-5018-8505; Salih, Sinan/0000-0003-0717-7506; Koting, Suhana/0000-0002-9568-1536; Afan, Haitham/0000-0002-4957-756X; Yaseen, Zaher Mundher/0000-0003-3647-7137; Lai, Sai Hin/0000-0002-7143-4805; Sefelnasr, Ahmed/0000-0002-0281-6455; Koting, Suhana/0000-0002-9487-1952; Allawi, mohammed/0000-0002-2725-687X","Bold 2025 grant by Innovation & Research Management Center (iRMC), Universiti Tenaga Nasional [RJO 10436494]; University of MalayaUniversiti Malaya [UMRG RP025A-18SUS]","The authors would like to appreciate the technical and financial support received from Bold 2025 grant coded RJO 10436494 by Innovation & Research Management Center (iRMC), Universiti Tenaga Nasional and from research grant coded UMRG RP025A-18SUS funded by the University of Malaya.",,48,24,24,5,10,NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP,LONDON,"MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",2045-2322,,,SCI REP-UK,Sci Rep,MAR 13,2020,10,1,,,,,,,4684,10.1038/s41598-020-61355-x,,,15,Multidisciplinary Sciences,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),Science & Technology - Other Topics,NF6XJ,WOS:000563438900012,32170078,"Green Published, gold",,,2022-02-17

However, accurate monthly streamflow forecasting is challenging due to its non-stationarity and uncertainty. Time series analysis methods have been proved to perform well in stationary time series forecasting, which can be derived from decomposition of the non-stationary sequence. As common decomposition methods in time domain, Empirical Mode Decomposition (EMD) and Ensemble Empirical Mode Decomposition (EEMD) are selected to decompose the components with different time-scale characteristics in the original hydrological time series in this study. The derived components are proved to be stationary by the stationarity test. Thus, Autoregressive Integrated Moving Average (ARIMA) model, a simple and effective time series analysis method, is used to forecast the components. A hybrid EMD/EEMD-ARIMA model is proposed in this study for long-term streamflow forecasting, which is applied to the upper stream of the Yellow River. The original daily streamflow time series of six years at the Tangnaihai station are firstly decomposed by EMD/EEMD into several stationary or simple non-stationary sub-series to explore detailed data information with different time scales. ARIMA models with appropriate parameters are then established for each subsequence to forecast the stream flow of the next year. Predicted ten-day and monthly stream flow is finally obtained combing the predictions of all the components. The EMD-ARIMA hybrid model performs best in forecasting high and moderate value of streamflow and fits best with the observation compared with EEMD-ARIMA and ARIMA models. The results not only verify the effectiveness of the proposed hybrid EMD/EEMD-ARIMA model in exploiting comprehensive information to improve the prediction but also indicate that the EMD-ARIMA model with end points disposal performs the best and can be used for long-term hydrological forecasting.","[Wang, Zhi-Yu; Li, Fang-Fang] China Agr Univ, Coll Water Resources & Civil Engn, Beijing 100083, Peoples R China; [Qiu, Jun] Tsinghua Univ, State Key Lab Hydrosci & Engn, Beijing 100084, Peoples R China",,"Li, FF (corresponding author), China Agr Univ, Coll Water Resources & Civil Engn, Beijing 100083, Peoples R China.; Qiu, J (corresponding author), Tsinghua Univ, State Key Lab Hydrosci & Engn, Beijing 100084, Peoples R China.",blueleaves1995@163.com; qiujun07@tsinghua.org.cn; liff@cau.edu.cn,,"Li, Fang-Fang/0000-0001-7007-5284; Qiu, Jun/0000-0003-2933-0727","National Key R&D Program of China [2017YFC0403600, 2017YFC0403602]","This research was founded by the National Key R&D Program of China, grant numbers 2017YFC0403600, 2017YFC0403602.",,53,14,16,5,28,MDPI,BASEL,"ST ALBAN-ANLAGE 66, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND",,2073-4441,,WATER-SUI,Water,JUL,2018,10,7,,,,,,,853,10.3390/w10070853,,,14,Environmental Sciences; Water Resources,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Environmental Sciences & Ecology; Water Resources,GR4LJ,WOS:000442579700036,,gold,,,2022-02-17

However, the distribution of the water resources is not aligned with demand, as most of the inflows to the reservoirs occur during the spring flood period. This means that carefully planned reservoir management is required to help redistribute water resources to ensure optimal production and accurate forecasts of the spring flood volume (SFV) is essential for this. The current operational SFV forecasts use a historical ensemble approach where the HBV model is forced with historical observations of precipitation and temperature. In this work we develop and test a multi-model prototype, building on previous work, and evaluate its ability to forecast the SFV in 84 sub-basins in northern Sweden. The hypothesis explored in this work is that a multi-model seasonal forecast system incorporating different modelling approaches is generally more skilful at forecasting the SFV in snow dominated regions than a forecast system that utilises only one approach. The testing is done using cross-validated hindcasts for the period 1981-2015 and the results are evaluated against both climatology and the current system to determine skill. Both the multi-model methods considered showed skill over the reference forecasts. The version that combined the historical modelling chain, dynamical modelling chain, and statistical modelling chain performed better than the other and was chosen for the prototype. The prototype was able to outperform the current operational system 57% of the time on average and reduce the error in the SFV by similar to 6% across all sub-basins and forecast dates.","[Foster, Kean; Olsson, Jonas] Swedish Meteorol & Hydrol Inst, Res & Dev Hydrol, S-60176 Norrkoping, Sweden; [Foster, Kean; Uvo, Cintia Bertacchi] Lund Univ, Dept Water Resources Engn, Box 118, S-22100 Lund, Sweden",,"Foster, K (corresponding author), Swedish Meteorol & Hydrol Inst, Res & Dev Hydrol, S-60176 Norrkoping, Sweden.; Foster, K (corresponding author), Lund Univ, Dept Water Resources Engn, Box 118, S-22100 Lund, Sweden.",kean.foster@smhi.se,,"Bertacchi Uvo, Cintia/0000-0002-8497-0295; Olsson, Jonas/0000-0001-5907-4061",Energiforsk AB; EUPO-RIAS (EUropean Provision Of Regional Impacts Assessments on Seasonal and decadal timescales) project - Seventh Framework Programme for Research and Technological Development (FP7) of the European Union [308291],"This work was supported by research projects funded by Energiforsk AB (formerly Elforsk AB) and the EUPO-RIAS (EUropean Provision Of Regional Impacts Assessments on Seasonal and decadal timescales) project funded by the Seventh Framework Programme for Research and Technological Development (FP7) of the European Union (grant agreement no. 308291).

Effective flash flood forecasting with useful lead times remains a challenge due to its high burstiness and short response time. Recently, machine learning has led to substantial changes across many areas of study. In hydrology, the advent of novel machine learning methods has started to encourage novel applications or substantially improve old ones. This study aims to establish a discharge forecasting model based on Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks for flash flood forecasting in mountainous catchments. The proposed LSTM flood forecasting (LSTM-FF) model is composed of T multivariate single-step LSTM networks and takes spatial and temporal dynamics information of observed and forecast rainfall and early discharge as inputs. The case study in Anhe revealed that the proposed models can effectively predict flash floods, especially the qualified rates (the ratio of the number of qualified events to the total number of flood events) of large flood events are above 94.7% at 1-5 h lead time and range from 84.2% to 89.5% at 6-10 h lead-time. For the large flood simulation, the small flood events can help the LSTM-FF model to explore a better rainfall-runoff relationship. The impact analysis of weights in the LSTM network structures shows that the discharge input plays a more obvious role in the 1-h LSTM network and the effect decreases with the lead-time. Meanwhile, in the adjacent lead-time, the LSTM networks explored a similar relationship between input and output. The study provides a new approach for flash flood forecasting and the highly accurate forecast contributes to prepare for and mitigate disasters.","[Song, Tianyu; Ding, Wei; Wu, Jian; Liu, Haixing; Zhou, Huicheng; Chu, Jinggang] Dalian Univ Technol, Sch Hydraul Engn, Dalian 116024, Peoples R China",,"Ding, W (corresponding author), Dalian Univ Technol, Sch Hydraul Engn, Dalian 116024, Peoples R China.",songtianyu@mail.dlut.edu.cn; weiding@dlut.edu.cn; wjdlut1992@163.com; hliu@dlut.edu.cn; hczhou@dlut.edu.cn; jgchu@dlut.edu.cn,,,"National Natural Science Foundation of ChinaNational Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC) [2018YFC0407705, 51709036, 91747102, 51879029]","This research was supported by the National Natural Science Foundation of China (Grant No. 2018YFC0407705, 51709036, 91747102, 51879029).",,25,7,7,15,25,MDPI,BASEL,"ST ALBAN-ANLAGE 66, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND",,2073-4441,,WATER-SUI,Water,JAN,2020,12,1,,,,,,,109,10.3390/w12010109,,,15,Environmental Sciences; Water Resources,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),Environmental Sciences & Ecology; Water Resources,KU6TM,WOS:000519847200109,,gold,,,2022-02-17

The hydrologic uncertainty processor (HUP) is a well-known Bayesian approach used to quantify hydrologic uncertainty based on observations and deterministic forecasts. This uncertainty quantification is model-specific; however, utilizing information from multiple hydrologic models should be advantageous and should lead to better probabilistic forecasts. Using seven, structurally different, conceptual models, this study first aims at evaluating the effects of implementing different hydrologic models on HUP performance. Second, using the concepts of the Bayesian Model Averaging (BMA) approach, a multimodel HUP-based Bayesian postprocessor (HUP-BMA) is proposed where the combination of posterior distributions derived from HUP with different hydrologic models are used to better quantify the hydrologic uncertainty. All postprocessing approaches are applied for medium-range daily streamflow forecasting (1-14 days ahead) in two watersheds located in Ontario, Canada. The results indicate that the HUP forecasts for short lead-times are negligibly affected by implementing different hydrologic models, while with increasing lead-time and flow magnitude, they significantly depend on the quality of the deterministic forecast. Moreover, the superiority of the proposed HUP-BMA method over HUP is demonstrated based on various verification metrics in both watersheds. Additionally, HUP-BMA outperformed the original BMA in quantifying hydrologic uncertainty for short lead-times. However, by increasing lead-time, considering the effects of initially observed flow on HUP-BMA formulation may not be beneficial. So, its modified version unconditioned on initial observations is preferred.","[Darbandsari, Pedram; Coulibaly, Paulin] McMaster Univ, Dept Civil Engn, Hamilton, ON, Canada; [Coulibaly, Paulin] McMaster Univ, Sch Earth Environm & Soc, Hamilton, ON, Canada; [Coulibaly, Paulin] United Nations Univ, Inst Water Environm & Hlth, Hamilton, ON, Canada",,"Darbandsari, P (corresponding author), McMaster Univ, Dept Civil Engn, Hamilton, ON, Canada.",darbandp@mcmaster.ca,"Darbandsari, Pedram/AAV-3921-2020","Darbandsari, Pedram/0000-0002-7139-8269",Natural Science and Engineering Research Council (NSERC) of CanadaNatural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada (NSERC); NSERC Canadian FloodNet [NETGP-451456],"The authors acknowledge that this work was supported by the Natural Science and Engineering Research Council (NSERC) of Canada, grant NSERC Canadian FloodNet (NETGP-451456).

These can be mitigated with preemptive action; however, currently available early warnings are limited to a few days' lead time. Extending warnings using subseasonal climate forecasts could open a window for more extensive preparedness activity. However, before these forecasts can be used, the basis of their skill and relevance for flood risk must be established. Here we demonstrate that subseasonal forecasts are particularly skillful over EEA. Forecasts can skillfully anticipate weekly upper-quintile rainfall within a season, at lead times of 2 weeks and beyond. We demonstrate the link between the Madden-Julian oscillation (MJO) and extreme rainfall events in the region, and confirm that leading forecast models accurately represent the EEA teleconnection to the MJO. The relevance of weekly rainfall totals for fluvial flood risk in the region is investigated using a long record of streamflow from the Nzoia River in western Kenya. Both heavy rainfall and high antecedent rainfall conditions are identified as key drivers of flood risk, with upper-quintile weekly rainfall shown to skillfully discriminate flood events. We additionally evaluate GloFAS global flood forecasts for the Nzoia basin. Though these are able to anticipate some flooding events with several weeks lead time, analysis suggests action based on these would result in a false alarm more than 50% of the time. Overall, these results build on the scientific evidence base that supports the use of subseasonal forecasts in EEA, and activities to advance their use are discussed.","[MacLeod, David A.] Univ Oxford, Atmospher Ocean & Planetary Phys, Oxford, England; [MacLeod, David A.] Univ Bristol, Sch Geog Sci, Bristol, Avon, England; [Dankers, Rutger] Wageningen Univ & Res, Wageningen Environm Res, Wageningen, Netherlands; [Dankers, Rutger; Graham, Richard] Met Off, Exeter, Devon, England; [Guigma, Kiswendsida; Jenkins, Luke; Todd, Martin C.; Kiptum, Augustine] Univ Sussex, Dept Geog, Brighton, E Sussex, England; [Kiptum, Augustine; Kilavi, Mary; Njogu, Andrew] Kenya Meteorol Dept, Nairobi, Kenya; [Mwangi, Emmah] Kenya Red Cross Soc, Nairobi, Kenya",,"MacLeod, DA (corresponding author), Univ Oxford, Atmospher Ocean & Planetary Phys, Oxford, England.; MacLeod, DA (corresponding author), Univ Bristol, Sch Geog Sci, Bristol, Avon, England.",david.macleod@bristol.ac.uk,,"Mwangi, Emmah/0000-0003-3838-0849; Jenkins, Luke/0000-0002-7206-7242","Science for Humanitarian Emergencies and Resilience (SHEAR) consortium project Towards Forecast-based Preparedness Action'' (ForPAc) [NE/P000673/1, NE/P000568/1, NE/P000428/1]; U.K. Natural Environment Research CouncilUK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Natural Environment Research Council (NERC); Economic and Social Research CouncilUK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Economic & Social Research Council (ESRC); U.K. Department for International Development; Peter Carpenter African Climate Scholarship programme; U.K. International Development Challenges Fund; SHEAR Doctoral Training Cohort; NERCUK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Natural Environment Research Council (NERC) [NE/P000428/1] Funding Source: UKRI","We thank KMD for provision of the Nzoia streamflow observations, and the S2S project for working toward improving access to subseasonal forecasts and making freely available the forecast data used here.

Among the available techniques, those based on machine learning models have sparked the interest of the scientific community in recent decades due to their good adaptability and forecasting accuracy, particularly when coupled with data pretreatment methods. These algorithms include artificial neural networks (ANNs) and support vector machines (SVMs). In the present study, a comparative analysis of a set of machine learning models, namely, an ANN and an SVM coupled with wavelet transform and data resampling with the bootstrap method, was performed. The analysis of these models was performed with daily streamflow time series for Sobradinho Reservoir, which is located in northeastern Brazil, corresponding to the period between 1931 and 2015. The results show that higher accuracy is achieved by the ANN than by the SVM. Furthermore, the best combination for predicting the streamflow into the Sobradinho Reservoir was the bootstrap, wavelet and neural network (BWNN) method. For a forecast 3 to 15 days ahead, this method yielded a mean square error (MSE) 15 to 25 times lower than that of the purely neural model (ANN), and the R-2 and mean absolute error (MAE) coefficients increased by more than 7 to 28% and 13 to 50%, respectively.

In this study, an improved streamflow forecasting approach using the optimal rain gauge network-based input to artificial neural network (ANN) models is proposed and demonstrated through a case study (the Middle Yarra River catchment in Victoria, Australia). First, the optimal rain gauge network is established based on the current rain gauge network in the catchment. Rainfall data from the optimal and current rain gauge networks together with streamflow observations are used as the input to train the ANN. Then, the best subset of significant input variables relating to streamflow at the catchment outlet is identified by the trained ANN. Finally, one-day-ahead streamflow forecasting is carried out using ANN models formulated based on the selected input variables for each rain gauge network. The results indicate that the optimal rain gauge networkbased input to ANN models gives the best streamflow forecasting results for the training, validation and testing phases in terms of various performance evaluation measures. Overall, the study concludes that the proposed approach is highly effective to achieve the enhanced streamflow forecasting and could be a viable option for streamflow forecasting in other catchments.","[Adhikary, Sajal Kumar; Muttil, Nitin] Victoria Univ, Coll Engn & Sci, Footscray Pk Campus,POB 14428, Melbourne, Vic 8001, Australia; [Adhikary, Sajal Kumar; Muttil, Nitin] Victoria Univ, Inst Sustainabil & Innovat, POB 14428, Melbourne, Vic 8001, Australia; [Yilmaz, Abdullah Gokhan] Univ Sharjah, Coll Engn, POB 27272, Sharjah, U Arab Emirates",,"Adhikary, SK (corresponding author), Victoria Univ, Coll Engn & Sci, Footscray Pk Campus,POB 14428, Melbourne, Vic 8001, Australia.; Adhikary, SK (corresponding author), Victoria Univ, Inst Sustainabil & Innovat, POB 14428, Melbourne, Vic 8001, Australia.",sajal.adhikary@live.vu.edu.au,"Adhikary, Sajal Kumar/I-7604-2019","Adhikary, Sajal Kumar/0000-0001-9899-8531; Yilmaz, Abdullah Gokhan/0000-0002-6813-836X","Australian GovernmentAustralian GovernmentCGIAR; Victoria University, Melbourne","The authors acknowledge the financial support from the Australian Government and Victoria University, Melbourne through an International Postgraduate Research Scholarship (IPRS) scheme to carry out this study.

It is a region undergoing rapid climate change, with a dramatic decrease in sea ice cover over recent decades. Surface advective pathways connect the transport of nutrients, freshwater, carbon and contaminants with their sources and sinks. Pathways of drifting material are deformed under velocity strain, due to atmosphere-ocean-ice coupling. Deformation is largest at fine space- and time-scales and is associated with a loss of potential predictability, analogous to weather often becoming unpredictable as synoptic-scale eddies interact and deform. However, neither satellite observations nor climate model projections resolve fine-scale ocean velocity structure. Here, we use a high-resolution ocean model hindcast and coarser satellite-derived ice velocities, to show: that ensemble-mean pathways within the Transpolar Drift during 2004-14 have large interannual variability and that both saddle-like flow structures and the presence of fine-scale velocity gradients are important for basin-wide connectivity and crossing time, pathway bifurcation, predictability and dispersion. The Transpolar Drift, which governs the transport of freshwater, nutrients, carbon and contaminants across the Arctic Ocean, varies interannually, and is affected by fine-scale flow structures and processes, according to high-resolution simulations and satellite data.","[Wilson, Chris] Natl Oceanog Ctr, Liverpool, Merseyside, England; [Aksenov, Yevgeny; Rynders, Stefanie; Kelly, Stephen J.; Coward, Andrew C.] Natl Oceanog Ctr, Southampton, Hants, England; [Krumpen, Thomas] Alfred Wegener Inst, Bremerhaven, Germany",,"Wilson, C (corresponding author), Natl Oceanog Ctr, Liverpool, Merseyside, England.",cwi@noc.ac.uk,"Rynders, Stefanie/AAB-5334-2022; Wilson, Chris/B-5742-2012; Krumpen, Thomas/D-5163-2011","Rynders, Stefanie/0000-0003-1334-4577; Wilson, Chris/0000-0003-0891-2912; Krumpen, Thomas/0000-0001-6234-8756","UKRI Natural Environment Research Council (NERC) [NE/R012865/1, NE/R012865/2, 03V01461]; German Federal Ministry of Education and Research (BMBF)Federal Ministry of Education & Research (BMBF) [NE/R012865/1, NE/R012865/2, 03V01461]; European Union's Horizon 2020 research and innovation programme [820989]; NERCUK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Natural Environment Research Council (NERC) [NE/T000546/1, NE/N018044/1, NE/R015953/1]; German Ministry for Education and Research (BMBF)Federal Ministry of Education & Research (BMBF) [03F0777A]","This work resulted from the Advective Pathways of nutrients and key Ecological substances in the Arctic (APEAR) project (NE/R012865/1, NE/R012865/2, #03V01461), part of the Changing Arctic Ocean programme, jointly funded by the UKRI Natural Envir-onment Research Council (NERC) and the German Federal Ministry of Education and Research (BMBF).

The wavelet transform is a very popular technique in the analysis of non-stationary time series and particularly effective for hydrological series. Currently, the application of intelligent hybrid systems in different fields has shown good performance and unparalleled efficiency. As such, in this work, we propose a hybrid neuro-fuzzy-wavelet model to modelling the rainfall-runoff transformation for forecasting daily flow rates in the Sebaou basin located in Tizi Ouzou region.

A solution is the use of satellite-observed rainfall and numerical weather prediction (NWP) for hydrological forecasting. We applied this method to the transboundary sparsely gauged Chenab River basin in Pakistan and India to reproduce the exceptionally high flood in 2014. We employed global NWPs by three weather centers to consider forecast uncertainty and downscaled them using the Weather Research and Forecasting (WRF) Model to prepare precipitation inputs. For hydrological simulations, we used a kinematic wave model, the Integrated Flood Analysis System (IFAS), for the upper-reach basin with high mountains and steep slopes, and we used a diffusive-wave rainfall-runoff-inundation (RRI) model for low altitudes and mild slopes. In our forecasting experiment, the precipitation by the global NWP was not able to predict flood peaks consistently. However, the downscaled rainfall by regional NWP showed good performance in predicting flood waves quantitatively, and a multimodel approach provided added value in issuing reliable warning as early as 6 days in advance. A confident streamflow forecasting near the border of the countries also led to reliable inundation forecasting by the RRI model in the lower-reach basin.","[Asghar, Malik Rizwan; Riaz, Muhammad] Pakistan Meteorol Dept, Flood Forecasting Div, Lahore, Pakistan; [Ushiyama, Tomoki; Miyamoto, Mamoru] Publ Works Res Inst, Int Ctr Water Hazard & Risk Management, Tsukuba, Ibaraki, Japan",,"Asghar, MR (corresponding author), Pakistan Meteorol Dept, Flood Forecasting Div, Lahore, Pakistan.",mrmkhokhar@gmail.com,,,Japan International Cooperation Agency (JICA); International Center for Water Hazard and Risk Management (ICHARM); IFAS,"This study was conducted under the support from the Japan International Cooperation Agency (JICA) and the International Center for Water Hazard and Risk Management (ICHARM).

Given that many water-related stakeholders are affected by seasonal hydrological variations, there is a need to manage such variations to their advantage through better understanding of the drivers that influence hydrological predictability. Here we analyze the seasonal forecasts of streamflow volumes across about 35,400 basins in Europe, which lie along a strong gradient in terms of climatology, scale, and hydrological regime. We then link the seasonal volumetric errors to various physiographic-hydroclimatic descriptors and meteorological biases in order to identify the key drivers controlling predictability. Streamflow volumes over Europe are well predicted, yet with some geographic and seasonal variability; however, the predictability deteriorates with increasing lead time particularly in the winter months. Nevertheless, we show that the forecast quality is well correlated to a set of descriptors, which vary depending on the initialization month. The forecast quality of seasonal streamflow volumes is strongly dependent on the basin's hydrological regime, with limited predictability in relatively flashy basins. On the contrary, snow and/or baseflow dominated regions with long recessions show high streamflow predictability. Finally, climatology and precipitation forecast biases are also related to streamflow predictability, highlighting the importance of developing robust bias adjustment methods. Overall, this investigation shows that the seasonal streamflow predictability can be clustered, and hence regionalized, based on a priori knowledge of local hydroclimatic conditions. Plain Language Summary Hydrological information for the months ahead is of great value to existing decision-making practices, particularly to those affected by the vagaries of the climate and who would benefit from better understanding and managing climate-related risks. Currently, there is limited knowledge of the factors controlling the quality of the seasonal streamflow forecasts. We analyze such forecasts over Europe and link their predictability to basin descriptors and meteorological biases. This allows the identification of the key drivers along a strong hydroclimatic gradient. The seasonal streamflow predictability varies geographically and seasonally with acceptable values for the first lead months. Predictability deteriorates with increasing lead time particularly in the winter months. The hydrological regime is strongly linked to the forecast quality, with quickly reacting basins showing low values. Basin climatology and precipitation forecast biases are also related to the predictability of streamflow.","[Pechlivanidis, I.

In a northern climate, where spring freshet constitutes the main inflow volume, seasonal forecasts can help to establish a yearly strategy. Long-term hydrological forecasts often rely on past observations of streamflow or meteorological data. Another alternative is to use ensemble meteorological forecasts produced by climate models. In this paper, those produced by the ECMWF (European Centre for Medium-Range Forecast) System 4 are examined and bias is characterized. Bias correction, through the linear scaling method, improves the performance of the raw ensemble meteorological forecasts in terms of continuous ranked probability score (CRPS). Then, three seasonal ensemble hydrological forecasting systems are compared: (1) the climatology of simulated streamflow, (2) the ensemble hydrological forecasts based on climatology (ESP) and (3) the hydrological forecasts based on bias-corrected ensemble meteorological forecasts from System 4 (corr-DSP). Simulated streamflow computed using observed meteorological data is used as benchmark. Accounting for initial conditions is valuable even for long-term forecasts. ESP and corr-DSP both outperform the climatology of simulated streamflow for lead times from 1 to 5 months depending on the season and watershed. Integrating information about future meteorological conditions also improves monthly volume forecasts. For the 1-month lead time, a gain exists for almost all watersheds during winter, summer and fall. However, volume forecasts performance for spring varies from one watershed to another. For most of them, the performance is close to the performance of ESP. For longer lead times, the CRPS skill score is mostly in favour of ESP, even if for many watersheds, ESP and corr-DSP have comparable skill. Corr-DSP appears quite reliable but, in some cases, under-dispersion or bias is observed. A more complex bias-correction method should be further investigated to remedy this weakness and take more advantage of the ensemble forecasts produced by the climate model. Overall, in this study, bias-corrected ensemble meteorological forecasts appear to be an interesting source of information for hydrological forecasting for lead times up to 1 month. They could also complement ESP for longer lead times.","[Bazile, Rachel; Boucher, Marie-Amelie; Leconte, Robert] Univ Sherbrooke, Dept Genie Civil, 2500 Blvd Univ, Sherbrooke, PQ J1R 2R2, Canada; [Perreault, Luc] Inst Rech Hydroquebec IREQ, 1800 Blvd Lionel Boulet, Varennes, PQ J3X 1S1, Canada",,"Bazile, R (corresponding author), Univ Sherbrooke, Dept Genie Civil, 2500 Blvd Univ, Sherbrooke, PQ J1R 2R2, Canada.",rachel.bazile@gadz.org,,"Boucher, Marie-Amelie/0000-0002-4246-2444",NSERCNatural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada (NSERC); Fonds de Recherche du Quebec Nature et Technologies,"The authors want to thank Kristian Forster and two anonymous reviewers for their useful comments on this article.

Since the water storage in Bajae dam is declining day-by-day and the people of Udupi district are under immense pressure due to scarcity of drinking water, alternatively depend on ground water. As the groundwater is being heavily used for drinking and agricultural purposes, there is a decline in its water table. Therefore, the groundwater resources must be identified and preserved for human survival. This research proposes a data driven approach for forecasting the groundwater level. The monthly variations in groundwater level and rainfall data in three observation wells located in Brahmavar, Kundapur and Plebri were investigated and the scenarios were examined for 2000-2013. The focus of this research work is to develop an ANN based groundwater level forecasting model and compare with hybrid ANN-PSO forecasting model.

Quantitative simulations of the effects of urbanization on karst flood events and forecasts of future evolution trends are difficult based on the current hydrological models. These models often require a large amount of data when used in karst areas due to the complex model structure and model parameters. To overcome the limitations of model applications, a physically based and fully distributed karst hydrological model, i.e., the improved Karst-Liuxihe (IKL) model, was proposed in this study to simulate and forecast karst flood events under the influence of urbanization. This IKL model was developed through the overall improvement of the Karst-Liuxihe (KL) model. The main additions were the improved runoff generation algorithm and the underground river confluence module. The karst flood simulation results of the IKL model were much better than those of the KL model: the average values of the Nash-Sutcliffe coefficient, correlation coefficient, and coefficient of the water balance increased by 23%, 23% and 26%, respectively, while the process relative error, flood peak flow relative error, and flood peak flow time error decreased by 21%, 22%, and 3 h, respectively, which confirmed that the improvements to the model were effective and feasible. Therefore, this paper used the IKL model to simulate karst flood events and annual runoff under the influence of urbanization based on 4 extreme land use scenarios. In addition, the model effectively forecasted the future runoff in 2030, 2040, and 2050. The results indicated that the critical proportion of urbanized area throughout the watershed area was 45%. When the urban proportion exceeded 45%, waterlogging could occur in the study area.","[Li, Ji; Yuan, Daoxian; Jiang, Yongjun; Zhang, Yuanzhu] Southwest Univ, Chongqing Key Lab Karst Environm, Sch Geog Sci, Chongqing 400715, Peoples R China; [Hong, Aihua; Deng, Shujin; Cao, Cong] Chongqing Geol Bur Geol & Minerals Explorat, Lab Chongqing Groundwater Resourse Utilizat & Env, Nanjiang Hydrogeol Team, Chongqing 401121, Peoples R China; [Yuan, Daoxian] Minist Land & Resources, Karst Dynam Lab, Guilin 541004, Peoples R China; [Liu, Jiao] Chongqing Hydrol & Water Resources Bur, Chongqing 401120, Peoples R China; [Chen, Yangbo] Sun Yat Sen Univ, Dept Water Resources & Environm, Guangzhou 510275, Peoples R China",,"Li, J; Zhang, YZ (corresponding author), Southwest Univ, Chongqing Key Lab Karst Environm, Sch Geog Sci, Chongqing 400715, Peoples R China.",445776649@qq.com; yuanzhuzhangswu@126.com,,"Jiang, Yongjun/0000-0002-9936-698X; Li, Ji/0000-0003-2267-0454","National Key Research and Development Program of China [2016YFC0502306]; Chongqing Municipal Science and Technology Commission Fellowship Fund [cstc2017jcyj-ysxX0004, cstc2018jcyj-yszx0013, cstc2019yszx-jcyjX0002]; China Postdoctoral Science FoundationChina Postdoctoral Science Foundation [2019M653316]; Chongqing Postdoctoral Science Foundation [cstc2019jcyj-bshX0017]; Open Project Program of the Laboratory of Chongqing groundwater resource utilization and environmental protection [2019KZ00774]; Open Project Program of the Chongqing Key Laboratory of the Karst Environment [Cqk201801]; Open Project Program of Guangxi Key Science and Technology Innovation Based on Karst Dynamics [202009]; Fundamental Research Funds for the Central UniversitiesFundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities [XDJK2019C017]","This study was supported by the National Key Research and Development Program of China (2016YFC0502306), the Chongqing Municipal Science and Technology Commission Fellowship Fund (cstc2017jcyj-ysxX0004, cstc2018jcyj-yszx0013, and cstc2019yszx-jcyjX0002), the China Postdoctoral Science Foundation (2019M653316), the Chongqing Postdoctoral Science Foundation (cstc2019jcyj-bshX0017), the Open Project Program of the Laboratory of Chongqing groundwater resource utilization and environmental protection (2019KZ00774), the Open Project Program of the Chongqing Key Laboratory of the Karst Environment (Cqk201801), the Open Project Program of Guangxi Key Science and Technology Innovation Based on Karst Dynamics (KDL and Guangxi 202009), and the Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities (XDJK2019C017).",,45,1,1,1,11,ELSEVIER,AMSTERDAM,"RADARWEG 29, 1043 NX AMSTERDAM, NETHERLANDS",0341-8162,1872-6887,,CATENA,Catena,FEB,2021,197,,,,,,,,104990,10.1016/j.catena.2020.104990,,,17,"Geosciences, Multidisciplinary; Soil Science; Water Resources",Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),Geology; Agriculture; Water Resources,PC7XE,WOS:000597208600033,,,,,2022-02-17

This study concerns the development of support vector machine (SVM) based model and its hybridization with particle swarm optimization (PSO) to forecast short term daily river flow at Upper Bertam Catchment located in Cameron Highland, Malaysia. Ten years duration of historical rainfall, antecedent river flow data and various meteorology parameters data from 2003 to 2012 are used in this study. Four SVM based models are proposed which are SVM1, SVM2, SVM-PSO1 and SVM-PSO2 to forecast 1 to 7 day ahead of river flow. SVM1 and SVM-PSO1 are the models with historical rainfall and antecedent river flow as its input, while SVM2 and SVM-PSO2 are the models with historical rainfall, antecedent river flow data and additional meteorological parameters as input. The performances of the proposed model are measured in term of RMSE and R-2. It is found that, SVM2 outperformed SVM1 and SVM-PSO2 outperformed SVM-PSO1 which meant the additional meteorology parameters used as input to the proposed models significantly affect the model performances. Hybrid models SVM-PSO1 and SVM-PSO2 yield higher performances as compared to SVM1 and SVM2. It is found that hybrid models are more effective in forecasting river flow at 1 to 7 day ahead at the study area.","[Zaini, N.; Malek, M. A.; Mardi, N.

Initially, the performance of the system is evaluated comparing observed and simulated precipitation and temperature anomalies in the irrigation periods of the years 2011-2017. Forecasts issued on April 1st (i.e., at the beginning of the irrigation period) are evaluated, considering two lead times (first and second trimester). Afterward, the seasonal forecasts are integrated into a complete meteo-hydrological system. Precipitation and temperature provided by the global model are ingested in the spatially distributed and physically based In-STRHyM (Intermediate Space-Time Resolution Hydrological Model) model, which analyzes the hydrological impact of the seasonal forecasts. Though the predicted precipitation and temperature anomalies are not highly correlated with observations, the integrated seasonal forecast for the hydrological variables provides significant correlations between observed and predicted anomalies, especially concerning mean discharge (>0.65).

However, precipitation forecasts are not the best indicator of hydrological extremes. Now, two different global scale hydro-meteorological approaches for predicting river flow extremes are available to support flood and drought preparedness. These approaches are statistical forecasts based on large-scale climate variability and teleconnections, and resource-intensive dynamical forecasts using coupled ocean-atmosphere general circulation models. Both have the potential to provide early warning information, and both are used to prepare for El Nino impacts, but which approach provides the most useful forecasts? This study uses river flow observations to assess and compare the ability of two recently-developed forecasts to predict high and low river flow during El Nino: statistical historical probabilities of ENSO-driven hydrological extremes, and the dynamical seasonal river flow outlook of the Global Flood Awareness System (GloFAS-seasonal). Our findings highlight regions of the globe where each forecast is (or is not) skilful compared to a forecast of climatology, and the advantages and disadvantages of each forecasting approach. We conclude that in regions where extreme river flow is predominantly driven by El Nino, or in regions where GloFAS-seasonal currently lacks skill, the historical probabilities generally provide a more useful forecast. In areas where other teleconnections also impact river flow, with the effect of strengthening, mitigating or even reversing the influence of El Nino, GloFAS-seasonal forecasts are typically more useful.","[Emerton, Rebecca E.; Stephens, Elisabeth M.; Cloke, Hannah L.] Univ Reading, Dept Geog & Environm Sci, Reading, Berks, England; [Emerton, Rebecca E.] European Ctr Medium Range Weather Forecasts, Reading, Berks, England; [Cloke, Hannah L.] Univ Reading, Dept Meteorol, Reading, Berks, England; [Cloke, Hannah L.] Uppsala Univ, Dept Earth Sci, Uppsala, Sweden",,"Emerton, RE (corresponding author), Univ Reading, Dept Geog & Environm Sci, Reading, Berks, England.; Emerton, RE (corresponding author), European Ctr Medium Range Weather Forecasts, Reading, Berks, England.",rebecca.emerton@reading.ac.uk,"Emerton, Rebecca/AAH-3813-2019","Emerton, Rebecca/0000-0003-0707-3993; Cloke, Hannah/0000-0002-1472-868X; Stephens, Elisabeth/0000-0002-5439-7563",Natural Environment Research Council (NERC) as part of the SCENARIO Doctoral Training PartnershipUK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Natural Environment Research Council (NERC) [NE/L002566/1]; NERCUK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Natural Environment Research Council (NERC); Department for International Development (DFID) under the Science for Humanitarian Emergencies and Resilience (SHEAR) research programme (projectFATHUM(Forecasts for AnTicipatory HUManitarian action) [NE/P000525/1]; Horizon 2020 IMPREX project [641811]; Environmental Forecasts team atECMWF; NERCUK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Natural Environment Research Council (NERC) [NE/P000525/1] Funding Source: UKRI,"The authors acknowledge financial support from the Natural Environment Research Council (NERC) as part of the SCENARIO Doctoral Training Partnership (grantNE/L002566/1), from NERCand the Department for International Development (DFID) under the Science for Humanitarian Emergencies and Resilience (SHEAR) research programme (projectFATHUM(Forecasts for AnTicipatory HUManitarian action), grant number NE/P000525/1), and from the Horizon 2020 IMPREX project (grant number 641811).

In this paper, a real-time framework for probabilistic flood forecasting using an Elman neural network is presented. Based on this framework, flood forecasting models with different lead times are developed and trained by a real-time recurrent learning algorithm for forecasting the inflow of the Xianghongdian reservoir of the Huai River in East China. The performances of these models are evaluated. The forecasting model having a 3 h lead time meets the precision requirements and is chosen as the deterministic flood forecasting model. Compared with the multilayer perceptron having a 3 h lead time, the relative error of flood volume is 5.28% less, and the coefficient of efficiency is 0.105 greater. We further analyze the error characteristics of the selected model and derive the discharge probability density function based on the heterogeneity of error distributions. The forecasted discharge intervals with different confidence levels, the expected values, and the median values are obtained. The results show that the average relative errors of flood volume and peak discharge obtained by the median value forecasting are -1.66% and 5.69% respectively, and the coefficient of efficiency is 0.784. The performance of the median value forecasting was slightly better than that of the deterministic forecasting, and considerably better than that of the expected value forecasting. This study demonstrates that the proposed model has high practicability and can provide decision support for flood control.","[Wan, Xinyu; Yang, Qingyan; Jiang, Peng; Zhong, Ping'an] Hohai Univ, Coll Hydrol & Water Resources, Nanjing 210098, Jiangsu, Peoples R China",,"Zhong, PA (corresponding author), Hohai Univ, Coll Hydrol & Water Resources, Nanjing 210098, Jiangsu, Peoples R China.",wanxinyujyd@163.com,,,National Key Research and Development Program of China [2016YFC0400909],This research was supported by the National Key Research and Development Program of China (No. 2016YFC0400909).,,60,12,12,3,28,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0920-4741,1573-1650,,WATER RESOUR MANAG,Water Resour.

Tests were made on two mesotrophic lakes in the English Lake District, which differ in depth and nutrient regime. Some forecasting success was shown for chlorophyll a, but not all forecasts were able to perform better than a persistence forecast. There was a general reduction in forecast skill with increasing forecasting period but forecasts for up to four or five days showed noticeably greater promise than those for longer periods. Associated forecasts of phytoplankton community structure were broadly consistent with observations but their translation to cyanobacteria forecasts was challenging owing to the interchangeability of simulated functional species.

Improved quantification of discharge extremes and associated uncertainties is needed to improve infrastructure design, and operational forecasting is needed to provide timely warnings. In this study, we use discharge observations, a hydrological model (Niger-HYPE) and extreme value analysis to estimate peak river flow statistics (e.g. the discharge magnitude with a 100-year return period) across the Niger River basin. To test the model's capacity of predicting peak flows, we compared 30-year maximum discharge and peak flow statistics derived from the model vs. derived from nine observation stations. The results indicate that the model simulates peak discharge reasonably well (on average + 20%). However, the peak flow statistics have a large uncertainty range, which ought to be considered in infrastructure design. We then applied the methodology to derive basin-wide maps of peak flow statistics and their associated uncertainty. The results indicate that the method is applicable across the hydrologically active part of the river basin, and that the uncertainty varies substantially depending on location. Subsequently, we used the most recent bias-corrected climate projections to analyze potential changes in peak flow statistics in a changed climate. The results are generally ambiguous, with consistent changes only in very few areas. To test the forecasting capacity, we ran Niger-HYPE with a combination of meteorological data sets for the 2008 high-flow season and compared with observations. The results indicate reasonable forecasting capacity (on average 17% deviation), but additional years should also be evaluated. We finish by presenting a strategy and pilot project which will develop an operational flood monitoring and forecasting system based in-situ data, earth observations, modelling, and extreme statistics. In this way we aim to build capacity to ultimately improve resilience toward floods, protecting lives and infrastructure in the region. (C) 2017 The Authors.

Here, we hindcasted how intertidal habitat loss and altered hydrodynamic regimes between 1955 and 2010 associated with geomorphological change to accommodate expansion in anthropogenic activities in the Western Scheldt altered spatial patterns and basin-wide estimates of ecosystem functioning. To this end we combined an empirically derived metabolic model for the effect of the common ragworm Hediste diversicolor on sediment biogeochemistry (measured as sediment oxygen uptake) with a hydrodynamic and population biomass distribution model. Our integrative modeling approach predicted an overall decrease by 304 tons in ragworm biomass between 1955 and 2010, accounting for a reduction by 28% in stimulated sediment oxygen uptake at the landscape scale. Local gains or losses in habitat suitability and ecosystem functioning were primarily driven by changes in maximal current velocities and inundation regimes resulting from deepening, dredging and disposal practices. By looking into the past, we have demonstrated how hydro- and morphodynamic changes affect soft-sediment ecology and highlight the applicability of the integrative framework to upscale anticipated population effects on ecosystem functioning.","[Fang, Xiaoyu; Moens, Tom; Van Colen, Carl] Univ Ghent, Dept Biol, Marine Biol Res Grp, Ghent, Belgium; [Fang, Xiaoyu] Univ Plymouth, Sch Biol & Marine Sci, Plymouth, Devon, England; [Cozzoli, Francesco] Res Inst Terr EcoSyst IRET, Natl Res Council Italy CNR, Rome, Italy; [Cozzoli, Francesco] Univ Salento, Dept Biol & Environm Sci & Technol, Lab Ecol, Lecce, Italy; [Smolders, Sven] Flemish Govt, Dept Mobil & Publ Works, Flanders Hydraul Res, Antwerp, Belgium; [Knights, Antony; Soetaert, Karline] NIOZ Royal Netherlands Inst Sea Res, Dept Estuarine & Delta Syst, Yerseke, Netherlands",,"Van Colen, C (corresponding author), Univ Ghent, Dept Biol, Marine Biol Res Grp, Ghent, Belgium.",carl.vancolen@ugent.be,,,MARES Ph.D. grant [2012-1720/001-001-EMJD]; EMBRC Belgium - FWO projectFWO [GOH3817N]; Special Research Fund (BOF) from Ghent University through GOA [01G02617],This work was funded by a MARES Ph.D. grant to XF (2012-1720/001-001-EMJD).

The probability of UHE and IHE are the major concern of decision-makers. This research proposes an analytical flood risk probability calculation framework for single-hazard event, UHE and IHE caused by uncertainties in flood forecasting and takes Dahuofang Reservoir, located in the Hunhe River basin, Northeast China, as a case study. In the framework, the risk is calculated by the integral of the joint probability density function (Pdf) of the risk sources over the hazard domain, which is the collection of the values of risk sources that cause hazards. The determination method of the hazard domain and the Pdf of risk sources and the procedure of risk analysis are elaborated. Results of single-hazard events show that the proposed methodology is of higher precision compared with the risk analysis method based on the law of total probability. Meanwhile, the flood risks of UHE and IHE are calculated for the reservoir operation under different levels of flood limit water level. The study provides a new method of flood risk analysis for flood control reservoir operation.","[Ning, Yawei; Ding, Wei; Liang, Guohua; He, Bin; Zhou, Huicheng] Dalian Univ Technol, Sch Hydraul Engn, Dalian, Peoples R China",,"Ding, W (corresponding author), Dalian Univ Technol, Sch Hydraul Engn, Dalian, Peoples R China.",weiding@dlut.edu.cn,,,"National Key Research and Development Program of China [2016YFC0400903]; National Natural Science Foundation of ChinaNational Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC) [52079015, 51779030]","National Key Research and Development Program of China (Grant No.2016YFC0400903) and the National Natural Science Foundation of China (Grant No. 52079015, No.51779030).",,40,0,0,13,15,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0920-4741,1573-1650,,WATER RESOUR MANAG,Water Resour.

To this end, methods to incorporate these observations into mathematical water models have also been developed. Besides, in recent years, the continued technological advances, in combination with the growing inclusion of citizens in participatory processes related to water resources management, have encouraged the increase of citizen science projects around the globe. In turn, this has stimulated the spread of low-cost sensors to allow citizens to participate in the collection of hydrological data in a more distributed way than the classic static physical sensors do. However, two main disadvantages of such crowdsourced data are the irregular availability and variable accuracy from sensor to sensor, which makes them challenging to use in hydrological modelling. This study aims to demonstrate that streamflow data, derived from crowdsourced water level observations, can improve flood prediction if integrated in hydrological models. Two different hydrological models, applied to four case studies, are considered. Realistic (albeit synthetic) time series are used to represent crowdsourced data in all case studies. In this study, it is found that the data accuracies have much more influence on the model results than the irregular frequencies of data availability at which the streamflow data are assimilated. This study demonstrates that data collected by citizens, characterized by being asynchronous and inaccurate, can still complement traditional networks formed by few accurate, static sensors and improve the accuracy of flood forecasts.","[Mazzoleni, Maurizio; Alfonso, Leonardo; Solomatine, Dimitri P.] UNESCO IHE, Inst Water Educ, Hydroinformat Chair Grp, Delft, Netherlands; [Verlaan, Martin] Deltares, Delft, Netherlands; [Monego, Martina; Norbiato, Daniele; Ferri, Miche] Alto Adriat Water Author, Venice, Italy; [Solomatine, Dimitri P.] Delft Univ Technol, Water Resources Sect, Delft, Netherlands",,"Mazzoleni, M (corresponding author), UNESCO IHE, Inst Water Educ, Hydroinformat Chair Grp, Delft, Netherlands.",m.mazzoleni@unesco-ihe.org,"Mazzoleni, Maurizio/O-2566-2016; Mazzoleni, Maurizio/G-3915-2018; Alfonso, Leonardo/B-5164-2011; Verlaan, Martin/K-5913-2012; Mazzoleni, Maurizio/F-5362-2018","Mazzoleni, Maurizio/0000-0002-0913-9370; Mazzoleni, Maurizio/0000-0002-0913-9370; Alfonso, Leonardo/0000-0002-8471-5876; Verlaan, Martin/0000-0001-7181-3955; Mazzoleni, Maurizio/0000-0002-0913-9370; Monego, Martina/0000-0001-6147-6043",EC FP7 project WeSenseIt: Citizen Observatory of Water [308429],"This research was partly funded in the framework of the EC FP7 project WeSenseIt: Citizen Observatory of Water, grant agreement no. 308429.

In this study, we revise our error model for generating Forecast Guided Stochastic Scenarios (FoGSS) to produce statistically re-liable long-range (12-month) forecasts for ephemeral rivers. FoGSS features an error model with four stages: data transformation, bias-correction, an autoregressive error model and the statistical distribution of residuals. We revise the fourth stage of FoGSS with a parameter estimation method that uses data censoring to account for zero values in both observations and forecasts. This allows FoGSS to produce statistically reliable ensemble forecasts in even highly ephemeral streams (with > 50% zero flows). We apply FoGSS to conventional ensemble hydrological prediction (ESP) forecasts for 50 Australian catchments, including 26 ephemeral rivers. We show that FoGSS improves the accuracy of ESP forecasts at short lead times, while at long lead times FoGSS forecasts transition to climatology-like forecasts. FoGSS forecasts are reliable in ensemble spread at individual lead times and for volumes aggregated over lead times, even in highly ephemeral rivers. FoGSS forecasts pave the way for operational long-range forecasts in ephemeral rivers, meeting a key need for improved water management.","[Bennett, James C.; Robertson, David E.; Bridgart, Robert] CSIRO Land & Water, Clayton, Vic, Australia; [Bennett, James C.; Michael, Kelvin] Univ Tasmania, Inst Marine & Antarctic Studies, Battery Point, Tas, Australia; [Wang, Q.

Firstly, ICEEMDAN is employed to decompose the streamflow time series into subcomponents that are further combined based on SE values. Afterward, GI is used to select the most appropriate features to decrease the computational burden and ameliorate the model's performance. Finally, Seq2Seq architecture based on the long short-term memory (LSTM) algorithm is utilized for predicting the multivariate hydro-meteorological data at three stations located in Turkey. Besides ISGS, the ICEEMDAN-SESeq2Seq, DWT-GI-Seq2Seq, DWT-Seq2Seq, and standalone Seq2Seq models are also constructed as counterpart comparison models. The simulation under different scenarios, several statistical metrics, and judicious plots; substantiate ISGS validity for streamflow forecasting.

Long short-term memory (LSTM) streamflow forecast model has received a lot of attention in recent years due to its powerful non-linear modeling ability. But probabilistic streamflow forecasting has rarely been addressed by the LSTM approach. In this study, a probabilistic Long Short-Term Memory network coupled with the Gaussian process (GP) is proposed to deal with the probabilistic daily streamflow forecasting. Moreover, considering that changing mean and variance over time exist in the daily streamflow time series, the heteroscedastic Gaussian process regression is adopted to produce a varying prediction interval. The proposed method encapsulates the inductive biases of the LSTM recurrent network and retains the non-parametric, probabilistic property of Gaussian processes. The performance of the proposed model is investigated by predicting the daily streamflow time series collected from the upper Yangtze River and its tributaries. Artificial neuron network, generalized linear model, heteroscedastic GP, and regular LSTM models are also developed for comparison. Results indicated that the performance of the proposed model is satisfying. It improves prediction accuracy as well as provides an adaptive prediction interval, which is of great significance for water resources management and planning.","[Zhu, Shuang; Luo, Xiangang; Xu, Zhanya] China Univ Geosci, Sch Geog & Informat Engn, Wuhan 430074, Peoples R China; [Yuan, Xiaohui] Univ North Texas, Dept Comp Sci & Engn, Denton, TX 76210 USA",,"Yuan, XH (corresponding author), Univ North Texas, Dept Comp Sci & Engn, Denton, TX 76210 USA.",xiaohui.yuan@unt.edu,"Yuan, Xiaohui/AAQ-1172-2020","Yuan, Xiaohui/0000-0001-6897-4563; Luo, Xiangang/0000-0001-9015-6460; Zhu, Shuang/0000-0001-7667-4093","National Natural Science Foundation of ChinaNational Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC) [51809242]; Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities, China University of Geosciences (Wuhan)Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities [G1323541875, G1323519436]","This work is supported by the National Natural Science Foundation of China (51809242), the Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities, China University of Geosciences (Wuhan) (G1323541875, G1323519436)",,52,20,20,11,36,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"ONE NEW YORK PLAZA, SUITE 4600, NEW YORK, NY, UNITED STATES",1436-3240,1436-3259,,STOCH ENV RES RISK A,Stoch.

The SPT can also provide boundary conditions for nested hydrologic models, e.g., higher-fidelity models in specific areas of interest. This presentation provides an overview of how ERDC researchers link SPT outputs to the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers Hydrologic Engineering Center River Analysis System (HEC-RAS) Version 5. The linkage allows ERDC to perform high fidelity, two-dimensional hydraulic forecasting at nearly any location in the world. The linkage relies upon the availability of high-resolution, global digital elevation models (DEMs). Bathymetry is estimated using general concepts related to hydraulic geometry. The authors demonstrate this approach with a case-study example in a data sparse region of the world.","[Gutenson, Joseph L.; Wahl, Mark D.; Geheran, Matthew P.; Farthing, Matthew W.; Follum, Michael L.] US Army Engineer Res & Dev Ctr, Hydrol Syst Branch, Coastal & Hydraul Lab, 3909 Halls Ferry Rd, Vicksburg, MS 39180 USA",,"Gutenson, JL (corresponding author), US Army Engineer Res & Dev Ctr, Hydrol Syst Branch, Coastal & Hydraul Lab, 3909 Halls Ferry Rd, Vicksburg, MS 39180 USA.",joseph.l.gutenson@erdc.dren.mil; mark.d.wahl@erdc.dren.mil; matthew.p.geheran@erdc.dren.mil; matthew.w.farthing@erdc.dren.mil; michael.l.follum@erdc.dren.mil,"Wahl, Mark D./C-6896-2012","Wahl, Mark D./0000-0002-2498-8602",,,,36,0,0,0,1,AMER SOC CIVIL ENGINEERS,NEW YORK,"UNITED ENGINEERING CENTER, 345 E 47TH ST, NEW YORK, NY 10017-2398 USA",,,978-0-7844-8139-4,,,,2018,,,,,,,250,262,,,,,13,"Engineering, Environmental; Engineering, Civil; Water Resources",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S),Engineering; Water Resources,BK4NT,WOS:000437020700024,,,,,2022-02-17

Accurate models are needed to plan and manage water resources in watersheds. Recently, support vector regression (SVR) shows the ability to handle the hydrological forecasting issues, but the accuracy of SVR depends on the appropriate choice of parameters and selection of proper inputs. A new meta-heuristic algorithm called grey wolf optimizer (GWO) is used in the current research in order to improve SVR accuracy in forecasting monthly streamflow. The proposed approach is compared with other evolutionary methods, particle swarm optimization, shuffled complex evolution, and multi-verse optimization, that are employed in tuning SVR parameters. Furthermore, the proposed methods were also combined with wavelet transform and tested using monthly streamflow data from two gauging stations, Ain Bedra and Fermatou, in Algeria. To assess the performance of the developed models, Nash-Sutcliffe efficiency (NSE), correlation coefficient, root mean squared error (RMSE), and mean absolute error (MAE) were used. The obtained results indicate that multi-linear regression provides appropriate input variables to SVR models. According to all of the performance measures used, hybrid models exhibit better performances, in monthly streamflow prediction, compared with single versions. For example, for the Ain Bedra station, the NSEcriterion and the correlation coefficient values increased considerably from 27.36% and 0.5405, for the single models, to 95.72% and 0.9786, for the hybrid models. A great decrease has also been obtained for the RMSE and MAE values, which decreased from 0.1562 m(3)/s and 0.1244 m(3)/s to 0.6433m(3)/s and 0.3047 m(3)/s. In addition, the new GWO algorithm outperformed the other algorithms in terms of both forecasting accuracy and convergence.","[Tikhamarine, Yazid; Souag-Gamane, Doudja] Univ Sci & Technol Houari Boumediene, Leghyd Lab, Algiers 32, Algeria; [Kisi, Ozgur] Ilia State Univ, Sch Technol, Tbilisi, Georgia",,"Souag-Gamane, D (corresponding author), Univ Sci & Technol Houari Boumediene, Leghyd Lab, Algiers 32, Algeria.",ytikhamarine@usthb.dz; souagd@yahoo.fr; ozgur.kisi@iliauni.edu.ge,"Doudja, SOUAG/ABF-7970-2021; Kisi, Ozgur/AAD-8932-2019","SOUAG-GAMANE, Doudja/0000-0003-1777-3029",,,,65,29,30,1,17,SPRINGER HEIDELBERG,HEIDELBERG,"TIERGARTENSTRASSE 17, D-69121 HEIDELBERG, GERMANY",1866-7511,1866-7538,,ARAB J GEOSCI,Arab.

Previous studies have shown the benefits of streamflow forecasts in improving optimized objective performance of reservoir operating rules. This study demonstrates a simple method for incorporating publicly available streamflow forecast information in operational planning for a water grid. Multiobjective optimization is used to find operating rules for a case study that are optimal for three management objectivesmaximizing minimum system storage, minimizing operational cost, and minimizing spills from reservoirsand for forecast inflow scenarios. These forecast-optimized rules are compared to those optimized using inflow scenarios from the historical distribution, representing operation in the absence of forecast information. The results across four seasonal (3-month) planning periods indicate that, on average, operating rules optimized using forecast streamflow information perform slightly better in terms of the management objectives than those optimized using historical inflow information. Using multiple scenarios of inflow that span the forecast distribution increases the robustness of the operating rules and reduces the risk of underperformance because of forecast inaccuracy. The results suggest that incorporating streamflow forecast information into multiobjective simulation-optimization has the potential to provide improvements in seasonal operating rules for a water grid.","[Ashbolt, Stephanie C.; Perera, B.

As the climate changes and urban populations grow, the number of people around the world at risk of surface water flooding is increasing. Although it may not be possible to prevent such flooding, reliable and timely flood forecasts can help improve preparedness and recovery. Unlike riverine and coastal flooding where forecasting methods are well established, surface water flood forecasting presents a unique challenge due to the high uncertainties around predicting the location, timing, and impact of what are typically localized events. Over the past 5 years, there has been rapid development of convection-permitting numerical weather prediction models, ensemble forecasting, and computational ability. It is now theoretically feasible to develop operational surface water forecasting systems. This paper identifies three approaches to surface water forecasting utilizing state-of-the-art meteorological forecasts: empirical-based scenarios, hydrological forecasts linked to presimulated impact scenarios, and real-time hydrodynamic simulation. Reviewing operational examples of each approach provides an opportunity to learn from international best practice to develop targeted, impact-based, surface water forecasts to support informed decision-making. Although the emergence of new meteorological and hydrological forecasting capabilities is promising, there remains a scientific limit to the predictability of convective rainfall. To overcome this challenge, we suggest that a rethink of the established role of flood forecasting is needed, alongside the development of interdisciplinary solutions for communicating uncertainty and making the best use of all available data to increase preparedness.

However, the sensitivity of the model outcome, regarding the hydrological and erosive response to climatic data derived with different methods, has not been fully understood. We carried out a hydrological simulation using (a) Climate Forecast System Reanalysis data set, which synthesises outputs of global climate models along with gauged weather information and has a global coverage, and (b) purely weather station-based gridded climate data provided by Indian Meteorological Department. A possible LULC scenario for the year 2020 was created using the combined Cellular Automata-Markov model. Application of both climate data sets resulted in a modest increase in the predicted streamflow and sediment yield as a response to the probable development scenario in 2020. However, the marked variations emerged in the location and monthly pattern of significant changes in the surface runoff and sediment yield in response to the likely LULC scenario for 2020 vis-a-vis 2010.","[Bhattacharyya, Suman; Sanyal, Joy] Presidency Univ, Dept Geog, 86-1 Coll St, Kolkata 700073, India",,"Sanyal, J (corresponding author), Presidency Univ, Dept Geog, 86-1 Coll St, Kolkata 700073, India.",joy.geog@presiuniv.ac.in,,"Sanyal, Joy/0000-0003-1849-1605; Bhattacharyya, Suman/0000-0002-7472-9377",,,,40,5,5,2,12,INDIAN ACAD SCIENCES,BANGALORE,"C V RAMAN AVENUE, SADASHIVANAGAR, P B #8005, BANGALORE 560 080, INDIA",2347-4327,0973-774X,,J EARTH SYST SCI,J.

The Great Lakes are a known hot-spot of meteotsunami activity and serve as an important region for investigation of essential hydrodynamic processes and model forecast requirements in meteotsunami-induced coastal flooding. For this work, we developed an advanced hydrodynamic model and evaluate key model attributes and dynamic processes, including: (1) coastal model grid resolution and wetting and drying process in low-lying zones, (2) coastal infrastructure, including breakwaters and associated submerging and overtopping processes, (3) annual/seasonal (ambient) water level change, and (4) wind wave-current coupling. Numerical experiments are designed to evaluate the importance of these attributes to meteotsunami modeling, including a representative storm scenario in the context of regional climate change in which a meteotsunami wave is generated under high ambient lake-level conditions with a preferable wind direction and speed for wind-wave growth. Results demonstrate that accurate representation of coastal topography and fully resolving associated hydrodynamic processes are critical to forecasting the realistic hazards associated with meteotsunami events. As most of existing coastal forecast systems generally do not resolve many of these features due to insufficient model grid resolution or lack of essential model attributes, this work shows that calibrating or assessing existing forecast models against coastal water level gauges alone may result in underestimating the meteotsunami hazard, particularly when gauging stations are sparse and located behind harbor breakwaters or inside estuaries, which represent dampened or otherwise unrepresentative pictures of meteotsunami intensity. This work is the first hydrodynamic modeling of meteotsunami-induced coastal flooding for the Great Lakes, and serves as a template to guide where resources may be most beneficial in forecast system development and implementation.","[Huang, Chenfu; Xue, Pengfei] Michigan Technol Univ, Dept Civil Environm & Geospatial Engn, Houghton, MI 49931 USA; [Xue, Pengfei] Michigan Technol Univ, Great Lakes Res Ctr, Houghton, MI 49931 USA; [Anderson, Eric] Natl Ocean & Atmospher Adm, Great Lakes Environm Res Lab, Ann Arbor, MI USA; [Liu, Yi] One Concern Inc, Menlo Pk, CA USA; [Ma, Gangfeng] Old Domin Univ, Dept Civil & Environm Engn, Norfolk, VA USA; [Mann, Greg] Natl Ocean & Atmospher Adm, Natl Weather Serv, Weather Forecast Off, White Lake, MI USA; [Xue, Pengfei] Argonne Natl Lab, Environm Sci Div, 9700 S Cass Ave, Argonne, IL 60439 USA; [Anderson, Eric] Colorado Sch Mines, Civil & Environm Engn, Golden, CO USA",,"Xue, PF (corresponding author), Michigan Technol Univ, Dept Civil Environm & Geospatial Engn, Houghton, MI 49931 USA.; Xue, PF (corresponding author), Michigan Technol Univ, Great Lakes Res Ctr, Houghton, MI 49931 USA.; Xue, PF (corresponding author), Argonne Natl Lab, Environm Sci Div, 9700 S Cass Ave, Argonne, IL 60439 USA.",pexue@mtu.edu,"Xue, Pengfei/P-4016-2014","Xue, Pengfei/0000-0002-5702-421X; Anderson, Eric/0000-0001-5342-8383","National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) Office of Oceanic and Atmospheric Research (OAR), through the University of Michigan Cooperative Institute for Great Lakes Research (CIGLR); NOAANational Oceanic Atmospheric Admin (NOAA) - USA [NA17OAR4320152]; COMPASS-GLM, a multiinstitutional project - U.S. Department of Energy, Office of Science, Office of Biological and Environmental Research, Earth and Environmental Systems Modeling programUnited States Department of Energy (DOE); Coastal Management Program, Water Resources Division, Michigan Department of Environment, Great Lakes, and Energy, under the National Coastal Zone Management Program through National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, U.S. Department of Commerce [NA18NOS4190162]","Funding for this project was provided by the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) Office of Oceanic and Atmospheric Research (OAR), through the University of Michigan Cooperative Institute for Great Lakes Research (CIGLR) cooperative agreement with NOAA (NA17OAR4320152).

In this paper, a multimodel approach was developed to further improve the accuracy and reliability of runoff forecasting fully considering of large-scale and local-scale climatic factors. First, with four large-scale atmospheric oscillations, sea surface temperature, precipitation, and temperature as the predictors, multiple linear regression (MLR), radial basis function neural network (RBFNN), and support vector regression (SVR) models were built. Next, a Bayesian model averaging (BMA)-based multimodel was developed using weighted MLR, RBFNN, and SVR models, and the performance of the BMA-based multimodel was compared to those of the MLR, RBFNN, and SVR models. Finally, the high-runoff performance of these four models was further analyzed to prove the effectiveness of each model. The BMA-based multimodel performed better than those of the other models, as well as high-runoff forecasting. The results also revealed that the performance of the forecasting models with multiple climatic factors were generally superior to that without climatic factors. The BMA-based multimodel with climatic factors not only provides a promising, reliable method for medium-and long-term runoff forecasting, but also facilitates uncertainty estimation under different confidence intervals.","[Chu, Haibo; Wei, Jiahua; Qiao, Zhen; Cao, Jiongwei] Qinghai Univ, State Key Lab Plateau Ecol & Agr, Xining 810016, Qinghai, Peoples R China; [Chu, Haibo; Wei, Jiahua; Li, Jiaye] Tsinghua Univ, State Key Lab Hydrosci & Engn, Beijing 100084, Peoples R China",,"Wei, JH (corresponding author), Qinghai Univ, State Key Lab Plateau Ecol & Agr, Xining 810016, Qinghai, Peoples R China.; Wei, JH (corresponding author), Tsinghua Univ, State Key Lab Hydrosci & Engn, Beijing 100084, Peoples R China.",haibochu0613@163.com; weijiahua@tsinghua.edu.cn; lijiaye16@mails.tsinghua.edu.cn; 584851559@qq.com; 498458263@qq.com,"Wei, Jiahua/AAA-8543-2019","Wei, Jiahua/0000-0003-1387-6442",Ministry of Science and Technology [2017YFC0403600]; National Natural Science Foundation of ChinaNational Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC) [51459003]; Chinese Ministry of Water Resources [201501028]; Science and Technology Projects State Grid Corporation of China [52283014000T]; China Postdoctoral Science FoundationChina Postdoctoral Science Foundation [41022207],"This work has been sponsored in part by the National Key Research and Development Project from the Ministry of Science and Technology during the Thirteenth Five-year Plan Period (2017YFC0403600), National Natural Science Foundation of China (51459003), the Chinese Ministry of Water Resources special funds for scientific research on public causes (Grant No. 201501028), the Science and Technology Projects State Grid Corporation of China (Grant No. 52283014000T), and the China Postdoctoral Science Foundation (No. 41022207).

This paper proposed a missing-aware-weighted hidden markov model (MWMO-HMM) combining expectation maximization algorithm (EM) with a weighted multi-order HMM to build groundwater quality prediction model with incomplete short-term observations. The proposed model was used to predict hydrogen ion concentration (PH) and chemical oxygen demand (COD) of groundwater in five representative cities. The Nash-Sutcliffe model efficiency coefficients of MWMO-HMM prediction results are respectively 61.51% and 98.06%. Compared with prediction results achieved by auto-regressive and moving average model (ARMA) and gray model (GM), the results show that MWMO-HMM is superior to ARMA and GM, ARMA and GM demonstrate an unstable performance of forecasting. In addition, missing value has a greater effect on ARMA than GM.

JPS is rolling out a program based upon the phased implementation of systems, which together form a new National Flood Forecasting and Warning System (NaFFWS) for its key river basins. The objective of the new NaFFWS is to develop and maintain an effective and efficient integrated flood forecasting and river monitoring system, with flood warning dissemination, using national telemetry network data, radar data and various rainfall forecasts; the NaFFWS is a tool designed to enable effective decision support by JPS. This paper presents the automation of flood forecasting that enables NaFFWS for three east coast catchments of Malaysia.

This study proposes strategies to effectively mitigate/reduce the concentration of cyanobacterial blooms based on probabilistic modeling. The model adopted in this study is a probabilistic forecasting model of cyanobacteria cell counts that uses two dominant variables contributing to cyanobacterial bloom in a river: water temperature (T) and water velocity (V). Both T and V can be manipulated by controlling the upstream flow in the river through altering reservoir operations, thereby changing water release downstream. We test and evaluate a variety of discharge scenarios in two river systems in South Korea. Our findings suggest that releasing cold dam water is quite effective in suppressing cyanobacterial bloom growth. We extend the analysis by also including the cost of each operation and conducting a cost-benefit analysis. Following this, we propose response scenarios for each river system by which optimal proactive actions can be taken according to river conditions.

This article evaluates forecasts relating to extreme weather events - extreme rainfall, tropical cyclones, river flooding and storm surge - in Myanmar and the Philippines to assess the feasibility of using such forecasts to develop early warning systems and responses. To make best use of limited extant data, a variety of methods (reliability diagrams, hit rates, false alarm ratios, correlations) are employed. We review the skill of the European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts (ECMWF) tropical cyclone forecasts and find that whilst errors in cyclone position are relatively small, forecasting intensity is more difficult. When a tropical cyclone has formed, the probabilities provided in the ECMWF track forecast are highly reliable and only slightly over-confident. A tropical cyclone activity product is relatively reliable for forecasts less than a week ahead for North Indian Ocean cyclones affecting Myanmar, but becomes very overconfident beyond this. Looking at flood forecasting models, a comparison of the Global Flood Awareness System (GloFAS, produced by the ECMWF and the European Commission as part of the Copernicus Emergency Management Services) with the Global Flood Forecasting Information System (GLOFFIS, produced by Deltares) demonstrates that both GloFAS and GLOFFIS have difficulty simulating 1 in 2 year return period flows or higher, although GloFAS performance is better than GLOFFIS. GloFAS reforecasts show significantly overconfident probabilities over Myanmar where discharge observations are available, whilst the lack of a GLOFFIS reforecast prevents evaluation of this forecast system directly. Evaluation of the ten-day operational storm surge forecast (the Global Storm Surge Information System, GLOSSIS) produced by Deltares was attempted but lack of any data prevented assessment. These findings present valuable insights into how well forecasts perform, which is crucial information for establishing effective humanitarian action mechanisms.","[MacLeod, David] Univ Oxford, Clarendon Lab, Atmospher Ocean & Phys Dept, Sherrington Rd, Oxford OX1 3PU, England; [Easton-Calabria, Evan] Univ Oxford, Dept Int Dev, 3 Mansfield Rd, Oxford OX1 3TB, England; [Perez, Erin Coughlan de; Jaime, Catalina] Red Cross Red Crescent Climate Ctr, Climate Sci Team, Anna Saksenlaan 50, NL-2593 HT The Hague, Netherlands",,"Easton-Calabria, E (corresponding author), Univ Oxford, Dept Int Dev, 3 Mansfield Rd, Oxford OX1 3TB, England.",david.macleod@bristol.ac.uk; Evan.easton-calabria@qeh.ox.ac.uk; Coughlan@climatecentre.org; jaime@climatecentre.org,,"Jaime, Catalina/0000-0002-1053-8344",,,,23,1,1,4,4,ELSEVIER,AMSTERDAM,"RADARWEG 29, 1043 NX AMSTERDAM, NETHERLANDS",2212-0947,,,WEATHER CLIM EXTREME,Weather Clim.

This can be due to the complexity involved in making more advanced formal assumptions about the nature of the model and measurement errors. Recent advances in the definition of rating curve uncertainty allow estimating a flow measurement error that includes both aleatory and epistemic uncertainties more explicitly and rigorously than in the current practice. The aim of this study is to understand the effect such a more rigorous definition of the flow measurement error has on real-time data assimilation and forecasting. This study, therefore, develops a comprehensive probabilistic framework that considers the uncertainty in model forcing data, model structure, and flow observations. Three common data assimilation techniques are evaluated: (1) Autoregressive error correction, (2) Ensemble Kalman Filter, and (3) Regularized Particle Filter, and applied to two locations in the flood-prone Oria catchment in the Basque Country, northern Spain. The results show that, although there is a better match between the uncertain forecasted and uncertain true flows, there is a low sensitivity for the threshold exceedances used to issue flood warnings. This suggests that a standard flow measurement error model, with a spread set to a fixed flow fraction, represents a reasonable trade-off between complexity and realism. Standard models are therefore recommended for operational flood forecasting for sites with well-defined stage-discharge curves that are based on a large range of flow observations. Plain Language Summary Flood early warning systems are an efficient and affordable tool to mitigate flood risks without altering the fluvial ecosystems. Their benefits rely, however, on an accurate prediction of the timing and magnitude of flood peaks. As in any mathematical simulation of natural processes, flood forecasts must deal with several sources of uncertainty. To reduce them, a standard practice is to compare the outputs of the hydrological model with real-time observations in order to understand and correct the registered deviations. In operational systems, streamflow measurements are thought to be error-free or having a typical, although arbitrary, error. The impact of this choice has been little investigated. Recent advances in the characterization of rating curve uncertainty allow now a more objective definition of the streamflow measurement error, whose consideration in flood forecasting might improve the quality of the flood warnings. While this research has proven this, it has also shown that, when the deterministic rating curve is based on a broad range of flow gaugings, its use while correcting the hydrological model can still lead to good forecasts. Hence, the loss of accuracy may not be significant enough to justify an increase in complexity and computational costs.","[Ocio, David; Le Vine, Nataliya; Buytaert, Wouter] Imperial Coll London, Dept Civil & Environm Engn, London, England; [Westerberg, Ida] IVL Swedish Environm Res Inst, Stockholm, Sweden; [Pappenberger, Florian] European Ctr Medium Range Weather Forecasts, Reading, Berks, England; [Pappenberger, Florian] Univ Bristol, Sch Geog Sci, Bristol, Avon, England",,"Ocio, D (corresponding author), Imperial Coll London, Dept Civil & Environm Engn, London, England.",david.ocio-moreno15@imperial.ac.uk,"Pappenberger, Florian/A-2839-2009; Buytaert, Wouter/D-9912-2011; Westerberg, Ida/H-9023-2013; Le Vine, Nataliya/M-6788-2015","Pappenberger, Florian/0000-0003-1766-2898; Buytaert, Wouter/0000-0001-6994-4454; Westerberg, Ida/0000-0002-9382-0782; Le Vine, Nataliya/0000-0002-1492-447X",Swedish Research Council FormasSwedish Research CouncilSwedish Research Council Formas [942-2015-321]; NERCUK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Natural Environment Research Council (NERC) [NE/J016578/1] Funding Source: UKRI; Natural Environment Research CouncilUK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Natural Environment Research Council (NERC) [NE/J016578/1] Funding Source: researchfish,"We are grateful to the Basque Water Agency for the data required in this study, as well as to Jerome Le Coz for kindly providing us with the last version of BaRatin.

The new model is tested in the upstream river reach of Three Gorges Dam (TGD) on the Yangtze River, China. Stage observations at seven hydrological stations are used simultaneously to adjust the Manning's roughness coefficients and to update discharges and stages along the river reach to attain reliable probabilistic flood forecasting. The synthetic experiments are applied to demonstrate the new model's correction and forecasting performances. The real-world experiments show that the new model can make accurate flood forecasting as well as derive reliable intervals for different confidence levels. The new probabilistic flood forecasting model not only outperforms the existing deterministic channel flood-forecasting models in accuracy, but also provides a more robust tool with which to incorporate uncertainty into flood-control efforts.

The approach presented here goes one step further by proposing an integrated forecasting chain for the direct assessment of flash flood possible impacts on inhabited areas (number of buildings at risk in the presented case studies). The proposed approach includes, in addition to a distributed rainfall-runoff model, an automatic hydraulic method suited for the computation of flood extent maps on a dense river network and over large territories. The resulting catalogue of flood extent maps is then combined with land use data to build a flood impact curve for each considered river reach, i.e. the number of inundated buildings versus discharge. These curves are finally used to compute estimated impacts based on forecasted discharges. The approach has been extensively tested in the regions of Ales and Draguignan, located in the south of France, where well-documented major flash floods recently occurred. The article presents two types of validation results. First, the automatically computed flood extent maps and corresponding water levels are tested against rating curves at available river gauging stations as well as against local reference or observed flood extent maps.

Climate-induced changes in visitor demand, specifically climate-related coping behaviors (e.g., seeking safer recreation sites, changing trip timing, using weather forecasts to plan trips), are influenced by multiple factors such as season of visit, specific visitor attributes, and general climate change beliefs and concern. Understanding the relationships between visitor characteristics and coping behaviors within the context of a changing climate will help recreation managers and tourism providers anticipate shifts in demand and adapt strategically. In this study, we present results from a series of binary logistic regression models of summer and winter visitor survey data to examine climate-related coping behaviors within a regional nature-based tourism area (the North Shore region of Lake Superior in Minnesota). Findings reveal that winter recreationists, younger visitors, and visitors who are concerned about climate change, are most inclined to use behavioral coping in response to changing climate and environmental conditions. Specifically, we found that winter season recreationists are much more likely to report having experienced a past climate-related impact, and that weather information, alternative gear, and flexibility in timing their trips are important in overcoming these constraints. Further, younger visitors were more likely to use informational (weather forecast) coping, site substitution, and activity substitution to respond to climate-related impacts. This study expands upon climate-related recreation and tourism research by documenting how recreationists' informational, spatial, and temporal coping behaviors vary across visitor characteristics. Further research is needed to determine if the behavioral coping preferences and patterns found in this study emerge across diverse contexts. However, our findings here can help managers begin to strategically plan and collaborate to maintain destination-level attractiveness to visitors despite changing environmental conditions. Management implications: Understanding how visitors respond to environmental changes is important in sustaining 'weather-resistant' visitor flows. In anticipation of on-site disruptions and future demand shifts, regional partnerships within nature-based destinations may mitigate reductions in visitor demand and accommodate shifting patterns in visitor flows. For example, recreation managers and tourism providers could identify and jointly market alternative recreation opportunities when conditions are not conducive to participating in desired activities, as well as develop a networked approach for communicating weather and site safety information.","[McCreary, Allie] Western Kentucky Univ, Sch Kinesiol Recreat & Sport, Bowling Green, KY 42101 USA; [Seekamp, Erin; Larson, Lincoln L.] North Carolina State Univ, Dept Pk Recreat & Tourism Management, Biltmore Hall,Campus Box 8004, Raleigh, NC 27695 USA; [Smith, Jordan W.] Utah State Univ, Inst Outdoor Recreat & Tourism, Environm & Soc, Logan, UT 84322 USA; [Davenport, Mae A.] Univ Minnesota, Dept Forest Resources, Minneapolis, MN 55455 USA",,"Seekamp, E (corresponding author), North Carolina State Univ, Dept Pk Recreat & Tourism Management, Biltmore Hall,Campus Box 8004, Raleigh, NC 27695 USA.",erin_seekamp@ncsu.edu,"Smith, Jordan/AAR-9126-2021","McCreary, Allie/0000-0003-2332-3999; Larson, Lincoln/0000-0001-9591-1269; Seekamp, Erin/0000-0001-5082-1921","Minnesota Sea Grant, National Sea Grant College Program, National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, U.S. Department of Commerce [NA14OAR4170080]","This work was prepared by E.

OpenForecast v2 delivers 7 day-ahead streamflow forecasts for 843 gauges across Russia. The verification study has been carried out using 244 gauges for which operational streamflow data were openly available and quality-controlled for the entire verification period (14 March-6 July 2020). The results showed that the developed system provides reliable and skillful runoff forecasts for up to one week. The benchmark testing against climatology and persistence forecasts showed that the system provides skillful predictions for most analyzed basins.

The study employs the state-of-the-art National Water Model (NWM) and compares the effects of initial soil moisture condition with those of seasonal climate anomalies on streamflow and soil moisture forecast skills. We have designed and implemented seasonal streamflow forecast ensemble experiments following the methodology suggested by Dirmeyer et al. The study also compares the soil moisture variability in the NWM with in situ measurements and remote sensing data from the Soil Moisture Active and Passive (SMAP) satellite. The NWM skillfully simulates the observed streamflow in the ACT basin. The soil moisture variability is 46% smaller in the NWM compared with the SMAP data, mainly due to a weaker amplitude of the seasonal cycle. This study finds that initial soil moisture condition is a major source of predictability for the seasonal streamflow forecast. The contribution of the initial soil moisture condition is comparable or even higher than that of seasonal climate anomaly effects in dry seasons. In the boreal summer season, the initial soil moisture condition contributes to 65% and 48% improvements in the seasonal streamflow and soil moisture forecast skills, respectively. This study attributes a greater improvement in the streamflow forecast skill to the lag effects between the soil moisture and streamflow anomalies.

However, the spatiotemporal trends of these hydroclimatic variables remain uncertain under the changing climate at the regional scale. Therefore, we analyzed hydroclimatic variable trends in the north and northeast regions of Bangladesh for 38 years (1980-2017) using a set of parametric and non-parametric techniques and forecasted by the Autoregressive Integrated Moving Average (ARIMA) model. Based on detrended fluctuation analysis, long-range associations of the hydroclimatic variables suggested that these variables will retain their current trend line in the forthcoming period. Annual temperature and river water discharge exhibited an increasing linear trend of 0.014 degrees C and 0.61 m(3) s(-1) per year, while annual rainfall demonstrated a declining linear trend of - 0.87 mm and resultant in an annual water level decrease of - 0.03 m per year. Seasonal maximum trends were observed for rainfall in the winter (- 2.25 mm), the temperature in monsoon (0.03 degrees C) and water discharge in post-monsoon (10.7 m(3) s(-1)), and water level in post-monsoon (- 0.54 m) per year. The ARIMA model forecasted that the temperature would be increased by 0.14 degrees C/decade and water discharge will be 8.75 m(3) s(-1)/decade, while rainfall and water level will be decreased by 90 mm/decade and 1.24 m/decade respectively for the period 2018-2027.

In this study, we evaluate the potential skill of ensemble streamflow forecasts for flood prediction in South America (SA), with a closer look on some of the large basins of the continent. Medium-range precipitation forecasts from the ECMWF Ensemble Prediction System were used to force a continental-scale, fully coupled hydrologic-hydrodynamic model to produce streamflow forecasts up to 15 days in advance. Forecasts were evaluated over a 4-year period against a reference simulation, derived from the hydrological model forced with a gridded precipitation dataset that merges data from multiple sources (MSWEP). To provide a benchmark for assessing the potential skill, forecasts based on the Ensemble Streamflow Prediction (ESP) technique were produced by running the hydrological model with precipitation data resampled from past MSWEP observations. Overall, ECMWF-based forecasts were skillful mainly at the eastern and southeastern regions of the continent (e.g., Sao Francisco, Parnaiba, Upper Parana, Tocantins-Araguaia and Uruguay basins), showing little or no added skill in large rivers draining the Andes such as the Magdalena, Orinoco, Madeira (Amazon) and right-bank tributaries of the Paraguay. In the latter basins, ECMWF-based forecasts largely overestimated the exceedance probabilities of critical thresholds due to a positive bias in the predicted precipitation (in relation to MSWEP), visible mostly during the wet season. In addition, forecasts were found to perform better than ESP in terms of both overall quality and discrimination skill at regions characterized by a warm temperate, fully-humid climate. A direct relation between forecast skill and basin size was not always valid, since the former can vary geographically along tributaries. Limitations and future developments needed for continental-scale hydrological forecasting in SA are also discussed.","[Siqueira, Vinicius Alencar; Fan, Fernando Mainardi; Dias de Paiva, Rodrigo Cauduro; Collischonn, Walter] Univ Fed Rio Grande do Sul, Inst Pesquisas Hidraul IPH, Porto Alegre, RS, Brazil; [Ramos, Maria-Helena] Univ Paris Saclay, UR HYCAR, INRAE, Antony, France",,"Siqueira, VA (corresponding author), Univ Fed Rio Grande do Sul UFRGS, Inst Pesquisas Hidraul IPH, Av Bento Goncalves 9500, BR-90050260 Porto Alegre, RS, Brazil.",vinisiquera@gmail.com; fernando.fan@ufrgs.br; rodrigocdpaiva@gmail.com; maria-helena.ramos@inrae.fr; collischonn@iph.ufrgs.br,"Fan, Fernando Mainardi/I-2421-2019; Collischonn, Walter/ABA-7378-2020; Siqueira, Vinícius A/K-1499-2017","Fan, Fernando Mainardi/0000-0003-0371-7851; Siqueira, Vinícius A/0000-0002-1628-7101; Ramos, Maria-Helena/0000-0003-1133-4164","Brazilian National Council for Scientific Research (CNPq)Conselho Nacional de Desenvolvimento Cientifico e Tecnologico (CNPQ) [141450/2015-0, 422422/2016-9]",The authors would like to acknowledge the Brazilian National Council for Scientific Research (CNPq) for funding this research under the grant numbers 141450/2015-0 and 422422/2016-9 (Project: South America Flood Awareness System -SAFAS); the European Center of Medium-Range Weather Forecasting (ECMWF) for making available the ensemble precipitation forecasts used in this study; Princeton University for the MSWEP precipitation data; and the two anonymous reviewers for their useful contributions which helped us to improve the manuscript.,,135,3,3,4,11,ELSEVIER,AMSTERDAM,"RADARWEG 29, 1043 NX AMSTERDAM, NETHERLANDS",0022-1694,1879-2707,,J HYDROL,J.

If floods could be accurately forecasted in advance, then their negative impacts could be greatly minimized. It is widely recognized that quantification and reduction of uncertainty associated with the hydrologic forecast is of great importance for flood estimation and rational decision making. Bayesian forecasting system (BFS) offers an ideal theoretic framework for uncertainty quantification that can be developed for probabilistic flood forecasting via any deterministic hydrologic model. It provides suitable theoretical structure, empirically validated models and reasonable analytic numerical computation method, and can be developed into various Bayesian forecasting approaches. This paper presents a comprehensive review on Bayesian forecasting approaches applied in flood forecasting from 1999 till now. The review starts with an overview of fundamentals of BFS and recent advances in BFS, followed with BFS application in river stage forecasting and real-time flood forecasting, then move to a critical analysis by evaluating advantages and limitations of Bayesian forecasting methods and other predictive uncertainty assessment approaches in flood forecasting, and finally discusses the future research direction in Bayesian flood forecasting. Results show that the Bayesian flood forecasting approach is an effective and advanced way for flood estimation, it considers all sources of uncertainties and produces a predictive distribution of the river stage, river discharge or runoff, thus gives more accurate and reliable flood forecasts. Some emerging Bayesian forecasting methods (e.g. ensemble Bayesian forecasting system, Bayesian multi-model combination) were shown to overcome limitations of single model or fixed model weight and effectively reduce predictive uncertainty. In recent years, various Bayesian flood forecasting approaches have been developed and widely applied, but there is still room for improvements. Future research in the context of Bayesian flood forecasting should be on assimilation of various sources of newly available information and improvement of predictive performance assessment methods.

In this study, a locally weighted learning (LWL) algorithm is combined with the Additive Regression (AR), Bagging (BG), Dagging (DG), Random Subspace (RS), and Rotation Forest (RF) ensemble techniques for the streamflow forecasting in the Jhelum Catchment, Pakistan. To build the models, we grouped the initial parameters into four different scenarios (M1-M4) of input data with a five-fold cross-validation (I-V) approach. To evaluate the accuracy of the developed ensemble models, previous lagged values of streamflow were used as inputs whereas the cross-validation technique and periodicity input were used to examine prediction accuracy on the basis of root correlation coefficient (R), root mean squared error (RMSE), mean absolute error (MAE), relative absolute error (RAE), and root relative squared error (RRSE). The results showed that the incorporation of periodicity (i.e., MN) as an additional input variable considerably improved both the training performance and predictive performance of the models. A comparison between the results obtained from the input combinations III and IV revealed a significant performance improvement. The cross-validation revealed that the dataset M3 provided more accurate results compared to the other datasets. While all the ensemble models successfully outperformed the standalone LWL model, the ensemble LWL-AR model was identified as the best model. Our study demonstrated that the ensemble modeling approach is a robust and promising alternative to the single forecasting of streamflow that should be further investigated with different datasets from other regions around the world.","[Adnan, Rana Muhammad] Hohai Univ, State Key Lab Hydrol Water Resources & Hydraul En, Nanjing 210098, Peoples R China; [Jaafari, Abolfazl] Agr Res Educ & Extens Org AREEO, Res Inst Forests & Rangelands, Forest Res Div, Tehran 1496813111, Iran; [Mohanavelu, Aadhityaa] Amrita Vishwa Vidyapeetham, Amrita Sch Engn, Dept Civil Engn, Coimbatore 641112, Tamil Nadu, India; [Kisi, Ozgur] Ilia State Univ, Civil Engn Dept, Tbilisi 0162, Georgia; [Elbeltagi, Ahmed] Mansoura Univ, Fac Agr, Agr Engn Dept, Mansoura 35516, Egypt",,"Jaafari, A (corresponding author), Agr Res Educ & Extens Org AREEO, Res Inst Forests & Rangelands, Forest Res Div, Tehran 1496813111, Iran.; Kisi, O (corresponding author), Ilia State Univ, Civil Engn Dept, Tbilisi 0162, Georgia.",rana@hhu.edu.cn; jaafari@rifr-ac.ir; aadhityaa65@gmail.com; ozgur.kisi@iliauni.edu.ge; ahmedelbeltagy81@mans.edu.eg,"Adnan, Rana Muhammad/ABB-1652-2020; Jaafari, Abolfazl/D-7305-2019","Adnan, Rana Muhammad/0000-0002-2650-8123; Kisi, Ozgur/0000-0001-7847-5872; Jaafari, Abolfazl/0000-0002-3441-6560; Mohanavelu, Aadhityaa/0000-0002-0386-0220",National Key R&D Program of China [2016YFC0402706],This research was supported by the National Key R&D Program of China.

The incorporation of antecedent soil moisture accounts for infiltration and can improve streamflow predictions. Current Natural Resource Conservation Service (NRCS) forecasting methods are replicated, and a comparison is drawn between current NRCS forecasts and proposed forecasting methods using antecedent soil moisture. Current predictors used by the NRCS in regression-based streamflow forecasting include precipitation, streamflow persistence (previous season streamflow volume) and snow water equivalent (SWE) from SNOTEL (snow telemetry) sites. Proposed methods utilize antecedent soil moisture as a predictor variable in addition to the predictors noted above. A decision system was used to segregate data based on antecedent soil moisture conditions (e.g., dry, wet or normal). Principal Components Analysis and Stepwise Linear Regression were applied to generate streamflow forecasts, and numerous statistics were determined to measure forecast skill. The results show that when incorporating antecedent soil moisture, the poor forecasts (i.e., years in which the NRCS forecast differed greatly from the observed value) were improved, while the overall forecast skill remains unchanged. The research presented shows the need to increase the monitoring and collection of soil moisture data in mountainous western U.S. watersheds, as this parameter results in improved forecast skill.","[Oubeidillah, Abdoul] Univ Texas Rio Grande Valley, Dept Civil Engn, Edinburg, TX 78539 USA; [Tootle, Glenn] Univ Alabama, Dept Civil Construct & Environm Engn, Tuscaloosa, AL 35487 USA; [Piechota, Thomas] Chapman Univ, Off Res, Orange, CA 92866 USA",,"Oubeidillah, A (corresponding author), Univ Texas Rio Grande Valley, Dept Civil Engn, Edinburg, TX 78539 USA.",abdoul.oubeidillah@utrgv.edu; gatootle@eng.ua.edu; piechota@chapman.edu,,,University of Wyoming Water Research Program; United States Geological Survey (USGS)United States Geological Survey; Wyoming Water Development Commission; University of Wyoming; National Science Foundation Paleo Perspectives for Climate Change program [AGS-1003393],"This research was funded by the University of Wyoming Water Research Program, the United States Geological Survey (USGS), the Wyoming Water Development Commission, and the University of Wyoming.

Warming temperatures are increasing the rain-snow transition elevation and are limiting the forecasting skill of statistical models relating historical snow water equivalent to streamflow. While physically based methods are available, they require accurate estimations of the spatial and temporal distribution of meteorological variables in complex terrain. Across many mountainous areas, measurements of precipitation and other meteorological variables are limited to a few reference stations and are not adequate to resolve the complex interactions between topography and atmospheric flow. In this paper, we evaluate the ability of the Weather Research and Forecasting (WRF) Model to approximate the inputs required for a physics-based snow model, iSnobal, instead of using meteorological measurements, for the Boise River Basin (BRB) in Idaho, United States. An iSnobal simulation using station data from 40 locations in and around the BRB resulted in an average root-mean-square error (RMSE) of 4.5 mm compared with 12 SNOTEL measurements. Applying WRF forcings alone was associated with an RMSE of 10.5 mm, while including a simple bias correction to the WRF outputs of temperature and precipitation reduced the RMSE to 6.5 mm. The results highlight the utility of using WRF outputs as input to snowmelt models, as all required input variables are spatiotemporally complete. This will have important benefits in areas with sparse measurement networks and will aid snowmelt and runoff forecasting in mountainous basins.","[Havens, Scott; Marks, Danny; Hedrick, Andrew] ARS, Northwest Watershed Res Ctr, USDA, Boise, ID 83712 USA; [FitzGerald, Katelyn; Masarik, Matt; Flores, Alejandro N.; Hedrick, Andrew] Boise State Univ, Dept Geosci, Boise, ID 83725 USA; [Kormos, Patrick] Natl Weather Serv, Colorado Basin River Forecast Ctr, Salt Lake City, UT USA",,"Havens, S (corresponding author), ARS, Northwest Watershed Res Ctr, USDA, Boise, ID 83712 USA.",scott.havens@ars.usda.gov,"; Flores, Alejandro/D-4332-2013","Hedrick, Andrew/0000-0001-9511-1341; FitzGerald, Katelyn/0000-0003-4184-1917; Flores, Alejandro/0000-0002-7240-9265; Havens, Scott/0000-0002-6933-4485","USDA-ARS CRIS Snow and Hydrologic Processes in the Intermountain West [5362-13610-008-00D]; USDA-NRCS Water and Climate Center-Portland, Oregon [60-5362-4-003]; NASA-JPL Airborne Snow Observatory [58-2052-5-006]; USGSUnited States Geological Survey [60-5362-4-002]; USBR [60-5362-3-002]; NSF Reynolds Creek CZO Project [58-5362-4-004]","The data and analysis presented were funded in part by USDA-ARS CRIS Snow and Hydrologic Processes in the Intermountain West (5362-13610-008-00D), USDA-NRCS Water and Climate Center-Portland, Oregon (60-5362-4-003), NASA-JPL Airborne Snow Observatory (58-2052-5-006), USGS (60-5362-4-002), USBR (60-5362-3-002), and NSF Reynolds Creek CZO Project (58-5362-4-004).

The GERD has become a focal point of geopolitical tensions because it will allow Ethiopia greater control over the Blue Nile River, Egypt's main source of freshwater. To inform discussions of filling plans and responses, we created a probabilistic seasonal forecast for Upper Blue Nile rainfall and streamflow in the GERD basin. Eight statistical models and eight dynamical models were used to forecast the rainy season (June-September), which were then converted into river flow for June-December 2018. Both statistical and dynamical models predicted a high probability of average to above average rainfall as well as Upper Blue Nile flow in the GERD basin. Actual summer precipitation in 2018 was slightly below the long-term mean but well within the range considered to be near normal. Leveraging the increasingly online media landscape for science communication, we made the forecast publicly available through a blog and shared with regional decision-makers in advance of the 2018 rainy season. The blog attracted news coverage in the region focusing primarily on the relatively low likelihood of below-average Nile flow across the forecast ensemble. When asked for feedback on the blog, Ethiopian decision-makers and forecasters reported that flow predictions included in our blog were useful and not part of existing products. Access and comprehension were noted barriers to the use of these types of forecasts, consistent with prior research in forecast communication and dissemination. Forecasts available on such blogs can inform a shared understanding among decision-makers in the management of transboundary waters, yet effective communication and dissemination remain a challenge.","[Blum, Annalise G.; Zaitchik, Ben; Zhang, Ying; Alemneh, Temesgen] Johns Hopkins Univ, Dept Earth & Planetary Sci, Baltimore, MD 21218 USA; [Alexander, Sarah; Wu, Shu; Block, Paul] Univ Wisconsin, Civil & Environm Engn, Madison, WI USA; [Shukla, Shraddhanand] Univ Calif Santa Barbara, Dept Geog, Santa Barbara, CA 93106 USA",,"Blum, AG (corresponding author), Johns Hopkins Univ, Dept Earth & Planetary Sci, Baltimore, MD 21218 USA.",annalise@jhu.edu,,"Zaitchik, Benjamin/0000-0002-0698-0658; Alexander, Sarah/0000-0003-4518-2875; WU, SHU/0000-0002-8407-8440","NSFNational Science Foundation (NSF) [BCS-1639214, 1545874]; US Geological Survey (USGS)United States Geological Survey [G09AC000001]; NASANational Aeronautics & Space Administration (NASA) [NNX15AL46G]",This work was partially supported by NSF INFEWS award BCS-1639214 and NSF PIRE award 1545874.

This study investigates the performance of four popular models for short-term streamflow forecasting, with particular emphasis on the combination of each model with wavelet transform (WT). The autoregressive (AR) model, autoregressive moving average (ARMA) model, artificial neural network (ANN) model, and linear regression (LR) model are used as the base models, and WT-AR, WT-ARMA, WT-ANN, and WT-LR models are used as the composite or hybrid models. These eight models are applied for short-term forecasting of daily streamflow time series in two different river basins in China. Streamflow data from two stations (Yingluoxia and Zhamashike) in the Heihe River basin of North China and two stations (Wuzhou and Longchuan) in the Pearl River basin of South China are considered, and forecasts are made 1-day, 2-day, and 3-day ahead. The accuracy of the models is evaluated using three widely used performance measures: root mean square error, mean absolute error, and correlation coefficient (R). The performances of the eight models are compared, and the influencing role of the wavelet transform in the hybrid models is discussed. The results suggest that the WT-ANN and ANN models are more suitable for the northern basin but perform poorly for the southern basin, while the WT-ARMA model is more suitable for the southern basin. The results also suggest that the wavelet-based hybrid models are better than the single models particularly for longer lead times, offering gradual improvement with increasing lead time. Therefore, the wavelet-based models are especially useful for areas that suffer from frequent natural disasters, fragile ecological environment, and poor self-regulations.","[Sun, Yuqing; Niu, Jun] China Agr Univ, Ctr Agr Water Res China, Beijing 100083, Peoples R China; [Sun, Yuqing; Niu, Jun] Minist Agr & Rural Affairs, Wuwei Expt Stn Efficient Water Use Agr, Wuwei 733000, Peoples R China; [Sivakumar, Bellie] Indian Inst Technol, Dept Civil Engn, Powai 400076, India",,"Niu, J (corresponding author), China Agr Univ, Ctr Agr Water Res China, Beijing 100083, Peoples R China.; Niu, J (corresponding author), Minist Agr & Rural Affairs, Wuwei Expt Stn Efficient Water Use Agr, Wuwei 733000, Peoples R China.",niuj@cau.edu.cn; b.sivakumar@iitb.ac.in,,"Niu, Jun/0000-0003-4245-5997",National Natural Science Foundation of ChinaNational Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC) [51679233]; National Key Research and Development Plan of China [2016YFC0400207],"The authors are grateful for the financial support provided by the National Natural Science Foundation of China (51679233) and the National Key Research and Development Plan of China (2016YFC0400207).

In this work, we present and appraise a new simple and flexible methodology for hydrological time series forecasting. This methodology relies on (a) at least two individual forecasting methods and (b) the median combiner of forecasts. The appraisal is made by using a big dataset consisted of 90-year-long mean annual river flow time series from approximately 600 stations. Covering large parts of North America and Europe, these stations represent various climate and catchment characteristics, and thus can collectively support benchmarking. Five individual forecasting methods and 26 variants of the introduced methodology are applied to each time series. The application is made in one-step ahead forecasting mode. The individual methods are the last-observation benchmark, simple exponential smoothing, complex exponential smoothing, automatic autoregressive fractionally integrated moving average (ARFIMA) and Facebook's Prophet, while the 26 variants are defined by all the possible combinations (per two, three, four or five) of the five afore-mentioned methods. The new methodology is identified as well-performing in the long run, especially when more than two individual forecasting methods are combined within its framework. Moreover, the possibility of case-informed integrations of diverse hydrological forecasting methods within systematic frameworks is algorithmically investigated and discussed. The related investigations encompass linear regression analyses, which aim at finding interpretable relationships between the values of a representative forecasting performance metric and the values of selected river flow statistics. We find only loose (but not negligible) relationships between the formed variable sets. These relationships could be exploited for improving (to some extent) future forecasting applications. The results of our big data forecasting experiment are lastly exploited for characterizing -in relative terms- one-year ahead river flow predictability. We believe that our findings have both practical and theoretical implications.","[Papacharalampous, Georgia; Tyralis, Hristos] Natl Tech Univ Athens, Sch Civil Engn, Dept Water Resources & Environm Engn, Heroon Polytech 5, Zografos 15780, Greece; [Tyralis, Hristos] Hellen Air Force, Air Force Support Command, Elefsina Air Base 19200, Elefsina, Greece",,"Papacharalampous, G (corresponding author), Natl Tech Univ Athens, Sch Civil Engn, Dept Water Resources & Environm Engn, Heroon Polytech 5, Zografos 15780, Greece.",papacharalampous.georgia@gmail.com; montchrister@gmail.com,"Tyralis, Hristos/A-1480-2019; Papacharalampous, Georgia/A-6617-2019","Tyralis, Hristos/0000-0002-8932-4997; Papacharalampous, Georgia/0000-0001-5446-954X",,,,133,8,8,2,11,ELSEVIER,AMSTERDAM,"RADARWEG 29, 1043 NX AMSTERDAM, NETHERLANDS",0022-1694,1879-2707,,J HYDROL,J.

Especially, the flood damage has been severely occurred during the flood season almost every year in Korea. For an example, we had the localized heavy rainfalls for 54 days in flood season of 2020 and had huge property damage and loss of life. Therefore, the study needs to be conducted to improve the predictive power of seasonal time-scale forecasts spanning one to several months for the damage reduction and prevention. In this regard, this study aims to provide a priori predictions (several months ahead) of the climate variable at target sites with a statistical method based on teleconnection with global climatic conditions. Herein, the paradigm of the temperature and precipitation prediction in the Geum river basin in Korea is presented. The purposes of the study are also (1) to analyse the characteristics of summer temperatures and precipitation according to the occurrence of El Nino/La Nina and (2) to suggest a seasonal prediction model that can consider the effects of the occurrence of El Nino and La Nina during the flood season. The model is constructed by classifying the data period into El Nino, La Nina, and neutral status. Then we have shown that the prediction model improves the predictive power for the predictions of climate variables such as temperature and precipitation at mid-latitude stations which Korea is located. Therefore, this study demonstrates the possibility of improving the predictive power for forecasting temperature and precipitation by the prediction model considering climate variability.","[Jung, Jaewon] Korea Inst Civil Engn & Bldg Technol, Dept Hydro Sci & Engn Res, Goyang 10223, Gyeonggi Do, South Korea; [Kim, Hung Soo] Inha Univ, Dept Civil Engn, Incheon 22212, South Korea",,"Kim, HS (corresponding author), Inha Univ, Dept Civil Engn, Incheon 22212, South Korea.",sookim@inha.ac.kr,,,National Research Foundation of Korea (NRF) - Korea government (MSIT) [2017R1A2B3005695],This work was supported by the National Research Foundation of Korea (NRF) Grant funded by the Korea government (MSIT) (No. 2017R1A2B3005695).,,42,0,0,1,1,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"ONE NEW YORK PLAZA, SUITE 4600, NEW YORK, NY, UNITED STATES",2196-4092,,,GEOSCI LETT,Geosci.

The Steam Assisted Gravity Drainage (SAGD) provides more efficient recovery of unconventional oil resources, such as heavy oil and bitumen, as compared to the other thermal recovery methods. The drawback associated with SAGD or other thermal methods is that they are economically non-profitable when applied to the deep and thin reservoirs. Environmental concerns related to land, water, and air also hinder the application of the aforementioned methods. These issues have provoked reservoir engineers to employ a remarkable alternate such as polymer flooding recovery technique in heavy oil reservoirs. Quick and practical decision-making process in presence of uncertainty-based reservoir development scenarios is a notable stimuli for reservoir management teams to find substitute modeling techniques for future performance forecasting of heavy oil reservoirs. Cognitive data-driven analytics, including artificial and computational intelligence techniques, statistical analyses, and data-mining practices, offers an attractive alternate especially in presence of high-dimensional data space and predictive modeling of an extremely nonlinear system. This study utilizes an extensive data set from the half-century review of laboratory to field scales polymer flooding in heavy oil reservoirs provided by Saboorian-Jooybari et al. (2015) and (2016). The exploratory data analysis is implemented to construct a comprehensive training data set from polymer flooding experimental and field data, which involves various attributes describing characteristics associated with reservoir heterogeneities and pertinent operating parameters. Demonstrated results imply that this advanced data-driven modeling technique has a great potential to be integrated into all reservoir development tools for future performance predictions of the underlying processes.","[Amirian, Ehsan; Chen, Zhangxin] Univ Calgary, Schulich Sch Engn, Dept Chem & Petr Engn, 2500 Univ Dr NW, Calgary, AB T2N 1N4, Canada; [Dejam, Morteza] Univ Wyoming, Coll Engn & Appl Sci, Dept Petr Engn, 1000 E Univ Ave, Laramie, WY 82071 USA",,"Amirian, E (corresponding author), Univ Calgary, Schulich Sch Engn, Dept Chem & Petr Engn, 2500 Univ Dr NW, Calgary, AB T2N 1N4, Canada.",eamirian@ucalgary.ca,"Dejam, Morteza/F-5313-2011","Dejam, Morteza/0000-0002-3435-3838; Chen, Zhangxin/0000-0002-9107-1925",NSERC/AI-EES (AERI)/Foundation CMG and AITF (iCORE) Chairs in the Department of Chemical and Petroleum Engineering at the University of Calgary,The financial support of NSERC/AI-EES (AERI)/Foundation CMG and AITF (iCORE) Chairs in the Department of Chemical and Petroleum Engineering at the University of Calgary is acknowledged.,,89,106,108,11,66,ELSEVIER SCI LTD,OXFORD,"THE BOULEVARD, LANGFORD LANE, KIDLINGTON, OXFORD OX5 1GB, OXON, ENGLAND",0016-2361,1873-7153,,FUEL,Fuel,MAR 15,2018,216,,,,,,83,100,,10.1016/j.fuel.2017.11.110,,,18,"Energy & Fuels; Engineering, Chemical",Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),Energy & Fuels; Engineering,FZ7XJ,WOS:000427818100011,,,Y,N,2022-02-17

Climate Forecast System Reanalysis (CFSR) data offer a promising database for overcoming the limitations in availability and reliability of climatological data and, hence, for understanding the evapotranspiration process. Using these data on grid-by-grid daily, seasonal and yearly scales, the present study attempts to advance the spatio-temporal evaluation of two radiation-based and three temperature-based methods for estimating potential evapotranspiration (PET) against estimates of grass reference evapotranspiration (ETo) by FAO Penman-Monteith method (FAO-PM). The analysis was performed for the period 1979-2013, considering the second largest (79 000 km(2)) river system in Ethiopia, that is, Omo-Gibe basin, which accommodates national parks and vast hydropower, cultivation and afforestation developments and discharges its flow to Lake Turkana in Kenya. Despite the large regional variations in climate and elevation, the results in overall emphasize the outperformance of the simple temperature method, viz. Hargreaves-Samani method, in capturing both the annual and seasonal FAO-PM estimates. Calibration of the Hargreaves-Samani equation is, however, a requisite for spectacular improvement of its performance. Accordingly, new coefficients of the equation are proposed. The annual trends in the basin's ETo increased with rising temperature and decreasing relative humidity, wind speed, and solar radiation, but with decreasing (increasing) rainfall in the upper region (the middle and lower regions). It is deduced that trends in simple methods do not necessarily reflect the true trends in ETo. Annual ETo decreases with increasing elevation and annual rainfall. The present findings are discussed in the context of a worldwide literature, thereby improving the understanding of the best performing PET methods in similar data-scarce national or transboundary rivers basin in Ethiopia, the region or worldwide. The wider implications regarding water loss from reservoirs and the rain-fed food and sugar production in the basin under study are also highlighted.","[Woldesenbet, Tekalegn Ayele] Addis Ababa Univ, Ethiopian Inst Water Resources, POB 150461, Addis Ababa, Ethiopia; [Elagib, Nadir Ahmed] Univ Cologne, Inst Geog, Fac Math & Nat Sci, Cologne, Germany",,"Woldesenbet, TA (corresponding author), Addis Ababa Univ, Ethiopian Inst Water Resources, POB 150461, Addis Ababa, Ethiopia.",tekalegnay@yahoo.com,"Woldesenbet, Tekalegn Ayele/I-6352-2019; Elagib, Nadir/J-3413-2017","Woldesenbet, Tekalegn Ayele/0000-0003-1287-1949; Elagib, Nadir/0000-0001-6252-7586",,,,90,0,0,4,4,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0885-6087,1099-1085,,HYDROL PROCESS,Hydrol.

A common approach is to bias-correct the general circulation model (GCM) forecasts prior to generating the streamflow forecasts. Less attention has been paid to the issue of bias-corrected streamflow forecasts that were generated by GCM forecasts. This study compares the effect of bias-corrected GCM forecasts and bias-corrected streamflow outputs on the improvement of streamflow forecast efficiency. Based on the Upper Hanjiang River Basin (UHRB), the authors compare three forecasting scenarios: original forecasts, bias-corrected precipitation forecasts and bias-corrected streamflow forecasts. We apply the quantile mapping method to bias-correct precipitation forecasts and the linear scaling method to bias-correct the original streamflow forecasts. A semi-distributed hydrological model, namely the Tsinghua Representative Elementary Watershed (THREW) model, is employed to transform precipitation into streamflow. The effects of bias-corrected precipitation and bias-corrected streamflow are assessed in terms of accuracy, reliability, sharpness and overall performance. The results show that both bias-corrected precipitation and bias-corrected streamflow can considerably increase the overall forecast skill in comparison to the original streamflow forecasts. Bias-corrected precipitation contributes mainly to improving the forecast reliability and sharpness, while bias-corrected streamflow is successful in increasing the forecast accuracy and overall performance of the ensemble forecasts.","[Li, Yilu; Tian, Fuqiang] Tsinghua Univ, Dept Hydraul Engn, State Key Lab Hydrosci & Engn, Beijing 100084, Peoples R China; [Li, Yilu; Jiang, Yunzhong; Lei, Xiaohui; Duan, Hao] China Inst Water Resources & Hydropower Res, State Key Lab Simulat & Regulat Water Cycles Rive, Beijing 100038, Peoples R China; [Lu, Hui] Tsinghua Univ, Dept Earth Syst Sci, Minist Educ, Key Lab Earth Syst Modeling, Beijing 100084, Peoples R China",,"Tian, FQ (corresponding author), Tsinghua Univ, Dept Hydraul Engn, State Key Lab Hydrosci & Engn, Beijing 100084, Peoples R China.; Lei, XH (corresponding author), China Inst Water Resources & Hydropower Res, State Key Lab Simulat & Regulat Water Cycles Rive, Beijing 100038, Peoples R China.",liyilu15@mails.tsinghua.edu.cn; lark@iwhr.com; lxh@iwhr.com; tianfq@tsinghua.edu.cn; qiying624@outlook.com; luhui@mail.tsinghua.edu.cn,"Nan, Yi/W-3683-2019; Lu, Hui/H-4349-2011; lei, xiaohui/P-9669-2017; Tian, Fuqiang/M-9958-2013","Lu, Hui/0000-0003-1640-239X; Tian, Fuqiang/0000-0001-9414-7019",,,,59,1,1,4,22,MDPI,BASEL,"ST ALBAN-ANLAGE 66, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND",,2073-4441,,WATER-SUI,Water,FEB,2018,10,2,,,,,,,177,10.3390/w10020177,,,17,Environmental Sciences; Water Resources,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),Environmental Sciences & Ecology; Water Resources,FY4ES,WOS:000426775500087,,"gold, Green Submitted",,,2022-02-17

This study simulates potential conversion of agricultural lands to built-up areas using the land transformation model (LTM), which integrates geographical information systems (GIS) and an artificial neural network (ANN). Historical drivers of the expansion of built-up areas are identified and validated through the application of LTM to land cover maps from 1988 to 2015. Identified drivers include distance to roads, distance to trails, distance to the Seven Lakes, distance to existing built-up areas, slopes and population density per barangay. Results from the percent correct matrix (PCM) were 79.88 per cent for the 1988-2003 runs and 66.42 per cent for the 2003-2015 runs, while the Kappa statistic for both time periods was higher than 0.60, which indicates high levels of agreement. Forecasted scenarios were business-as-usual (BAU) growth, doubled growth and strict law implementation protecting the vicinity around the Seven Lakes and other natural areas. In the BAU scenario, urban expansion spread out along the road networks. The doubled growth scenario showed that further expansion will likely extend around the proximity of the lakes, which may adversely affect the livelihoods of the local fishing communities. As such, it was recommended that preventive measures, such as strict implementation of buffer zones coupled with regular monitoring, be taken to manage land use in the surrounding lake areas.","[Laura Quintal, Anna; Kendra Gotangco, Charlotte; Leah Guzman, Maria Aileen] Ateneo Manila Univ, Dept Environm Sci, Quezon City 1108, Philippines",,"Gotangco, CK (corresponding author), Ateneo Manila Univ, Dept Environm Sci, Quezon City 1108, Philippines.",kgotangco@ateneo.edu,,"Gotangco Gonzales, Charlotte Kendra/0000-0002-3436-9813",University Research Council of Ateneo de Manila University as part of the umbrella project entitled 'Nutrient Dynamics and Spatial Modeling in Lake Palakpakin',"This study was partially funded by the University Research Council of Ateneo de Manila University as part of the umbrella project entitled 'Nutrient Dynamics and Spatial Modeling in Lake Palakpakin' implemented by Dr Aileen Guzman and Dr Ian Navarrette.

Long-term optimal reservoir storage provides temporal space to optimize operation of the dams at short-term based on forecasted reservoir inflow. This study asks if there is an added benefit of co-optimization of operations at long- and short-term scales for hydropower generation. The multi-objective optimization problem at both the temporal scales was simultaneously solved considering Pareto optimality between conflicting objectives. Constraints pertaining to flood control, dam safety, and environmental flow were imposed. The proposed scheme was implemented over a network of Blue Mesa, Morrow Point, and Crystal dams in the Upper Colorado Basin. Ensemble forecast forcings from publicly available numerical weather prediction and climate models were used as inputs for the daily and monthly scale inflow forecasts. The results show improvements of 41%, 27%, and 15% in hydropower generation using the co-optimization during wet, moderate, and dry years, respectively, against a benchmark that neglects inflow forecasts. This study demonstrates added benefit of co-optimizing the operations for hydropower generation based on short- and long-term forecasted reservoir inflow. Given that most dams today operate as a network in a river basin, we recommend moving away from single dam and single time scale optimization to a multiple-dam with long- and short-term scale co-optimization-based operations to make renewable energy generation more efficient.","[Ahmad, Shahryar Khalique; Hossain, Faisal] Univ Washington, Dept Civil & Environm Engn, More Hall 201, Seattle, WA 98195 USA",,"Hossain, F (corresponding author), Univ Washington, Dept Civil & Environm Engn, More Hall 201, Seattle, WA 98195 USA.",fhossain@uw.edu,"Ahmad, Shahryar/AAM-5612-2021",,"NASA Applied Science Program grant in Water Resources [NNX15AC63G, NNX16AQ54G]",This work was supported by the NASA Applied Science Program grant in Water Resources Nos.

Predicting the amount of dissolved oxygen (DO) of a water environment is vital and can improve the aquaculture production efficiency. Using water quality and meteorological data for the Changdang Lake (Jiangsu, China) from 2014 to 2016, this study proposes a new strategy for predicting short-term DO based on K-means clustering and extreme learning machine (ELM) neural networks. First, the weights of the environmental factors on the DO are obtained using Pearson correlation analysis, and similar days are defined. Subsequently, according to the defined similarity, the K-means clustering algorithm divides the historical data into several clusters and identifies similar sample sets that have characteristics that are similar to the forecast day. Finally, after the ELM neural network model establishes the training and testing data, the DO is predicted using the similar sample set and the real-time environmental factors of the forecast days as input data. The prediction efficiency of our model was compared to that of others in terms of the mean absolute percentage error and the mean square error. The experimental results showed that our approach had higher forecasting accuracy and faster computation speed, which is beneficial for water management.","[Huan, J.; Cao, W.

Forecasts generated from the calibrated models are further bias-corrected to compensate for the deficiencies within the models, and then probabilistically merged using a variety of model averaging techniques. Use of bias-corrected SPPs in streamflow forecasting applications can overcome several issues associated with sparsely gauged basins and enable robust forecasting capabilities. Bias correction of streamflow significantly improves the forecasts in terms of accuracy and precision for all different cases considered. Results show that the merging of individual forecasts from different MPCs provides additional improvements. All the merging techniques applied in this study produce similar results, however, the Inverse Weighted Averaging (IVA) proves to be slightly superior in most cases.

In this paper, the projection of future climate in the LMRB is explored by focusing on the temperature change and extreme temperature events. First, the authors evaluate the bias of temperature simulated by the Weather Research and Forecasting model. Then, correction is made for the simulation by comparing with observation based on the non-parametric quantile mapping using robust empirical quantiles (RQUANT) method. Furthermore, using the corrected model results, the future climate projections of temperature and extreme temperature events in this basin during 2016-35, 2046-65, and 2080-99 are analyzed. The study shows that RQUANT can effectively reduce the bias of simulation results. After correction, the simulation can capture the spatial features and trends of mean temperature over the LMRB, as well as the extreme temperature events. Besides, it can reproduce the spatial and temporal distributions of the major modes. In the future, the temperature will keep increasing, and the warming in the southern basin will be more intense in the wet season than the dry season. The number of extreme high-temperature days exhibits an increasing trend, while the number of extreme low-temperature days shows a decreasing trend. Based on empirical orthogonal function analysis, the dominant feature of temperature over this basin shows a consistent change. The second mode shows a seesaw pattern.","[Sun Chang; Xiao Ziniu] Chinese Acad Sci, Inst Atmospher Phys, State Key Lab Numer Modeling Atmospher Sci & Geop, Beijing, Peoples R China; [Sun Chang; Xiao Ziniu] Univ Chinese Acad Sci, Coll Earth & Planetary Sci, Beijing, Peoples R China; [Sun Jianqi; Yu Entao] Chinese Acad Sci, Nansen Zhu Int Res Ctr, Inst Atmospher Phys, Beijing, Peoples R China",,"Xiao, ZN (corresponding author), Chinese Acad Sci, Inst Atmospher Phys, State Key Lab Numer Modeling Atmospher Sci & Geop, Beijing, Peoples R China.; Xiao, ZN (corresponding author), Univ Chinese Acad Sci, Coll Earth & Planetary Sci, Beijing, Peoples R China.",xiaozn@lasg.iap.ac.cn,"XIAO, ZINIU/AAL-3046-2020; Sun, Jianqi/A-7084-2016","Sun, Jianqi/0000-0002-3879-6986; XIAO, ZINIU/0000-0003-0509-5267","External Cooperation Program of Bureau of International Co-operation, Chinese Academy of Sciences [GJHZ1729]; Key Program of the Natural Science Foundation of Yunnan Province of China [2016FA041]","This work was supported by the External Cooperation Program of Bureau of International Co-operation, Chinese Academy of Sciences [grant number GJHZ1729] and the Key Program of the Natural Science Foundation of Yunnan Province of China [grant number 2016FA041].",,16,4,5,3,6,KEAI PUBLISHING LTD,BEIJING,"16 DONGHUANGCHENGGEN NORTH ST, BEIJING, DONGHENG DISTRICT 100717, PEOPLES R CHINA",1674-2834,2376-6123,,ATMOS OCEAN SCI LETT,Atmos.

It has been applied in thousands of lakes worldwide. However, it employed the Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) as the calibration method, which was proposed more than 20 years ago. In this study, 12 advanced optimization algorithms proposed during the recent few years were implemented to calibrate and validate the air2water model. Daily observed water temperature in temperate lakes (22 lowland lakes in Poland) were used to evaluate the model performance. Each optimizer was run 30 times with 3 different settings of the maximum number of function calls, 5000, 20,000, and 100,000. We have found that the PSO method used in the original air2water model performs relatively poor compared with most of the recent algorithms, and the majority of recently proposed algorithms reach the similar best solutions on many lakes when the highest number of function calls is allowed. However, only the HARD-DE (hierarchical archive-based mutation strategy with depth information of differential evolution) algorithm is never outperformed by any competitor, irrespective which lake and maximum number of function calls is considered. As a result, we highly recommend using HARD-DE as the calibration method for the air2water model in the future studies.","[Zhu, Senlin; Ji, Qingfeng] Yangzhou Univ, Coll Hydraul Sci & Engn, Yangzhou 225127, Jiangsu, Peoples R China; [Piotrowski, Adam P.; Napiorkowski, Jaroslaw J.] Polish Acad Sci, Inst Geophys, Ks Janusza 64, PL-01452 Warsaw, Poland; [Ptak, Mariusz] Adam Mickiewicz Univ, Dept Hydrol & Water Management, Krygowskiego 10, PL-61680 Poznan, Poland; [Dai, Jiangyu] Nanjing Hydraul Res Inst, Nanjing 210029, Peoples R China",,"Zhu, SL (corresponding author), Yangzhou Univ, Coll Hydraul Sci & Engn, Yangzhou 225127, Jiangsu, Peoples R China.; Dai, JY (corresponding author), Nanjing Hydraul Res Inst, Nanjing 210029, Peoples R China.",slzhu@yzu.edu.cn; adampp@igf.edu.pl; marp114@wp.pl; j.napiorkowski@igf.edu.pl; jydai@nhri.cn; qfji@yzu.edu.cn,"Napiorkowski, Jaroslaw J/J-1050-2016","Napiorkowski, Jaroslaw J/0000-0002-0273-4193; Ptak, Mariusz/0000-0003-1225-1686","Institute of Geophysics, Polish Academy of Sciences (Ministry of Science and Higher Education of Poland) [3841/E-41/S/2019]; Hydraulic Research Institute of Jiangsu Province [BM2018028]","The authors acknowledge the Institute of Meteorology and Water Management-National Research Institute in Poland for providing the data used in this study.

In the last decade, flood forecasting started the operational mode of so-called ensemble prediction systems following the success of the use of ensembles for weather forecasting. These probabilistic approaches acknowledge the presence of unavoidable variability and uncertainty when larger areas are considered and explicitly introduce them into the model results. Now that highly detailed numerical weather predictions and high-performance computing are becoming more common, physically based landslide forecasting for larger areas is becoming feasible, and the landslide research community could benefit from the experiences that have been reported from flood forecasting using ensemble predictions. This paper reviews and summarizes concepts of ensemble prediction in hydrology and discusses how these could facilitate improved landslide forecasting. In addition, a prototype landslide forecasting system utilizing the physically based TRIGRS (Transient Rainfall Infiltration and Grid-Based Regional Slope-Stability) model is presented to highlight how such forecasting systems could be implemented. The paper concludes with a discussion of challenges related to parameter variability and uncertainty, calibration and validation, and computational concerns.","[Canli, Ekrem; Mergili, Martin; Thiebes, Benni; Glade, Thomas] Univ Vienna, Dept Geog & Reg Res, Univ Str 7, A-1010 Vienna, Austria; [Mergili, Martin] Univ Nat Resources & Life Sci, Inst Appl Geol, Gregor Mendel Str 33, A-1180 Vienna, Austria; [Thiebes, Benni] German Comm Disaster Reduct DKKV, Kaiser Friedrich Str 13, D-53113 Bonn, Germany",,"Canli, E (corresponding author), Univ Vienna, Dept Geog & Reg Res, Univ Str 7, A-1010 Vienna, Austria.",ekrem.canli@univie.ac.at,"thiebes, benni/H-3626-2019; Glade, Thomas/H-6325-2017","thiebes, benni/0000-0002-9067-2120; Glade, Thomas/0000-0001-9676-4416; Canli, Ekrem/0000-0002-0890-5969; Mergili, Martin/0000-0001-5085-4846",Provincial Government of Lower Austria; University of Vienna,The authors thank the Provincial Government of Lower Austria for their support.

The ability of three soft computing methods, least square support vector machine (LSSVM), fuzzy genetic algorithm (FGA) and M5 model tree (M5T), in forecasting daily and monthly stream flows of poorly gauged mountainous watershed using nearby hydro-meteorological data is investigated in the current study. In the first application, monthly stream flows of Hunza river are forecasted using local stream flow data of Hunza and precipitation and temperature data of nearby station. LSSVM provides slightly better forecasts than the FGA and M5T models. Stream flow and temperature inputs generally give better forecasts compared to other inputs. In the second application, daily stream flows of Hunza river are forecasted using local stream flow data of Hunza and precipitation and temperature data of nearby station. Better results are obtained from the models comprising only stream flow inputs. In general, a better accuracy is obtained from LSSVM models in relative to the FGA and M5T. The results indicate that the monthly and daily stream flows of Hunza can be accurately forecasted by using only nearby climatic data. In the third application, daily stream flows of Hunza river are forecasted using local stream flow and climatic data and the models' accuracy is slightly increased in relative to the previous applications.

Two states based on stations own data and upstream stations data were considered for RSF modeling of Housatonic River during the period of 1941-2018. Ensemble Empirical Mode Decomposition (EEMD) and Variational Mode Decomposition (VMD) methods were used for enhancing the streamflow point forecasting accuracy. Interval Prediction (PI) was applied for tolerating increased uncertainty. Results showed that in the state 1, the error criterion value for the superior model decreased from 0.155 to 0.082 and 0.09 for the EEMD- and VMD-based models, respectively. Generally, hybrid models increased the modeling accuracy between 20 and 40%. Via the integrated approaches, the upstream stations data was successfully used for streamflow prediction of stations without data. In this state, the PI coverage probability values for the VMD-based model were approximately 12% higher than the single model. Generally, the VMD-based model led to more desirable results due to having higher PI coverage probability and lower mean PI width values. HIGHLIGHTS AI methods were applied to model the RSF in successive hydrometric stations. To obtain a model with higher efficiency EEMD and VMD techniques were applied. Interval prediction was applied for providing more details for practical operation decisions.","[Ghasempour, Roghayeh; Roushangar, Kiyoumars] Univ Tabriz, Fac Civil Engn, Dept Water Resource Engn, Tabriz, Iran; [Azamathulla, Hazi Mohammad] Univ West Indies St Augustine, Dept Civil & Environm Engn, St Augustine, Trinidad Tobago; [Roushangar, Kiyoumars] Univ Tabriz, Ctr Excellence Hydroinformat, Tabriz, Iran",,"Azamathulla, HM (corresponding author), Univ West Indies St Augustine, Dept Civil & Environm Engn, St Augustine, Trinidad Tobago.",hazi.azamathulla@sta.uwi.edu,"Mohammad, Azamathulla Hazi/F-6600-2010",,,,,38,0,0,1,3,IWA PUBLISHING,LONDON,"REPUBLIC-EXPORT BLDG, UNITS 1 04 & 1 05, 1 CLOVE CRESCENT, LONDON, ENGLAND",1606-9749,1607-0798,,WATER SUPPLY,Water Supply,NOV,2021,21,7,,,,,3960,3975,,10.2166/ws.2021.151,,MAY 2021,16,"Engineering, Environmental; Environmental Sciences; Water Resources",Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),Engineering; Environmental Sciences & Ecology; Water Resources,WU6JK,WOS:000654244700001,,gold,,,2022-02-17

Many of its principles are similar to those espoused in agroecology, begetting the question of what One Health can contribute-in practice-to preventing plant disease. Here we describe four knowledge challenges for plant health management that have arisen from the One Health experience for zoonotic diseases that could boost prospects for novel approaches to plant disease surveillance, prediction, and prevention. The challenges are to (a) uncover reservoirs and revise pathogen life histories, (b) elucidate drivers of virulence beyond the context of direct host-pathogen interactions, (c) account for the natural highways of long-distance dissemination (i.e., surface water and air mass movement), and (d) update disease forecasts in the face of changing land use, cultivation practices, and climate. Furthermore, we note that implementation of a One Health approach to disease surveillance and prevention will require mobilization of tools to deal with the representation and accessibility of massive and heterogeneous data and knowledge; with knowledge inference, data science, modelling, and pattern recognition; and multi-actor approaches that unite different sectors of society as well as different scientific disciplines. The infrastructure to build and the obstacles to overcome for a bona fide One Health approach to disease surveillance and prevention are key commonalities where actors in the efforts to prevent zoonotic diseases and plant disease can work together for the management of biodiversity and consequently human, animal, and plant health.","[Morris, Cindy E.] INRAE, Pathol Vegetale, F-84140 Montfavet, France; [Geniaux, Ghislain] INRAE, Ecodev, Avignon, France; [Nedellec, Claire] Univ Paris Saclay, INRAE, Math & Informat Appliquees Genome Environm, Jouy En Josas, France; [Sauvion, Nicolas] Univ Montpellier, IRD, Inst Agro, CIRAD,PHIM Plant Hlth Inst,INRAE, Montpellier, France; [Soubeyrand, Samuel] INRAE, BioSP, Avignon, France",,"Morris, CE (corresponding author), INRAE, Pathol Vegetale, F-84140 Montfavet, France.",cindy.morris@inrae.fr,"Sauvion, Nicolas/X-8928-2018","Sauvion, Nicolas/0000-0002-1641-5871; Morris, Cindy E./0000-0002-9135-1812","French National Research AgencyFrench National Research Agency (ANR) [17-CE32-0004, 20-PCPA-0002]","French National Research Agency, Grant/ Award Number: 17-CE32-0004 and 20-PCPA-0002",,97,1,1,10,10,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0032-0862,1365-3059,,PLANT PATHOL,Plant Pathol.,JAN,2022,71,1,,,SI,,86,97,,10.1111/ppa.13446,,AUG 2021,12,Agronomy; Plant Sciences,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),Agriculture; Plant Sciences,XL5AT,WOS:000684419800001,,Green Submitted,,,2022-02-17

Climate change influences species and may exacerbate the risk of forest diseases, such as the pine wilt disease. The maximum entropy (MaxEnt) model was used in this study to identify the current and potential distribution and habitat suitability of three pine species and B. xylophilus in China. Further, the potential distribution was modeled using the current (1970-2000) and the projected (2050 and 2070) climate data based on two representative concentration pathways (RCP 2.6 and RCP 8.5), and fairly robust prediction results were obtained. Our model identified that the area south of the Yangtze River in China was the most severely affected place by pine wilt disease, and the eastern foothills of the Tibetan Plateau acted as a geographical barrier to pest distribution. Bioclimatic variables related to temperature influenced pine trees' distribution, while those related to precipitation affected B. xylophilus's distribution. In the future, the suitable area of B. xylophilus will continue to increase; the shifts in the center of gravity of the suitable habitats of the three pine species and B. xylophilus will be different under climate change. The area ideal for pine trees will migrate slightly northward under RCP 8.5. The pine species will continue to face B. xylophilus threat in 2050 and 2070 under the two distinct climate change scenarios. Therefore, we should plan appropriate measures to prevent its expansion. Predicting the distribution of pine species and the impact of climate change on forest diseases is critical for controlling the pests according to local conditions. Thus, the MaxEnt model proposed in this study can be potentially used to forecast the species distribution and disease risks and provide guidance for the timely prevention and management of B. xylophilus.","[Tang, Xinggang; Yuan, Yingdan; Zhang, Jinchi] Nanjing Forestry Univ, Jiangsu Prov Key Lab Soil & Water Conservat & Eco, Coinnovat Ctr Sustainable Forestry Southern China, Nanjing, Peoples R China; [Li, Xiangming] Guangdong Univ Petrochem Technol, Coll Mat Sci & Technol, Maoming, Peoples R China",,"Zhang, JC (corresponding author), Nanjing Forestry Univ, Jiangsu Prov Key Lab Soil & Water Conservat & Eco, Coinnovat Ctr Sustainable Forestry Southern China, Nanjing, Peoples R China.",zhang8811@njfu.edu.cn,,,Priority Academic Program Development of Jiangsu Higher Education Institutions (PAPD); National Foundation of Forestry Science and Technology Popularization [[2015]17]; Major Fund for Natural Science of Jiangsu Higher Education Institutions [15KJA220004],"This project was funded by the Priority Academic Program Development of Jiangsu Higher Education Institutions (PAPD), National Foundation of Forestry Science and Technology Popularization (grant no.

Despite the crucial role of ocean inflow in the climate system, less is known about its predictability, variability, and connectivity to cryospheric and climatic patterns on different time scales. In this study, multi-scale variation modes were decomposed from observed daily and monthly snowcover and river flows to improve the predictability of Arctic Ocean inflows from the Mackenzie River Basin in Canada. Two multi-linear regression and Bayesian neural network models were used with different combinations of remotely sensed snowcover, in-situ inflow observations, and climatic teleconnection patterns as predictors. The results showed that daily and monthly ocean inflows are associated positively with decadal snowcover fluctuations and negatively with interannual snowcover fluctuations. Interannual snowcover and antecedent flow oscillations have a more important role in describing the variability of ocean inflows than seasonal snowmelt and large-scale climatic teleconnection. Both models forecasted inflows seven months in advance with a Nash-Sutcliffe efficiency score of approximate to 0.8. The proposed methodology can be used to assess the variability of the freshwater input to northern oceans, affecting thermohaline and atmospheric circulations.","[Rasouli, Kabir] Environm & Climate Change Canada, Meteorol Serv Canada, 2121 Trans Canada Route, Dorval, PQ H9P 1J3, Canada; [Rasouli, Kabir] Univ Calgary, Dept Geosci, Calgary, AB, Canada; [Nasri, Bouchra R.] McGill Univ, GERAD, Montreal, PQ, Canada; [Nasri, Bouchra R.] McGill Univ, Dept Math & Stat, Montreal, PQ, Canada; [Soleymani, Armina] Univ Waterloo, Dept Syst Design Engn, Waterloo, ON, Canada; [Mahmood, Taufique H.] Univ North Dakota, Sch Geol & Geol Engn, Harold Hamm, Grand Forks, ND USA; [Hori, Masahiro] Japan Aerosp Explorat Agcy, Earth Observat Res Ctr, Chofu, Tokyo, Japan; [Haghighi, Ali Torabi] Univ Oulu, Water Energy & Environm Engn Res Unit, Oulu, Finland",,"Rasouli, K (corresponding author), Environm & Climate Change Canada, Meteorol Serv Canada, 2121 Trans Canada Route, Dorval, PQ H9P 1J3, Canada.; Rasouli, K (corresponding author), Univ Calgary, Dept Geosci, Calgary, AB, Canada.",kabir.rasouli@usask.ca,"Mahmood, Taufique/ABB-8369-2020; Rasouli, Kabir/AAN-7404-2021; Haghighi, Ali Torabi/AAE-6862-2021",", Masahiro/0000-0002-9729-7909; Rasouli, Kabir/0000-0002-8176-2132; Nasri, Bouchra R./0000-0001-6334-3105; Mahmood, Taufique/0000-0003-1198-9603",Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada (NSERC)Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada (NSERC); NSFNational Science Foundation (NSF) [IIA-135466]; Fonds de recherche du Quebec-Nature et technologies; Canadian Statistical Sciences Institute,"The authors gratefully acknowledge the financial support from the Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada (NSERC) through Post-doctoral Fellowship to KR, NSF funded ND EPSCoR (NSF grant #IIA-135466) to THM and from the Fonds de recherche du Quebec-Nature et technologies and the Canadian Statistical Sciences Institute through Post-doctoral Fellowship to BRN.

Flash floods need to be predicted over a wide range with long forecasting lead time for effective evacuation. The predictability of flash floods caused by the two extreme events is investigated by using a high-resolution (similar to 150 m) nationwide distributed rainfall-runoff model forced by ensemble precipitation forecasts with 39 h lead time. Results of the deterministic simulation at nowcasting mode with radar and gauge composite rainfall could reasonably simulate the storm runoff hydrographs at many dam reservoirs over western Japan for the case of heavy rainfall in 2018 (F18) with the default parameter setting. For the case of Typhoon Hagibis in 2019 (T19), a similar performance was obtained by incorporating unsaturated flow effect in the model applied to Kanto Region. The performance of the ensemble forecast was evaluated based on the bias ratios and the relative operating characteristic curves, which suggested the higher predictability in peak runoff for T19. For the F18, the uncertainty arises due to the difficulty in accurately forecasting the storm positions by the frontal zone; as a result, the actual distribution of the peak runoff could not be well forecasted. Overall, this study showed that the predictability of flash floods was different between the two extreme events. The ensemble spreads contain quantitative information of predictive uncertainty, which can be utilized for the decision making of emergency responses against flash floods.","[Sayama, Takahiro; Yamada, Masafumi] Kyoto Univ, Disaster Prevent Res Inst, Uji, Kyoto 6110011, Japan; [Sugawara, Yoshito] Kyoto Univ, Grad Sch Engn, Nishikyo Ku, Kyoto 6158530, Japan; [Yamazaki, Dai] Univ Tokyo, Inst Ind Sci, Meguro Ku, 4-6-1 Komaba, Tokyo 1538505, Japan",,"Sayama, T (corresponding author), Kyoto Univ, Disaster Prevent Res Inst, Uji, Kyoto 6110011, Japan.",sayama.takahiro.3u@kyoto-u.ac.jp,"Yamazaki, Dai/J-3029-2012","Yamazaki, Dai/0000-0002-6478-1841; YAMADA, Masafumi/0000-0002-5718-9233","Cabinet Office, Government of Japan, Cross-ministerial Strategic Innovation Promotion Program (SIP), Enhancement of Societal Resiliency against Natural Disasters; JSPS KAKENHIMinistry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology, Japan (MEXT)Japan Society for the Promotion of ScienceGrants-in-Aid for Scientific Research (KAKENHI) [19H02248, 19K24678]","This work was supported by Cabinet Office, Government of Japan, Cross-ministerial Strategic Innovation Promotion Program (SIP), Enhancement of Societal Resiliency against Natural Disasters (PI: Prof. Hori) and JSPS KAKENHI Grant Number 19H02248 (PI: Sayama) and 19K24678 (PI: Prof. Nihei).",,60,7,7,2,7,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"ONE NEW YORK PLAZA, SUITE 4600, NEW YORK, NY, UNITED STATES",2197-4284,,,PROG EARTH PLANET SC,Prog.

We evaluated the importance of current groundwater levels, precipitation, streamflow, seasonal variability, Palmer Drought Severity Index, and atmosphere/ocean indices for developing the logistic regression equations. Several diagnostics of model fit were used to evaluate the regression equations, including testing of autocorrelation of residuals, goodness-of-fit metrics, and bootstrap validation testing. The probabilistic predictions were most successful at wells with high persistence (low month-to-month variability) in their groundwater records and at wells where the groundwater level remained below the defined low threshold for sustained periods (generally three months or longer). The model fit was weakest at wells with strong seasonal variability in levels and with shorter duration low-threshold events.

In the face of limited time and resources, scientists, resource managers, and policy makers need ways to rank stressors and their impacts so that we can prioritize them from the most to least important (i.e., perform 'ecological triage'). We report results from an experiment in which we established a periphyton community from the Huron River (Michigan, USA) in 84 experimental 'flumes' (stream mesocosms). We then dosed the flumes with gradients of six common stressors (increased temperature, taxa extinctions, sedimentation, nitrogen, phosphorus, and road salt) and monitored periphyton structure and function. A set of a priori deterministic functions were fit to each stressor-endpoint response and model averaging based on AICc weights was used to develop concentration-response best-fit predictions. Model predictions from different stressors were then compared to forecasts of future environmental change to rank stressors according to the potential magnitude of impacts. All of the stressors studied altered at least one characteristic of the periphyton; however, the extent (i.e., structural and functional changes) and magnitude of effects expected under future forecasts differed significantly among stressors. Elevated nitrogen concentrations are projected to have the greatest combined effect on stream periphyton structure and function. Extinction, sediment, and phosphorus all had similar but less substantial impact on the periphyton (e.g., affected only structure not function, smaller magnitude change). Elevated temperature and salt both had measurable effects on periphyton, but their overall impacts were much lower than any of the other stressors. For periphyton in the Huron River, our results suggest that, among the stressors examined, increased N pollution may have the greatest potential to alter the structure and function of the periphyton community, and managers should prioritize reducing anthropogenic sources of nitrogen. Our study demonstrates an experimental approach to ecological triage that can be used as an additional line of evidence to prioritize management decisions for specific ecosystems in the face of ecological change.","[Costello, David M.; Kulacki, Konrad J.; McCarthy, Mary E.; Cardinale, Bradley J.] Univ Michigan, Sch Environm & Sustainabil, Ann Arbor, MI 48109 USA; [Costello, David M.] Kent State Univ, Dept Biol Sci, Kent, OH 44242 USA; [Kulacki, Konrad J.] Exponent, Maynard, MA USA; [Tiegs, Scott D.] Oakland Univ, Dept Biol Sci, Rochester, MI USA",,"Costello, DM (corresponding author), Univ Michigan, Sch Environm & Sustainabil, Ann Arbor, MI 48109 USA.; Costello, DM (corresponding author), Kent State Univ, Dept Biol Sci, Kent, OH 44242 USA.",dcostel3@kent.edu,"Cardinale, Bradley J/I-7076-2013; Costello, David M/A-2694-2010","Costello, David M/0000-0002-1532-5399","U.S. National Science FoundationNational Science Foundation (NSF) [DEB-0842009, NSF-1046121]","This work was funded by U.S. National Science Foundation (https://www.nsf.org/) grants to BJC (DEB-0842009 and NSF-1046121).

These closures can have serious consequences for fishers and fishing communities, and have necessitated the release of millions of dollars of federal disaster aid. The 2017 ocean Chinook troll fishery (the major salmon ocean fishery) is closed between southern Oregon and northern California to protect the Klamath River fall Chinook, which is forecast to return in low numbers. A model of vessel fishing choices was used in combination with an established input-output model to estimate the potential economic impact of this closure on fishers and fishing communities. The analysis predicts that this closure of the ocean fishery will result in a loss of $5.8-$8.9 million in income, $12.8-$19.6 million in sales, and 200-330 jobs. These estimates are only a partial estimate of the economic impacts of the 2017 salmon regulations, as they do not fully account for the effects of the limited season outside of the closed ocean area or the effects on other salmon fisheries (e.g. the gillnet and recreational fisheries). The impacts are not distributed evenly in space, with the largest relative losses occurring in the Coos Bay, Brookings, and Eureka regions. This information may be useful as policymakers consider mitigating economic losses in the fishery and associated communities. Early estimates of economic impacts of fishery closures may also enable quicker determination of the need and extent of disaster assistance and a more timely response.","[Richerson, Kate] NOAA Fisheries, Northwest Fisheries Sci Ctr, 2725 Montlake Blvd E, Seattle, WA 98112 USA; [Richerson, Kate] Univ Washington, Sch Aquat & Fishery Sci, 1122 NE Boat St, Seattle, WA 98105 USA; [Leonard, Jerry] NOAA Fisheries, Fishery Resource Anal & Monitoring Div, Northwest Fisheries Sci Ctr, 2725 Montlake Blvd E, Seattle, WA 98112 USA; [Holland, Daniel S.] NOAA Fisheries, Conservat Biol Div, Northwest Fisheries Sci Ctr, 2725 Montlake Blvd E, Seattle, WA 98112 USA",,"Richerson, K (corresponding author), Univ Washington, Sch Aquat & Fishery Sci, 1122 NE Boat St, Seattle, WA 98105 USA.",katericherson@gmail.com,,,National Oceanic and Atmospheric AdministrationNational Oceanic Atmospheric Admin (NOAA) - USA; Joint Institute for the Study of the Atmosphere and Ocean [NA15OAR4320063]; National Science FoundationNational Science Foundation (NSF) [1616821],"This work was funded by the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, the Joint Institute for the Study of the Atmosphere and Ocean (NA15OAR4320063), and the National Science Foundation (grant number 1616821).

As a typical non-stationary time series, it is difficult to avoid the effects of noise in the hydrological data. In this study, the wavelet threshold de-noising method was applied to pre-process daily flow data from a small forested basin. The key factors influencing the de-noising results, such as the mother wavelet type, decomposition level, and threshold functions, were examined and determined according to the signal to noise ratio and mean square error. Then, three mathematical techniques, including an optimized back-propagation neural network (BPNN), optimized support vector regression (SVR), and adaptive neuro-fuzzy inference system (ANFIS), were used to predict the daily streamflow based on raw data and wavelet de-noising data. The performance of the three models indicated that a wavelet de-noised time series could improve the forecasting accuracy. The SVR showed a better overall performance than BPNN and ANFIS during both the training and validating periods. However, the estimation of low flow and peak flow indicated that ANFIS performed best in the prediction of low flow and that SVR was slightly superior to the others for forecasting peak flow.","[Li, Xue; Sha, Jian; Wang, Zhong-Liang] Tianjin Normal Univ, Tianjin Key Lab Water Resources & Environm, Tianjin 300387, Peoples R China; [Li, You-meng] Tianjin Univ, Sch Comp Software, Tianjin 300350, Peoples R China",,"Wang, ZL (corresponding author), Tianjin Normal Univ, Tianjin Key Lab Water Resources & Environm, Tianjin 300387, Peoples R China.",wangzhongliang@vip.skleg.cn,,,Technology Research and Development Program of the Higher Education Institutions of Tianjin [043135202JW1716]; innovation team training plan of the Tianjin Education Committee [TD12-5037]; National Natural Science Foundation of ChinaNational Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC) [41372373],"This work is supported by the Technology Research and Development Program of the Higher Education Institutions of Tianjin (043135202JW1716), the innovation team training plan of the Tianjin Education Committee (TD12-5037) and National Natural Science Foundation of China (No. 41372373).

The hindcasts were produced with WUSHP (Wageningen University Seamless Hydrological Prediction system). Skill was identified in a companion paper. In WUSHP, hydrological processes are simulated by running the Variable Infiltration Capacity (VIC) hydrological model forced with an ensemble of bias-corrected output from the seasonal forecast system 4 (S4) of the European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts (ECMWF). We first analysed the meteorological forcing. The precipitation forecasts contain considerable skill for the first lead month but hardly any significant skill at longer lead times. Seasonal forecasts of temperature have more skill. Skill in summer temperature is related to climate change and is more or less independent of lead time. Skill in February and March is unrelated to climate change. Different sources of skill in hydro-meteorological variables were isolated with a suite of specific hydrological hindcasts akin to ensemble streamflow prediction (ESP). These hindcasts show that in Europe, initial conditions of soil moisture (SM) form the dominant source of skill in run-off. From April to July, initial conditions of snow contribute significantly to the skill. Some remarkable skill features are due to indirect effects, i.e. skill due to forcing or initial conditions of snow and soil moisture at an earlier stage is stored in the hydrological state (snow and/or soil moisture) of a later stage, which then contributes to persistence of skill. Skill in evapotranspiration (ET) originates mostly in the meteorological forcing. For run-off we also compared the full hindcasts (with S4 forcing) with two types of ESP (or ESP-like) hindcasts (with identical forcing for all years). Beyond the second lead month, the full hindcasts are less skilful than the ESP (or ESP-like) hindcasts, because inter-annual variations in the S4 forcing consist mainly of noise which enhances degradation of the skill.","[Greuell, Wouter; Franssen, Wietse H.

Where established, starry stonewort can interfere with recreational uses of water bodies and potentially have ecological impacts. Incipient invasion of starry stonewort in Minnesota provides an opportunity to predict future expansion in order to target early detection and strategic management. We used ecological niche models to identify suitable areas for starry stonewort in Minnesota based on global occurrence records and present-day and future climate conditions. We assessed sensitivity of forecasts to different parameters, using four emission scenarios (i.e., RCP 2.6, RCP 4.5, RCP 6, and RCP 8.5) from five future climate models (i.e., CCSM, GISS, IPSL, MIROC, and MRI). From our niche model analyses, we found that (i) occurrences from the entire range, instead of occurrences restricted to the invaded range, provide more informed models; (ii) default settings in Maxent did not provide the best model; (iii) the model calibration area and its background samples impact model performance; (iv) model projections to future climate conditions should be restricted to analogous environments; and (v) forecasts in future climate conditions should include different future climate models and model calibration areas to better capture uncertainty in forecasts. Under present climate, the most suitable areas for starry stonewort are predicted to be found in central and southeastern Minnesota. In the future, suitable areas for starry stonewort are predicted to shift in geographic range under some future climate models and to shrink under others, with most permutations indicating a net decrease of the species' suitable range. Our suitability maps can serve to design shortterm plans for surveillance and education, while future climate models suggest a plausible reduction of starry stonewort spread in the long-term if the trends in climate warming remain.","[Romero-Alvarez, Daniel] Hosp Gen Enrique Garces, Unidad Epidemiol, Quito, Ecuador; [Escobar, Luis E.; Larkin, Daniel J.; Phelps, Nicholas B.

Additionally, hydrologic modeling using high-resolution spatial and temporal data is used to simulate the land surface water and energy fluxes, including runoff, baseflow, and soil moisture, which are useful for drought forecasting. In this study, the Soil and Water Assessment Tool (SWAT) and Variable Infiltration Capacity (VIC) models are used for short-term drought forecasting in the contiguous United States (CONUS), as many areas in this region are frequently affected by varying drought intensities. Weekly-to-seasonal meteorological inputs are provided by the Climate Prediction Center (CPC) for the retrospective period (January 2012 to July 2017) and Climate Forecasting System version 2 (CFS v2) for the forecasting period (August 2017 to April 2018), and these inputs are used to estimate agricultural and groundwater drought conditions. For drought assessment, three drought indices, namely, the Standardized Soil Moisture index (SSI), the Multivariate Standardized Drought Index (MSDI), and the Standardized Baseflow index (SBI), were analyzed. The accuracy of the forecasting results was verified using several a performance measure (Drought area agreement (%); DA). Generally, eight weeks of lead time forecasting showed good drought predictability from both the SWAT and VIC models for the MSDI simulations (62% for SWAT and 64% for VIC for all drought categories). However, the DA values for eight weeks lead time forecasting for SSI were 23% (SWAT) and 10% (VIC) and 7% (SWAT) and 7% (VIC) for the SBI, respectively. In addition, the accuracies of drought predictions remarkably decreased after eight weeks, and the average DA values were 36% for SWAT and 38% for VIC due to an increase in the uncertainties associated with meteorological variables in CFS v2 products. For example, there are increases in the total number of grids where the absolute values of monthly differences between CFSv2 and CPC observations exceed 20 mm and 1 degrees C during the forecasting period. Additionally, drought forecasting using only one variable (i.e., SSI and SBI) showed low prediction performances even for the first eight weeks. The results of this study provide insights into drought forecasting methods and provide a better understanding to plan for timely water resource management decisions.","[Kang, Hyunwoo; Sridhar, Venkataramana] Virginia Polytech Inst & State Univ, Dept Biol Syst Engn, Blacksburg, VA 24061 USA",,"Sridhar, V (corresponding author), Virginia Polytech Inst & State Univ, Dept Biol Syst Engn, Blacksburg, VA 24061 USA.",hwkang@vt.edu; vsri@vt.edu,"Kang, Hyunwoo/ABA-4820-2021; Sridhar, Venkat/AAT-6676-2020","Sridhar, Venkat/0000-0002-1003-2247","Virginia Agricultural Experiment Station (Blacksburg); Hatch Program of the National Institute of Food and Agriculture, U.S Department of Agriculture (Washington, D.C.); Institute for Critical Technology and Applied Science (ICTAS), Graduate School at Virginia Tech","This project was funded, in part, by the Virginia Agricultural Experiment Station (Blacksburg) and the Hatch Program of the National Institute of Food and Agriculture, U.S Department of Agriculture (Washington, D.C.).

A reliable forecast of seasonal water availability for the Kharif cropping season (April-September) can pave the way towards better water management and a subsequent boost in the agro-economy of Pakistan. The use of degree-day models in conjunction with satellite-based remote-sensing data for the forecasting of seasonal snow and ice melt runoff has proved to be a suitable approach for data-scarce regions. In the present research, the Snowmelt Runoff Model (SRM) has not only been enhanced by incorporating the glacier (G) component but also applied for the forecast of seasonal water availability from the Upper Indus Basin (UIB). Excelbased SRM + G takes account of separate degree-day factors for snow and glacier melt processes. All-year simulation runs with SRM + G for the period 2003-2014 result in an average flow component distribution of 53, 21, and 26% for snow, glacier, and rain, respectively. The UIB has been divided into Upper and Lower parts because of the different climatic conditions in the Tibetan Plateau. The scenario approach for seasonal forecasting, which like the Ensemble Streamflow Prediction method uses historic meteorology as model forcings, has proven to be adequate for long-term water availability forecasts. The accuracy of the forecast with a mean absolute percentage error (MAPE) of 9.5% could be slightly improved compared to two existing operational forecasts for the UIB, and the bias could be reduced to 2.0 %. However, the association between forecasts and observations as well as the skill in predicting extreme conditions is rather weak for all three models, which motivates further research on the selection of a subset of ensemble members according to forecasted seasonal anomalies.","[Ismail, Muhammad Fraz] Tech Univ Munich, Dept Civil Geo & Environm Engn, Munich, Germany; [Ismail, Muhammad Fraz; Bogacki, Wolfgang] Koblenz Univ Appl Sci, Dept Civil Engn, Koblenz, Germany",,"Bogacki, W (corresponding author), Koblenz Univ Appl Sci, Dept Civil Engn, Koblenz, Germany.",bogacki@hs-koblenz.de,"Ismail, Muhammad Fraz/N-3546-2019",,,,,47,5,6,1,7,COPERNICUS GESELLSCHAFT MBH,GOTTINGEN,"BAHNHOFSALLEE 1E, GOTTINGEN, 37081, GERMANY",1027-5606,1607-7938,,HYDROL EARTH SYST SC,Hydrol.

The proposed forecasting method was tested for the Ho Ho reservoir, the area facing the scarcity of historical data for model calibration and verification. The analysis of the forecasting results for Ho Ho reservoir using transferred parameters from the stable calibrated parameter values at Hoa Duyet station (downstream of Ho Ho reservoir) and the results obtained using the adapted parameters by the proposed method shows that the adapted parameter values provides a more reliable forecast, which will better serve the decision making.","[Dang Dinh Kha; Nhu, Nguyen Y.; Tran Ngoc Anh] Vietnam Natl Univ, VNU Univ Sci, Dept Hydrol & Water Resources, 334 Nguyen Trai, Hanoi, Vietnam; [Tran Ngoc Anh] Vietnam Natl Univ, VNU Univ Sci, Ctr Environm Fluid Dynam, Hanoi, Vietnam",,"Kha, DD (corresponding author), Vietnam Natl Univ, VNU Univ Sci, Dept Hydrol & Water Resources, 334 Nguyen Trai, Hanoi, Vietnam.",dangdinhkha@hus.edu.vn,,"Dang, Kha/0000-0003-3884-9387",VNU University of Science [TN. 17.16],This research is funded by the VNU University of Science under project number TN. 17.16.,,13,4,5,0,0,POLISH SOC ECOLOGICAL ENGINEERING,LUBLIN,"LUBLIN UNIV TECHNOLOGY, ENVIRONMENTAL ENGINEERING FAC, LUBLIN, 20618, POLAND",2299-8993,,,J ECOL ENG,J.

Dams along the river help to manage flood waters, and are important sources of electricity for the region. Being able to forecast high-impact events at long lead times therefore has enormous potential benefit. Recent improvements in seasonal forecasting mean that dynamical climate models can start to be used directly for operational services. The teleconnection from El Nio to Yangtze River basin rainfall meant that the strong El Nio in winter 2015/16 provided a valuable opportunity to test the application of a dynamical forecast system. This paper therefore presents a case study of a real-time seasonal forecast for the Yangtze River basin, building on previous work demonstrating the retrospective skill of such a forecast. A simple forecasting methodology is presented, in which the forecast probabilities are derived from the historical relationship between hindcast and observations. Its performance for 2016 is discussed. The heavy rainfall in the May-June-July period was correctly forecast well in advance. August saw anomalously low rainfall, and the forecasts for the June-July-August period correctly showed closer to average levels. The forecasts contributed to the confidence of decision-makers across the Yangtze River basin. Trials of climate services such as this help to promote appropriate use of seasonal forecasts, and highlight areas for future improvements.","[Bett, Philip E.; Scaife, Adam A.; Hewitt, Chris; Golding, Nicola; Dunstone, Nick; Smith, Doug M.; Thornton, Hazel E.] Met Off, Hadley Ctr, FitzRoy Rd, Exeter EX1 3PB, Devon, England; [Scaife, Adam A.] Univ Exeter, Coll Engn Math & Phys Sci, Exeter EX4 4QF, Devon, England; [Li, Chaofan] Chinese Acad Sci, Inst Atmospher Phys, Ctr Monsoon Syst Res, Beijing 100029, Peoples R China; [Zhang, Peiqun; Ren, Hong-Li] China Meteorol Adm, Natl Climate Ctr, Lab Climate Studies, Beijing 100081, Peoples R China; [Lu, Riyu] Chinese Acad Sci, Inst Atmospher Phys, State Key Lab Numer Modeling Atmospher Sci & Geop, Beijing 100029, Peoples R China",,"Bett, PE (corresponding author), Met Off, Hadley Ctr, FitzRoy Rd, Exeter EX1 3PB, Devon, England.",philip.bett@metoffice.gov.uk,"Smith, Doug/ABD-5204-2021; Zhang, Peiqun/AAQ-5385-2020; Bett, Philip E/I-2682-2012; Ren, Hong-Li/X-9632-2018; Li, Chaofan/D-2735-2017","Bett, Philip E/0000-0002-4508-7192; Ren, Hong-Li/0000-0001-7194-0567; Li, Chaofan/0000-0001-5157-5427; Hewitt, Chris/0000-0002-4718-4009","UK-China Research & Innovation Partnership Fund through the Met Office Climate Science for Service Partnership China, Newton Fund; National Natural Science Foundation of ChinaNational Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC) [41320104007]; Project for Development of Key Techniques in Meteorological Operation Forecasting [YBGJXM201705]","This work and its contributors (PB, AS, ND, DS, CH, NG) were supported by the UK-China Research & Innovation Partnership Fund through the Met Office Climate Science for Service Partnership China as part of the Newton Fund.

In the proposed method, the VMD method is first used to decompose the original streamflow into a series of disjoint subcomponents; second, each subcomponent is forecasted by constructing an appropriate extreme learning machine model while the gravitational search algorithm is adopted to tune the model parameters; finally, the aggregated output generated by the forecasting results of all the models is treated as the final simulated output. The annual runoff data series of three huge hydropower reservoirs in China are chosen to testify the performance of the proposed forecasting model. The results show that the developed model can outperform several traditional methods with respect to the employed statistical indexes.

The information, especially concerning runoff, is however rarely available for the calibration of the hydrological models used. Therefore, a method is presented to derive local runoff from secondary information for the calibration of the model parameters of the rainfallrunoff model COSERO. Changes in water levels in reservoirs, reservoir outflows, discharge measurements at water intakes and in transport lines are thereby used to derive the local, natural flow for a given sub-catchment. The proposed method is applied within a research study for the A-BB Infrastructure Railsystem division in the Stubache catchment in the central Austrian Alps. Here, the A-BB operates the hydropower scheme Kraftwerksgruppe Stubachtal, which consists of 7 reservoirs and 4 hydropower stations. The hydrological model has been set up considering this human influences and the high natural heterogeneity in topography and land cover, including glaciers. Overall, the hydrological model performs mostly well for the catchment with highest NSE values of 0.78 for the calibration and 0.79 for the validation period, also considering the use of homogeneous parameter fields and the uncertainty of the derived local discharge values. The derived runoff data proved to be useful information for the model calibration. Further analysis, examining the water balance and its components as well as snow cover, showed satisfactory simulation results. In conclusion, a unique runoff dataset for a small scale high-alpine catchment has been created to establish a hydrological flow prediction model which in a further step can be used for improved and sustainable hydropower management.","[Herrnegger, Mathew] Inst Water Management Hydrol & Hydraul Engn IWHW, Muthgasse 18, A-1190 Vienna, Austria; Univ Nat Resources & Life Sci, Vienna BOKU, Muthgasse 18, A-1190 Vienna, Austria",,"Herrnegger, M (corresponding author), Inst Water Management Hydrol & Hydraul Engn IWHW, Muthgasse 18, A-1190 Vienna, Austria.",johannes.wesemann@boku.ac.at; mathew.herrnegger@boku.ac.at; karsten.schulz@boku.ac.at,"Herrnegger, Mathew/ABA-6465-2021","Herrnegger, Mathew/0000-0002-5388-2831; Schulz, Karsten/0000-0002-6616-2876",OBB Infrastructure,"This study was funded by the OBB Infrastructure.

Accurate forecasting of streamflow always being a challenging task for the hydrologist due to its high stochasticity and dynamic patterns. Several traditional and the deep learning models have been applied to simulate the complex nature of the hydrological system. However, to develop and explore a better expert system for prediction is a continuous exertion for hydrological studies. In this study, a deep neural network, namely a one-dimensional convolutional neural network (1D-CNN) and extreme learning machine (ELM) are explored for one-step-ahead streamflow forecasting for three-time horizons (daily, weekly and monthly) in Gilgit River, Pakistan. The 1D-CNN model gained incredible popularity due to its state-of-the-art performance and nominal computational complexity; while ELM model performed superfast as compared to traditional/deep learning architecture, gives comparable performance with fast execution rate. A comparative analysis is presented to assess the performance of the 1D-CNN related to the ELM model. The performance measurement matrices defined as the correlation coefficient (R-2), mean absolute error (MAE) and root mean square error (RMSE) computed between the observed and predicted streamflow to evaluate the 1D-CNN and ELM model efficacy. The results indicated that the ELM model performed relatively better than the 1D-CNN model based on predefined statistical measures in three-time scale. In numerical terms, the superiority of ELM over 1D-CNN model was demonstrated by R-2 = 0.99, MAE = 18.8, RMSE = 50.14, and R-2 = 0.97, MAE = 136.59, RMSE = 230.9, for daily streamflow (testing phase) respectively. Based on our findings, it can be concluded that the ELM model would be an alternative to the 1D-CNN model for highly accurate streamflow forecasting in mountainous regions of the world.","[Hussain, Dostdar] Natl Cheng Kung Univ, Dept Geomat, 1 Univ Rd, Tainan 70101, Taiwan; [Hussain, Dostdar; Khan, Aftab Ahmed] Karakuram Int Univ, Dept Comp Sci, Gilgit 15100, Pakistan; [Hussain, Tahir] Natl Cheng Kung Univ, Dept Comp Sci & Commun Engn, 1 Univ Rd, Tainan 70101, Taiwan; [Naqvi, Syed Ali Asad] Govt Coll Univ, Dept Geog, Faisalabad 38000, Pakistan; [Jamil, Akhtar] Istanbul Sabahattin Zaim Univ, Dept Comp Engn, TR-34303 Istanbul, Turkey",,"Hussain, D (corresponding author), Natl Cheng Kung Univ, Dept Geomat, 1 Univ Rd, Tainan 70101, Taiwan.; Hussain, D; Khan, AA (corresponding author), Karakuram Int Univ, Dept Comp Sci, Gilgit 15100, Pakistan.",dostdar.hussain@kiu.edu.pk; q36087068@gs.ncku.edu.tw; aftab.ahmed@kiu.edu.pk; draliasad@gcuf.edu.pk; akhtar.jamil@izu.edu.tr,"JAMIL, AKHTAR/M-6215-2019; Naqvi, Syed Ali Asad/ABD-1045-2021; Naqvi, Syed Ali Asad/ABD-5896-2021","JAMIL, AKHTAR/0000-0002-2592-1039; Naqvi, Syed Ali Asad/0000-0001-6497-9375; Naqvi, Syed Ali Asad/0000-0001-6497-9375",,,,42,10,10,9,25,SPRINGER HEIDELBERG,HEIDELBERG,"TIERGARTENSTRASSE 17, D-69121 HEIDELBERG, GERMANY",1865-0473,1865-0481,,EARTH SCI INFORM,Earth Sci.

This study developed a stepwise and dynamic C-vine copula-based conditional model (SDCVC) to incorporate the nonstationarity into a monthly streamflow prediction, which depicted the predictor-predictand association on the basis of monthly streamflow and rainfall series of upstream and downstream stations in the Yangtze River basin of China. The model consists of (1) nonstationary modeling of the margins and nonstationary temporal and spatial dependence structure by the generalized additive models with location, scale, and shape (GAMLSS) and C-vine copula incorporating climate-related indexes as covariates during training time frames; and (2) a four-dimensional C-vine copula-based conditional quantile function to generate the simulated series during validation time frames. Three kinds of nonstationary models corresponding to different degrees were investigated to show the impact of nonstationarity on the streamflow forecasting. The proposed SDCVC model considering highest degree of nonstationarity outperformed the other two nonstationary models in terms of the performance metrics, because the SDCVC model not only described the dynamic change of time-varying connections between parameter and the large-scale climate forcings, but the stepwise strategy, by selecting the optimum time horizon, helped increase forecasting accuracy. Furthermore, the SDCVC model is superior, to some extent, to classical data-driven approaches [support vector regression (SVR) and adaptive-network-based fuzzy inference system (ANFIS)] in terms of the performance metrics.","[Xu, Pengcheng] Minist Water Resources, Key Lab Water Sci & Engn, Nanjing 210029, Peoples R China; [Xu, Pengcheng] Yangzhou Univ, Coll Hydraul Sci & Engn, Yangzhou 225009, Jiangsu, Peoples R China; [Wang, Dong] Nanjing Univ, State Key Lab Pollut Control & Resource Reuse, Dept Hydrosci, Minist Educ,Sch Earth Sci & Engn,Key Lab Surficia, Nanjing 210023, Peoples R China; [Wang, Yuankun] North China Elect Power Univ, Sch Water Resources & Hydropower Engn, Beijing 102206, Peoples R China; [Singh, Vijay P.] Texas A&M Univ, Dept Biol & Agr Engn, Zachry Dept Civil & Environm Engn, College Stn, TX 77843 USA; [Singh, Vijay P.] UAE Univ, Natl Water & Energy Ctr, Al Ain, U Arab Emirates",,"Xu, PC (corresponding author), Minist Water Resources, Key Lab Water Sci & Engn, Nanjing 210029, Peoples R China.; Xu, PC (corresponding author), Yangzhou Univ, Coll Hydraul Sci & Engn, Yangzhou 225009, Jiangsu, Peoples R China.",m18994113495@163.com,,"Xu, Pengcheng/0000-0002-2055-7506","Open Fund of the Key Laboratory of Water Science and Engineering, Ministry of Water Resources [2021100108]; National Key Research and Development Program of China [2017YFC1502704]; Jiangsu Graduate Research and Practice Innovation Program [KYCX21_0059]","Streamflow data are from the Bureau of Hydrology, Ministry of Water Resources, China.

In Ireland, no such service exists to deliver forecasts at the catchment scale. In order to understand the potential for hydrological forecasting in Ireland, we benchmark the skill of ensemble streamflow prediction (ESP) for a diverse sample of 46 catchments using the GR4J (Genie Rural a 4 parametres Journalier) hydrological model. Skill is evaluated within a 52-year hindcast study design over lead times of 1 d to 12 months for each of the 12 initialisation months, January to December. Our results show that ESP is skilful against a probabilistic climatology benchmark in the majority of catchments up to several months ahead. However, the level of skill was strongly dependent on lead time, initialisation month, and individual catchment location and storage properties. Mean ESP skill was found to decay rapidly as a function of lead time, with a continuous ranked probability skill score (CRPSS) of 0.8 (1 d), 0.32 (2-week), 0.18 (1-month), 0.05 (3-month), and 0.01 (12-month). Forecasts were generally more skilful when initialised in summer than other seasons. A strong correlation (rho = 0.94) was observed between forecast skill and catchment storage capacity (baseflow index), with the most skilful regions, the Midlands and the East, being those where slowly responding, high-storage catchments are located. Forecast reliability and discrimination were also assessed with respect to low- and high-flow events. In addition to our benchmarking experiment, we conditioned ESP with the winter North Atlantic Oscillation (NAO) using adjusted hindcasts from the Met Office's Global Seasonal Forecasting System version 5. We found gains in winter forecast skill (CRPSS) of 7 %-18% were possible over lead times of 1 to 3 months and that improved reliability and discrimination make NAO-conditioned ESP particularly effective at forecasting dry winters, a critical season for water resources management. We conclude that ESP is skilful in a number of different contexts and thus should be operationalised in Ireland given its potential benefits for water managers and other stakeholders.","[Donegan, Sean; Murphy, Conor; Quinn, Daire Foran; Golian, Saeed] Maynooth Univ, Dept Geog, Irish Climate Anal & Res UnitS ICARUS, Maynooth, Kildare, Ireland; [Harrigan, Shaun; Prudhomme, Christel] European Ctr Medium Range Weather Forecasts ECMWF, Forecast Dept, Reading, Berks, England; [Broderick, Ciaran] Met Eireann, Flood Forecasting Div, Dublin 9, Ireland; [Knight, Jeff; Scaife, Adam A.; Stringer, Nicky] Met Off Hadley Ctr, Exeter, Devon, England; [Matthews, Tom; Prudhomme, Christel; Wilby, Robert L.] Loughborough Univ, Dept Geog & Environm, Loughborough, Leics, England; [Prudhomme, Christel] UK Ctr Ecol & Hydrol UKCEH, Wallingford, Oxon, England; [Scaife, Adam A.] Univ Exeter, Coll Engn Math & Phys Sci, Exeter, Devon, England",,"Donegan, S (corresponding author), Maynooth Univ, Dept Geog, Irish Climate Anal & Res UnitS ICARUS, Maynooth, Kildare, Ireland.",sean.donegan@mu.ie,"Prudhomme, Christel/K-2669-2012; Harrigan, Shaun/C-9370-2014; Golian, Saeed/D-3611-2018","Prudhomme, Christel/0000-0003-1722-2497; Donegan, Sean/0000-0002-5957-2201; Harrigan, Shaun/0000-0002-0992-3667; Golian, Saeed/0000-0001-5451-3977",Science Foundation IrelandScience Foundation IrelandEuropean Commission [SFI/17/CDA/4783],This research has been supported by Science Foundation Ireland (grant no.

How to make an objective combination for the predictive results of precipitation? Information fusion in data assimilation is introduced to merge the improved National Centers for Environmental Prediction coupled forecast system model version 2 (CFSv2) with the multilinear regression model. Firstly, in terms of time, the annual precipitation is apt to decline at most stations within 30 years, and precipitation mainly concentrates in the flood season. The characteristics of spatial distribution are similar to topographic features. It can also be found that precipitation gradually decreases from south to north. Secondly, from statistical forecasting, the relationship between precipitation and global sea surface temperature (SST) is explored. Prediction equation is established with SST and the average precipitation. Thirdly, from dynamic model forecasting, the CFSv2 original model and the CFSv2 statistical downscaling model are used to analyze the influence of model deviation on fusion prediction. The optimum interpolation assimilation method is applied for realizing the optimal integration of statistical and dynamic model prediction. Finally, the standardized precipitation index (SPI) is calculated by the combined forecasting of annual precipitation to evaluate drought conditions. The results show that SST is an important factor affecting precipitation, which may be applied as a forecasting direction with other factors. The merged prediction by the CFSv2 original model and the statistical model does not have the great promotion, which is still low than the prediction by the statistical model. The merged prediction by the CFSv2 statistical downscaling model and the statistical model is better than the predictions by the two models, respectively. These indicate that when the prediction difference between the models is large, the merged prediction error cannot be minimized. When the prediction skill levels are equal, there is an improvement in the merged result. So, it is necessary to revise the climate dynamic model by downscaling. What is more, the obtained drought levels match the actual disaster conditions, providing theoretical support of hydrology and meteorology for the prevention of natural disasters.","[Zhao, Jun; Xu, Jinchao; Wang, Guoqing; Li, Xuechun] Nanjing Hydraul Res Inst, Nanjing 210029, Jiangsu, Peoples R China; [Zhao, Jun; Xu, Jinchao; Hu, Xiaojie] Nanjing Univ Informat Sci & Technol, Sch Hydrol & Water Resources, Nanjing 210044, Jiangsu, Peoples R China; [Jin, Juliang] Hefei Univ Technol, Sch Civil Engn, Hefei 230009, Anhui, Peoples R China; [Guo, Yan] Yellow River Conservancy Commiss, Yellow River Inst Hydraul Res, Zhengzhou 450003, Peoples R China",,"Zhao, J (corresponding author), Nanjing Hydraul Res Inst, Nanjing 210029, Jiangsu, Peoples R China.; Zhao, J (corresponding author), Nanjing Univ Informat Sci & Technol, Sch Hydrol & Water Resources, Nanjing 210044, Jiangsu, Peoples R China.",zsmzyq@126.com,,,"National Key Research and Development Program of China [2021YFC3201101, 2016YFA0601501, 2017YFC1502405, 2017YFC1502706, 2017YFA0605002]; China Postdoctoral Science FoundationChina Postdoctoral Science Foundation [2020T130309, 2019M651892]; China Scholarship CouncilChina Scholarship Council [201808320128, 201808320127]; Jiangsu Water Resources Science and Technology Project [2020022, 2021024]; Meteorological Open Research Fund in the Huai River Basin [HRM201702]; Nanjing University of Information Science & Technology Research Foundation [2017r097]","The authors acknowledge the support of the National Key Research and Development Program of China (Nos. 2021YFC3201101, 2016YFA0601501, 2017YFC1502405, 2017YFC1502706, and 2017YFA0605002), Project funded by the China Postdoctoral Science Foundation (Nos. 2020T130309 and 2019M651892), China Scholarship Council (Nos. 201808320128 and 201808320127), Jiangsu Water Resources Science and Technology Project (Nos. 2020022 and 2021024), Meteorological Open Research Fund in the Huai River Basin (No. HRM201702), and Nanjing University of Information Science & Technology Research Foundation (No. 2017r097).

As a result, it leads to overestimation of prognostic levels with actual state. This problem is most acute within the Almaty urban agglomeration. The choice of this region as a pioneer is obvious for hydrogeologists. Within the limits of the allocated territory as of 2008, the state balance accounts for about 15% of the total value of the drinking water quality of groundwater resources in the Republic of Kazakhstan. The volume of groundwater production within the region is about 45%. This burden on the subsoil is not presented in any other region of the Republic of Kazakhstan. On the basis of available developments in this issue, given appropriate solutions and ways of changing existing approaches to hydrogeological forecasts in estimating groundwater reserves are proposed to eliminate emerging inconsistencies, i.e. the implementation of forecasting taking into account the real, rather than overestimated in the calculation of the dynamics of water withdrawal.","[Sotnikov, Y.

Without doubt, this aspect is still essential for navigational users, but in light of the growing political intention to use the free capacity of the inland waterway transport in Europe, additional lead time supporting strategic decisions is more and more in demand. However, no such predictions offering extended lead times of several weeks up to several months currently exist for considerable parts of the European waterway network. This paper describes the set-up of a monthly to seasonal forecasting system for the German stretches of the international waterways of the Rhine, Danube and Elbe rivers. Two competitive forecast approaches have been implemented: the dynamical set-up forces a hydrological model with post-processed outputs from ECMWF general circulation model System 4, whereas the statistical approach is based on the empirical relationship (teleconnection) of global oceanic, climate and regional hydro-meteorological data with river flows. The performance of both forecast methods is evaluated in relation to the climatological forecast (ensemble of historical streamflow) and the well-known ensemble streamflow prediction approach (ESP, ensemble based on historical meteorology) using common performance indicators (correlation coefficient; mean absolute error, skill score; mean squared error, skill score; and continuous ranked probability, skill score) and an impact-based evaluation quantifying the potential economic gain. The following four key findings result from this study: (1) as former studies for other regions of central Europe indicate, the accuracy and/or skill of the meteorological forcing used has a larger effect than the quality of initial hydrological conditions for relevant stations along the German waterways. (2) Despite the predictive limitations on longer lead times in central Europe, this study reveals the existence of a valuable predictability of streamflow on monthly up to seasonal timescales along the Rhine, upper Danube and Elbe waterways, and the Elbe achieves the highest skill and economic value. (3) The more physically based and the statistical approach are able to improve the predictive skills and economic value compared to climatology and the ESP approach. The specific forecast skill highly depends on the forecast location, the lead time and the season. (4) Currently, the statistical approach seems to be most skilful for the three waterways investigated. The lagged relationship between the monthly and/or seasonal streamflow and the climatic and/or oceanic variables vary between 1 month (e.g. local precipitation, temperature and soil moisture) up to 6 months (e.g. sea surface temperature). Besides focusing on improving the forecast methodology, especially by combining the individual approaches, the focus is on developing useful forecast products on monthly to seasonal timescales for waterway transport and to operationalize the related forecasting service.","[Meissner, Dennis; Klein, Bastian] Fed Inst Hydrol, D-56068 Koblenz, Germany; [Ionita, Monica] Alfred Wegener Inst, D-27568 Bremerhaven, Germany; [Ionita, Monica] Bremen Univ, MARUM, Bremen, Germany",,"Meissner, D (corresponding author), Fed Inst Hydrol, D-56068 Koblenz, Germany.",meissner@bafg.de,"Ionita, Monica/AAX-3171-2020","Ionita, Monica/0000-0001-8240-4380",Research & Development Project Seamless Prediction - German Federal Ministry of Transport and Digital Infrastructure; EU-Horizon project IMPREX [641811]; AWIHelmholtz Association; Helmholtz Climate Initiative REKLIM,"This work was supported by the Research & Development Project Seamless Prediction financed by the German Federal Ministry of Transport and Digital Infrastructure and the EU-Horizon 2020 project IMPREX (grant agreement 641811, www.imprex.eu).

A new suite of products from the National Weather Service's Hydrologic Ensemble Forecast System (HEFS) provides short- and long-range forecasts, ranging from 6 h to 1 yr, and shows uncertainty in hydrologic forecasts. To understand how various audiences use and interpret ensemble forecasts showing a range of hydrologic forecast possibilities, a research project was conducted using scenario-based focus groups and surveys with community residents, emergency managers, and water resource managers in West Virginia and Maryland. The research assessed the utility of the HEFS products, identified barriers to proper understanding of the products, and suggested modifications to product design that could improve the understandability and accessibility for a range of users. There was a difference between the residential users' reactions to the HEFS compared to the emergency managers and water resource managers, with the public reacting less favorably to all versions. The emergency managers preferred the revised HEFS products but had suggestions for additional changes, which were incorporated. Features such as interactive text boxes and forecaster's notes further enhanced the utility and understandability of the products.","[Carr, Rachel Hogan; Semmens, Kathryn; Maxfield, Keri] Nurture Nat Ctr, Easton, PA 18042 USA; [Montz, Burrell; Connolly, Samantha] East Carolina Univ, Dept Geog Planning & Environm, Greenville, NC 27858 USA; [Ahnert, Peter; Shedd, Rob] NOAA, NWS, Middle Atlantic River Forecast Ctr, State Coll, PA USA; [Elliott, Jason] Natl Weather Serv, Weather Forecast Off, Sterling, VA USA",,"Carr, RH (corresponding author), Nurture Nat Ctr, Easton, PA 18042 USA.",rhogan@nurturenature.org,,,"Nurture Nature Center [NA16NWS4680004]; Collaborative Science, Technology, and Applied Research (CSTAR) Program; NOAA/NWS effort under the Office of Science and Technology","This paper was prepared by East Carolina University and the Nurture Nature Center under Award NA16NWS4680004, a social science research project funded as part of the Collaborative Science, Technology, and Applied Research (CSTAR) Program, a NOAA/NWS effort under the Office of Science and Technology.

A reservoir is a key water storage source in water management, where they are utilized by various sectors for different purposes. Therefore, there is an essential need in taking the best decision in releasing water from reservoirs not only to manage water as a resource, but also to mitigate floods, which has been one of the most expensive natural disasters causing an increased impact on human causalities and property damage. Research on predicting the future water height of reservoirs, when the reservoir receives a significant amount of rainfall and the water inflow is uncertain due to human intervention, are very limited. Hence, this research proposes a prediction model to forecast the future water height of a reservoir, when the reservoir receives a significant amount of rainfall and the water inflow is uncertain. It presents the effectiveness of applying K-Medoids clustering on top of regression model in predicting the future water height on next three days, while identifying the most effective set of features of the model.","[Rushdi, M.

The basin covers an area of about 5,000 km(2), it is located upstream of the Usumacinta River which drains into the Mexican Gulf, and it was selected as case study because it supplies the main hydropower plant of the country. Based on teleconnection principles and linear multiple regression analysis, statistical models were performed. The independent variables were oceanic and atmospheric indices used for monitoring El Nino South Oscillation (ENSO) by the National Weather Service/Climate Prediction Center of the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA). These variables include sea level pressures (SLP), southern oscillation index (SOI), sea surface temperatures (SST), and trade winds (TW) in different regions of the Tropical Pacific Ocean, as well as autocorrelation of the river flows. The dependent variable was the seasonal (three-monthly average) river flow into the hydropower reservoir Chixoy for the period 1980-2009, which was operated by the Guatemalan National Electrification Institute (INDE in Spanish). The models were assessed through multiple step-wise regression analysis and cross correlations lagged from 1 to 12 months. To appraise the forecast potential of the model, cross validation was performed where the correlation coefficient, the difference between the forecast and the observed river flow, and the standard error were evaluated. In addition, the Durbin-Watson test was applied to verify that there was no autocorrelation on residuals. Six models were developed for the trimesters September-October-November (r(2)=0.803); OctoberNovember-December (r(2)= 0.748); November-December-January (r(2)=0.818); December-JanuaryFebruary (r(2)=0.800); January-February-March (r(2)=0.820); and February-March-April (r(2) =0.855).","[Dobias, Jonas] Guatemalan Minist Energy & Mines, Diagonal 17,29-78 Zona 11, Ciudad De Guatemala 01011, Guatemala; [Salvinelli, Carlo] Univ Colorado, Dept Civil Environm & Architectural Engn, UCB 428, Boulder, CO 80309 USA",,"Dobias, J (corresponding author), Guatemalan Minist Energy & Mines, Diagonal 17,29-78 Zona 11, Ciudad De Guatemala 01011, Guatemala.",jdobias@mem.gob.gt; carlo.salvinelli@colorado.edu,"Salvinelli, Carlo/O-7938-2019",,,,,8,0,0,0,3,AMER SOC CIVIL ENGINEERS,NEW YORK,"UNITED ENGINEERING CENTER, 345 E 47TH ST, NEW YORK, NY 10017-2398 USA",,,978-0-7844-8141-7,,,,2018,,,,,,,280,286,,,,,7,Green & Sustainable Science & Technology; Environmental Sciences; Water Resources,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S),Science & Technology - Other Topics; Environmental Sciences & Ecology; Water Resources,BK4GQ,WOS:000436430300028,,,,,2022-02-17

However, the LAI can be affected by biophysical, climate, and anthropogenic factors, thus, its future watershed-scale patterns remain difficult to assess. Herein, an object-oriented watershed-scale LAI forecasting (OWLF) method is proposed to solve the forecasting difficulties encountered when using only past meteorological data. The model was constructed with filtered multi-year MODIS LAI time series and climate index variables. Then, the dependence of the LAI on four mean monthly climate index variables was evaluated, namely, latent evapotranspiration, rainfall capacity, average air temperature, and sunlight hours, in the Poyang Lake basin. By combining the climate indexes derived from the past 1-3months, the model forecasts the subsequent months LAI for different land cover types. The LAI forecasting results derived with a 13-year time series (2000-2012) suggest that the OWLF method can effectively recognize the expected spatial patterns, and the data agreed reasonably well with LAI dynamics and phenological periods. This work offers a promising way to exploit combined satellite and climate index data in novel and more accurate watershed-scale forecasting studies.","[Jiang, Hui; Liu, Yao] Nanchang Inst Technol, Natl & Local Joint Engn Lab Hydraul Engn Safety &, Nanchang 330099, Jiangxi, Peoples R China; [Gong, Jianya; Chen, Xiaoling] Wuhan Univ, State Key Lab Informat Engn Surveying Mapping & R, Wuhan 430079, Hubei, Peoples R China",,"Chen, XL (corresponding author), Wuhan Univ, State Key Lab Informat Engn Surveying Mapping & R, Wuhan 430079, Hubei, Peoples R China.",xiaoling_chen@whu.edu.cn,,,"National Natural Science Foundation of ChinaNational Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC) [51869012, 41461080, 41331174]; Natural Science Foundation of JiangxiNatural Science Foundation of Jiangxi Province [20171ACB21051]; Science and Technology Project of Jiangxi Education Department [GJJ170979]; Special Fund for Surveying and Mapping and Geoinformation Research in the Public Interest [201512026]","This research was supported by the National Natural Science Foundation of China (Nos. 51869012, 41461080, 41331174), the Natural Science Foundation of Jiangxi (No. 20171ACB21051), the Science and Technology Project of Jiangxi Education Department (GJJ170979) and the Special Fund for Surveying and Mapping and Geoinformation Research in the Public Interest (201512026).",,40,0,0,2,17,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"233 SPRING ST, NEW YORK, NY 10013 USA",1866-6280,1866-6299,,ENVIRON EARTH SCI,Environ.

Water pollution has posed a major problem and identifying the points of pollution in the River system is a very difficult task. To overcome this task, the need to determine the pollution level arose by modeling and predicting four water quality parameters at four (4) different locations using the Artificial Neural Network. These parameters include the pH, Total Dissolved Solids (TDS), Electrical Conductivity (EC), and Sodium (Na), respectively. The water quality results showed that the pH values which ranges from 6.01 to 6.87 were within the FAO standard in all the points for both rainy and dry seasons, whereas the TDS (mg/l), EC (dS/m) and Na (mg/l) parametric values range from 2001 to 2506, 3.01 to 5.76, and 40.42 to 73.45 respectively, were above the FAO standard from point 1 to point 3 and falls within the FAO standard at point 4 with values ranging from 1003 to 1994, 2.01 to 2.78 and 31.24 to 39.44, respectively. However, during the dry season, the TDS, EC, and Na values range from 2002 to 2742, 3.04 to 5.82 and 40.14 to 88.45 respectively, were all above the FAO standard. Generally, the artificial neural network modeled the actual water quality data set very well with good prediction. The training model performance evaluation shows that the R-2 values ranges from 0.981 to 0.990, 0.981 to 0.988, 0.981 to 0.989 and 0981 to 0.989, for pH, TDS, EC, and Na. The testing model performance shows that the R-2 value ranges from 0.952 to 0.967, 0.953 to 0.970, 0.951 to 0.967and 0.953 to 0.968, for pH, TDS, EC and Na while the forecast performance evaluation shows that the R-2 values ranges from 0.945 to 0.968, 0.946 to 0.968, 0.944 to 0.967 and 0.949 to 0.965 for pH, TDS, EC and Na respectively. It was also observed that the Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE) ranges from 0.022 to 0.088, 0.012 to 0.087, 0.015 to 0.085 and 0.014 to 0.084 for pH, TDS, EC and Na, respectively. Information from this study will serve as a guide to researchers on the water quality index for irrigation purposes. Also, it will guide the government and agencies on policy, management and decision-making on water resources.","[Ubah, J., I; Orakwe, L. C.; Ogbu, K. N.; Chukwuma, E.

In this paper, an integrated method including decomposition technique based on the ensemble empirical mode decomposition (EEMD) combined with multivariate adaptive regression spline (MARS) was carried out to predict daily streamflow values. Daily streamflow value datasets collected from two stations in Iran (Gachsar and Kordkheyl) were selected. After dividing into calibration and validation datasets, each of them was decomposed by EEMD. Crow search algorithm (CSA) was used to optimize the MARS parameters (MARS-CSA). The performance of the integrated model (EEMD-MARS-CSA) was investigated by error indices (correlation coefficient (R), root mean squared error (RMSE), mean absolute error (MAE), Nash-Sutcliffe efficiency (NSE), as well as RMSE to standard deviation ratio (RSR)). From the results, EEMD was an important tool for increasing model accuracy and EEMD-MARS-CSA outperformed other alternative methods for daily streamflow estimation. According to one-day-ahead flow forecasting, EEMD-MARS-CSA (R = 0.94, RMSE = 5.94 m(3)/s (Kordkheyl) and R = 0.98, RMSE = 0.71 m(3)/s (Gachsar)) outperformed EEMD-MT/MARS, MT, and MARS models. Furthermore, RSR criterion of EEMD-MARS-CSA was reduced by 18%, 16%, and 17% for 3-days, 1-week, and 2-weeks-ahead streamflow forecasting compared to MARS-CSA model, respectively, for Gachsar station.","[Torabi, Seyed Alireza; Mastouri, Reza; Najarchi, Mohsen] Islamic Azad Univ, Dept Civil Engn, Arak Branch, Arak, Iran",,"Mastouri, R (corresponding author), Islamic Azad Univ, Dept Civil Engn, Arak Branch, Arak, Iran.",r-mastouri@iau-arak.ac.ir,"Mastouri, Reza/AAO-1956-2021","Mastouri, Reza/0000-0003-0870-040X",,,,63,2,2,0,3,IWA PUBLISHING,LONDON,"ALLIANCE HOUSE, 12 CAXTON ST, LONDON SW1H0QS, ENGLAND",0003-7214,1365-2087,,J WATER SUPPLY RES T,J.

Given a storm advisory from the National Hurricane Center, the RFMS can generate a coastal inundation map on a high-resolution grid in 1 min (reference system Intel Core i7-3770K). The foundation of the RFMS is a storm surge database consisting of high-resolution simulations of 490 optimal storms generated by a robust storm surge modeling system, Curvilinear-Grid Hydrodynamics in 3D (CH3D-SSMS). The RFMS uses an efficient quick kriging interpolation scheme to interpolate the surge response from the storm surge database, which considers tens of thousands of combinations of five landfall parameters of storms: central pressure deficit, radius to maximum wind, forward speed, heading direction, and landfall location. The RFMS is applied to southwest Florida using data from Hurricane Charley in 2004 and Hurricane Irma in 2017, and to the Florida Panhandle using data from Hurricane Michael in 2018 and validated with observed high water mark data. The RFMS results agree well with observation and direct simulation of the high-resolution CH3D-SSMS. The RFMS can be used for real-time forecasting during a hurricane or what-if'' scenarios for mitigation planning and preparedness training, or to produce a probabilistic flood map. The RFMS can provide more accurate surge prediction with uncertainties if NHC can provide more accurate storm forecasts in the future. By incorporating storms for future climate and sea level rise, the RFMS could be used to generate future flood maps for coastal resilience and adaptation planning.","[Yang, Kun; Paramygin, Vladimir A.; Sheng, Y.

Artificial neural networks (ANNs) have the ability to discern linear or non-linear relationships despite very limited data inputs and can recognize even complex patterns in a data set without a priori understating of the underlying mechanism. Hence, we have used ANNs to develop a model linking CH4 emissions to five of the reservoir parameters about which data is most commonly available in the prior art. Using a compendium of all available data on these parameters, of which a small part was kept aside for use in model validation, it has been possible to develop a model which is able to forecast CH4 emissions with a root mean square error of 37. It indicates a precision significantly better than the ones achieved in previous reports. The model provides a means to estimate CH4 emissions from reservoirs of which age, mean depth, surface area, latitude and longitude are known.","[Tabassum-Abbasi] Univ Petr & Energy Studies, Dept Hlth Safety Environm & Civil Engn, Dehra Dun 248007, Uttarakhand, India; [Abbasi, Tasneem; Luithui, Chirchom; Abbasi, S.

This article provides a detailed review of the progress made in the field of seasonal prediction by India starting from the first attempt of seasonal prediction by India Meteorology Department (IMD) in 1886 based on empirical methods to the present day state-of-the-art coupled dynamical modelling framework developed under Monsoon Mission. The success and failures of seasonal prediction were amply documented in several articles particularly with more emphasis on its failures. Starting in the early 1900s, the empirical models performed very well for a few decades after which they started failing. As the relationship with predictors underwent significant changes, empirical models were also updated/revamped on several occasions. Prior to Monsoon Mission (before 2010) attempts were made to use dynamical models for seasonal prediction of Indian monsoon, particularly in the tier-II modelling framework, which was based upon the standalone Atmospheric General Circulation Models (AGCMs), albeit with limited success. The immediate need for coupled modelling framework in India was felt in 2008-09 for making seasonal forecasts, primarily to model the dynamical nature of Indian Monsoon and hence, a coupled dynamical modelling framework at a very high atmospheric horizontal resolution of similar to 38 km was implemented to make operational/experimental seasonal forecasts, so far unparalleled. The dynamical modelling framework will be upgraded in the future to contain an earth system framework with aerosols/greenhouse gases, ocean bio-geo chemistry and closed model hydrology.","[Rao, Suryachandra A.; Pillai, Prasanth A.; Pradhan, Maheshwar; Srivastava, Ankur] Indian Inst Trop Meteorol, Pune 411008, Maharashtra, India",,"Rao, SA (corresponding author), Indian Inst Trop Meteorol, Pune 411008, Maharashtra, India.",surya@tropmet.res.in,"A, RAO SURYACHANDRA/ABE-9913-2020",,Ministry of Earth Sciences,"Scientists of IMD who worked tirelessly, since 1870s to improve the seasonal forecasting of Indian Summer Monsoon for several decades, knowing very well that it is the second toughest prediction problem, certainly deserve appreciation for their efforts.

The physical features of the river basin are extremely hard to collect, especially for large rivers. Empirical data-driven models, such as stochastic and regression models, have been widely used in the field of streamflow forecasting. However, they suffered limited accuracy in predicting extreme streamflow. They also required raw data pre-processing prior to the modeling process, especially for lengthy data records and for large time-scale increments (e.g. monthly resolution). To overcome these challenges, data-driven forecasting models based on Artificial Intelligence (AI) have been widely used and resulted in enhancing the forecasting accuracy. Nevertheless, AI-based models required augmentation with proper optimization schemes to adjust the model parameters for optimal accuracy. Furthermore, in some cases, due to unsuitability of the optimization model, there is high possibility for overfitting of the AI model, which might cause poor prediction of input patterns that were not adequately mimicked. This study introduces a new approach to streamflow forecasting based on nonlinear system identification. The proposed technique employs Fast Orthogonal Search (FOS) to develop a nonlinear model of stream flow. The main advantage of using FOS is eliminating the requirement of raw data pre-processing and the need for an optimization scheme for model parameter adjustment since the FOS algorithm takes this into account while building the model. In addition, the FOS algorithm includes a pole-zero cancellation procedure that can detect and avoid the over-fitted models. The FOS-based nonlinear modeling approach was adopted in this research for the development of a streamflow forecasting model at Aswan High Dam using monthly basis natural streamflow records for 130 years. The results indicated that the proposed FOS algorithm outperformed the previously developed AI models of streamflow forecasting for large data records and for large time-scale increment (monthly resolution).","[Osman, Abdalla; Noureldin, Aboelmagd] Royal Mil Coll Canada, Dept Elect & Comp Engn, Kingston, ON, Canada; [Afan, Haitham Abdulmohsin] Duy Tan Univ, Inst Res & Dev, Da Nang 550000, Vietnam; [Allawi, Mohammed Falah] Minist Water Resources, State Commiss Dams & Reservoirs, Baghdad, Iraq; [Jaafar, Othman; Hamzah, Firdaus Mohamad] Univ Kebangsaan Malaysia, Dept Civil & Struct Engn, Bangi, Selangor, Malaysia; [Ahmed, Ali Najah] Univ Tenaga Nas, Inst Energy Infrastruct IEI, Kajang, Selangor, Malaysia; [El-shafie, Ahmed] Univ Malaya, Fac Engn, Dept Civil Engn, Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia; [El-shafie, Ahmed] United Arab Emirate Univ, Natl Water Ctr, Al Ain, U Arab Emirates",,"Afan, HA (corresponding author), Duy Tan Univ, Inst Res & Dev, Da Nang 550000, Vietnam.",haithamabdulmohsinafan@duytan.edu.vn,"El-Shafie, Ahmed/J-1799-2014; Afan, Haitham/ABF-2282-2021","El-Shafie, Ahmed/0000-0001-5018-8505; Afan, Haitham/0000-0002-4957-756X; Allawi, mohammed/0000-0002-2725-687X",Ministry of Higher Education Malaysia for Fundamental Research Grant Scheme (FRGS) [FRGS/1/2019/TK01/UNITEN/02/3]; University of MalayaUniversiti Malaya [GPF082A-2018],"The authors thankfully acknowledge Ministry of Higher Education Malaysia for Fundamental Research Grant Scheme (FRGS, Grant No.: FRGS/1/2019/TK01/UNITEN/02/3).

Detection of these long-term trends requires a good understanding of the system's natural state. The GOA is a highly dynamic system that exhibits large inorganic carbon variability on subseasonal to interannual timescales. This variability is poorly understood due to the lack of observations in this expansive and remote region. We developed a new model setup for the GOA that couples the three-dimensional Regional Oceanic Model System (ROMS) and the Carbon, Ocean Biogeochemistry and Lower Trophic (COBALT) ecosystem model. To improve our conceptual understanding of the system, we conducted a hindcast simulation from 1980 to 2013. The model was explicitly forced with temporally and spatially varying coastal freshwater discharges from a high-resolution terrestrial hydrological model, thereby affecting salinity, alkalinity, dissolved inorganic carbon, and nutrient concentrations. This represents a substantial improvement over previous GOA modeling attempts. Here, we evaluate the model on seasonal to interannual timescales using the best available inorganic carbon observations. The model was particularly successful in reproducing observed aragonite oversaturation and undersaturation of near-bottom water in May and September, respectively. The largest deficiency in the model is its inability to adequately simulate springtime surface inorganic carbon chemistry, as it overestimates surface dissolved inorganic carbon, which translates into an underestimation of the surface aragonite saturation state at this time. We also use the model to describe the seasonal cycle and drivers of inorganic carbon parameters along the Seward Line transect in undersampled months. Model output suggests that the majority of the near-bottom water along the Seward Line is seasonally undersaturated with respect to aragonite between June and January, as a result of upwelling and remineralization. Such an extensive period of reoccurring aragonite undersaturation may be harmful to ocean acidification-sensitive organisms. Furthermore, the influence of freshwater not only decreases the aragonite saturation state in coastal surface waters in summer and fall, but it simultaneously decreases the surface partial pressure of carbon dioxide (pCO(2)), thereby decoupling the aragonite saturation state from pCO(2). The full seasonal cycle and geographic extent of the GOA region is under-sampled, and our model results give new and important insights for months of the year and areas that lack in situ inorganic carbon observations.","[Hauri, Claudine; Irving, Brita] Univ Alaska Fairbanks, Int Arctic Res Ctr, Fairbanks, AK 99775 USA; [Schultz, Cristina; Doney, Scott C.] Univ Virginia, Dept Environm Sci, Clark Hall, Charlottesville, VA 22903 USA; [Hedstrom, Katherine; Danielson, Seth] Univ Alaska Fairbanks, Coll Fisheries & Ocean Sci, Fairbanks, AK USA; [Dussin, Raphael; Stock, Charles A.] Geophys Fluid Dynam Lab, Princeton, NJ USA; [Curchitser, Enrique N.] Rutgers State Univ, Dept Environm Sci, New Brunswick, NJ USA; [Hill, David F.] Oregon State Univ, Civil & Construct Engn, Corvallis, OR 97331 USA",,"Hauri, C (corresponding author), Univ Alaska Fairbanks, Int Arctic Res Ctr, Fairbanks, AK 99775 USA.",chauri@alaska.edu,"Doney, Scott C/F-9247-2010; Danielson, Seth/AAY-4384-2020","Doney, Scott C/0000-0002-3683-2437; Hauri, Claudine/0000-0002-5048-0028; Schultz, Cristina/0000-0003-2006-7053; Irving, Brita/0000-0002-9474-6203","National Science Foundation, Division of Ocean SciencesNational Science Foundation (NSF) [1459834, 1656070]; National Science Foundation, Office of Polar ProgramsNational Science Foundation (NSF) [1602654]; National Science Foundation, Office of Integrative ActivitiesNational Science Foundation (NSF) [1757348]","This research has been supported by the National Science Foundation, Division of Ocean Sciences (grant nos. 1459834 and 1656070); the National Science Foundation, Office of Polar Programs (grant no. 1602654); and the National Science Foundation, Office of Integrative Activities (grant no. 1757348).",,85,5,5,1,6,COPERNICUS GESELLSCHAFT MBH,GOTTINGEN,"BAHNHOFSALLEE 1E, GOTTINGEN, 37081, GERMANY",1726-4170,1726-4189,,BIOGEOSCIENCES,Biogeosciences,JUL 29,2020,17,14,,,,,3837,3857,,10.5194/bg-17-3837-2020,,,21,"Ecology; Geosciences, Multidisciplinary",Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),Environmental Sciences & Ecology; Geology,MX5VY,WOS:000557791700001,,"Green Submitted, gold",,,2022-02-17

We present a simple, low-cost, and robust approach for forecasting monthly and yearly streamflows during the current hydrological year, which is applicable to headwater catchments. The procedure innovatively combines the use of well-known regression analysis techniques, the two-parameter Gamma continuous cumulative probability distribution function and the Monte Carlo method. Several model performance statistics metrics (including the Coefficient of Determination R-2; the Root-Mean-Square Error RMSE; the Mean Absolute Error MAE; the Index of Agreement IOA; the Mean Absolute Percent Error MAPE; the Coefficient of Nash-Sutcliffe Efficiency NSE; and the Inclusion Coefficient IC) were used and the results showed good levels of accuracy (improving as the number of observed months increases). The model forecast outputs are the mean monthly and yearly streamflows along with the 10th and 90th percentiles. The methodology has been successfully applied to two headwater reservoirs within the Guadalquivir River Basin in southern Spain, achieving an accuracy of 92% and 80% in March 2017. These risk-based predictions are of great value, especially before the intensive irrigation campaign starts in the middle of the hydrological year, when Water Authorities have to ensure that the right decision is made on how to best allocate the available water volume between the different water users and environmental needs.","[Delgado-Ramos, Fernando] Univ Granada, Inst Water Res, Dept Struct Mech & Hydraul Engn, E-18071 Granada, Spain; [Delgado-Ramos, Fernando] Fdn Ctr Andaluz Invest Agua CETAQUA, Malaga 29590, Spain; [Hervas-Gamez, Carmen] Univ Granada, Dept Struct Mech & Hydraul Engn, E-18071 Granada, Spain",,"Delgado-Ramos, F (corresponding author), Univ Granada, Inst Water Res, Dept Struct Mech & Hydraul Engn, E-18071 Granada, Spain.; Delgado-Ramos, F (corresponding author), Fdn Ctr Andaluz Invest Agua CETAQUA, Malaga 29590, Spain.",fdelgado@ugr.es; karmina@correo.ugr.es,"Hervás-Gámez, Carmen/O-3797-2019","Hervás-Gámez, Carmen/0000-0002-1664-0753",Fundacion Centro Andaluz de Investigaciones del Agua (CETAQUA); EMASAGRA S.A.,This research was funded by Fundacion Centro Andaluz de Investigaciones del Agua (CETAQUA) and EMASAGRA S.A.,,35,6,6,0,5,MDPI,BASEL,"ST ALBAN-ANLAGE 66, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND",2073-4441,,,WATER-SUI,Water,AUG,2018,10,8,,,,,,,1038,10.3390/w10081038,,,26,Environmental Sciences; Water Resources,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),Environmental Sciences & Ecology; Water Resources,GY3OR,WOS:000448462700072,,"gold, Green Submitted",,,2022-02-17

Statistical indicators and the Soil and Water Assessment Tool (SWAT) model are employed to investigate the hydrological performances of the GMPs against the data of 17 rain gauges distributed across the CRB. The results show that there are strong correlations between the temperature reanalysis products in both CMADS and CFSR and those obtained from the ground-based observations (the correlation coefficients range from 0.92 to 0.97). The CFSR data overestimate precipitation (percentage bias approximately 99%) at both daily and monthly scales, whereas the CMADS product performs better, with obvious differences (compared to the ground-based observations) in high-terrain areas. Regarding the simulated river flows, CFSR-SWAT produced unsatisfactory, while CMADS-SWAT (R-2 > 0.76 and NSE > 0.78) performs better than CFSR-SWAT on the monthly scale. This assessment of the applicative potential of GMPs, especially CMADS, may further provide an additional rapid alternative for water resource research and management in basins with similar hydro-meteorological conditions.","[Dao, Duy Minh; Lu, Jianzhong; Chen, Xiaoling; Phan, Phamchimai] Wuhan Univ, State Key Lab Informat Engn Surveying Mapping & R, Wuhan 430079, Peoples R China; [Dao, Duy Minh] Thai Nguyen Univ Educ, Fac Geog, 20 Luong Ngoc Quyen, Thai Nguyen 250000, Vietnam; [Kantoush, Sameh A.; Binh, Doan Van] Kyoto Univ, Disaster Prevent Res Inst, Water Resources Ctr, Uji, Kyoto 6110011, Japan; [Phan, Phamchimai] Thai Nguyen Univ Sci, Fac Tourism, Thai Nguyen 250000, Vietnam; [Tung, Nguyen Xuan] VAST, Inst Marine Geol & Geophys, 18 Hoang Quoc Viet, Hanoi 100000, Vietnam",,"Lu, JZ (corresponding author), Wuhan Univ, State Key Lab Informat Engn Surveying Mapping & R, Wuhan 430079, Peoples R China.",daoduyminh87@gmail.com; lujzhong@whu.edu.cn; xiaoling_chen@whu.edu.cn; kantoush.samehahmed.2n@kyoto-u.ac.jp; doan.binhvan.3e@kyoto-u.ac.jp; phanphamchimai87@gmail.com; nxtung@imgg.vast.vn,"Lu, Jianzhong/E-5698-2013","Lu, Jianzhong/0000-0002-6432-8481; Dao, Duy Minh/0000-0001-7524-7268; Binh, Doan Van/0000-0002-7687-0550; KANTOUSH, Sameh Ahmed/0000-0003-0919-5097",National Key Research and Development Program [2018YFC1506506]; Frontier Project of the Applied Foundation of Wuhan [2019020701011502]; Key Research and Development Program of Jiangxi Province [20201BBG71002]; Natural Science Foundation of Hubei ProvinceNatural Science Foundation of Hubei Province [2019CFB736]; LIESMARS Special Research Funding; Asia-Pacific Network for Global Change Research [CRRP2020-09MY-Kantoush],"This research was funded by the National Key Research and Development Program (2018YFC1506506), the Frontier Project of the Applied Foundation of Wuhan (2019020701011502), the Key Research and Development Program of Jiangxi Province (20201BBG71002), the Natural Science Foundation of Hubei Province (2019CFB736), the LIESMARS Special Research Funding, and the Asia-Pacific Network for Global Change Research under project reference number CRRP2020-09MY-Kantoush.",,51,1,1,2,4,MDPI,BASEL,"ST ALBAN-ANLAGE 66, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND",,2073-4441,,WATER-SUI,Water,MAY,2021,13,9,,,,,,,1314,10.3390/w13091314,,,19,Environmental Sciences; Water Resources,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),Environmental Sciences & Ecology; Water Resources,SC7MY,WOS:000650851400001,,gold,,,2022-02-17

However, cyanobacteria blooms are very complicated because of the internal stochastic nature of the system evolution and the external uncertainty of the observation data. In this study, an adaptive-clustering algorithm is introduced to obtain some typical operating intervals. In addition, the number of nearest neighbors used for modeling was optimized by particle swarm optimization. Finally, a fuzzy linear regression method based on error-correction was used to revise the model dynamically near the operating point. We found that the combined method can characterize the evolutionary track of cyanobacteria blooms in lakes and reservoirs. The model constructed in this paper is compared to other cyanobacteria-bloom forecasting methods (e.g., phase space reconstruction and traditional-clustering linear regression), and, then, the average relative error and average absolute error are used to compare the accuracies of these models. The results suggest that the proposed model is superior. As such, the newly developed approach achieves more precise predictions, which can be used to prevent the further deterioration of the water environment.","[Bai, Xiao-zhe; Zhang, Hui-yan; Wang, Xiao-yi; Wang, Li; Xu, Ji-ping; Yu, Jia-bin] Beijing Technol & Business Univ, Sch Comp & Informat Engn, Beijing 100048, Peoples R China",,"Zhang, HY (corresponding author), Beijing Technol & Business Univ, Sch Comp & Informat Engn, Beijing 100048, Peoples R China.",zhanghuiyan369@126.com,,,University Innovation Ability to Enhance the Project of Beijing [PXM2014_014213_000033]; Science and Technology Key Project of Beijing Municipal Education Commission [KZ201510011011]; National Natural Science Foundation of ChinaNational Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC) [51179002],"This work was financially supported by University Innovation Ability to Enhance the Project of Beijing Municipal no.

The need for this research is justified as it could prove helpful in establishing guidelines for hydrological designers, the planning and management of water, hydropower engineering projects, as an indicator for weather prediction, and for the people who are greatly dependent on the Kabul River for their survival.","[Musarat, Muhammad Ali; Alaloul, Wesam Salah; Ali, Mujahid; Altaf, Muhammad; Rafiq, Waqas] Univ Teknol PETRONAS, Dept Civil & Environm Engn, Bandar Seri Iskandar 32610, Perak, Malaysia; [Rabbani, Muhammad Babar Ali] Sarhad Univ Sci & Informat Technol, Dept Civil Engn, Peshawar 25000, Pakistan; [Fediuk, Roman] Far Eastern Fed Univ, Polytech Inst, Vladivostok 690000, Russia; [Vatin, Nikolai] Peter Great St Petersburg Polytech Univ, Inst Civil Engn, St Petersburg 195291, Russia; [Klyuev, Sergey] Belgorod State Technol Univ VG Shukhov, Dept Theoret Mech & Resistance Mat, Belgorod 308012, Russia; [Bukhari, Hamna] Natl Univ Sci & Technol, NITS CEE, Natl Inst Transport, Islamabad 44000, Pakistan; [Sadiq, Alishba] Univ Teknol PETRONAS, Elect & Elect Engn Dept, Ctr Intelligent Signal & Imaging Res CISIR, Bandar Seri Iskandar 32610, Perak, Malaysia; [Rafiq, Waqas] COMSATS Univ Islamabad Wah Campus, Dept Civil Engn, Wah Cantt 47000, Pakistan; [Farooq, Waqas] Sarhad Univ Sci & Informat Technol, Dept Elect Engn, Peshawar 25000, Pakistan",,"Alaloul, WS (corresponding author), Univ Teknol PETRONAS, Dept Civil & Environm Engn, Bandar Seri Iskandar 32610, Perak, Malaysia.; Fediuk, R (corresponding author), Far Eastern Fed Univ, Polytech Inst, Vladivostok 690000, Russia.",muhammad_19000316@utp.edu.my; wesam.alaloul@utp.edu.my; babaralirabbani@yahoo.com; mujahid_19001704@utp.edu.my; muhammad_20000250@utp.edu.my; roman44@yandex.ru; vatin@mail.ru; Klyuyev@yandex.ru; hamna.bukhari24@gmail.com; alishba_18001778@utp.edu.my; waqas_18000277@utp.edu.my; waqasfarooq.ee@gmail.com,"Vatin, Nikolai Ivanovich/O-6995-2019; Ali, Mujahid/AAU-2426-2021; Klyuev, Sergey/W-4457-2017; Fediuk, Roman S/N-6730-2017","Vatin, Nikolai Ivanovich/0000-0002-1196-8004; Ali, Mujahid/0000-0003-4376-0459; Klyuev, Sergey/0000-0002-1995-6139; Fediuk, Roman S/0000-0002-2279-1240; Altaf, Muhammad/0000-0001-5315-3308; Rabbani, Muhammad Babar Ali/0000-0002-1728-026X; Musarat, Muhammad Ali/0000-0003-0298-7796",Ministry of Science and Higher Education of the Russian Federation as part of World-class Research Center program: Advanced Digital Technologies [075-15-2020-934],The research is partially funded by the Ministry of Science and Higher Education of the Russian Federation as part of World-class Research Center program: Advanced Digital Technologies (contract No. 075-15-2020-934 dated 17 November 2020).,,93,1,1,2,2,MDPI,BASEL,"ST ALBAN-ANLAGE 66, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND",,2071-1050,,SUSTAINABILITY-BASEL,Sustainability,OCT,2021,13,19,,,,,,,10720,10.3390/su131910720,,,26,Green & Sustainable Science & Technology; Environmental Sciences; Environmental Studies,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Science & Technology - Other Topics; Environmental Sciences & Ecology,WH5YJ,WOS:000707752500001,,gold,,,2022-02-17

Globally generalized methods for approximating outflow are required but must contend with operational complexity and a dearth of information on dam characteristics at global spatial scales. There is currently no consensus on the best approach for approximating reservoir release rates in large spatial scale hydrologic forecasting, particularly at diurnal time steps. This research compares two parsimonious reservoir routing methods at daily steps: Doll et al. (2003) and Hanasaki et al. (2006). These reservoir routing methods have been previously implemented in large-scale hydrologic modeling applications and have been typically evaluated seasonally. These routing methods are compared across 60 reservoirs operated by the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers. The authors vary empirical coefficients for both reservoir routing methods as part of a sensitivity analysis. The method proposed by Doll et al. (2003) outperformed that presented by Hanasaki et al. (2006) at a daily time step and improved model skill over most run-of-the-river conditions. The temporal resolution of the model influences model performances. The optimal model coefficients varied across the reservoirs in this study and model performance fluctuates between wet years and dry years, and for different configurations such as dams in series. Overall, the method proposed by Doll et al. (2003) could enhance large-scale hydrologic forecasting, but can be subject to instability under certain conditions.","[Gutenson, Joseph L.; Tavakoly, Ahmad A.; Wahl, Mark D.; Follum, Michael L.] US Army, Engineer Res & Dev Ctr, Coastal & Hydraul Lab, 3909 Halls Ferry Rd, Vicksburg, MS 39180 USA; [Tavakoly, Ahmad A.] Univ Maryland, Earth Syst Sci Interdisciplinary Ctr, College Pk, MD 20740 USA; [Gutenson, Joseph L.] NOAA, Natl Water Ctr, 205 Hackberry Ln, Tuscaloosa, AL 35401 USA; [Follum, Michael L.] US Bur Reclamat, Wyoming Area Off, 705 Pendell Blvd, Mills, WY 82644 USA",,"Gutenson, JL (corresponding author), US Army, Engineer Res & Dev Ctr, Coastal & Hydraul Lab, 3909 Halls Ferry Rd, Vicksburg, MS 39180 USA.; Gutenson, JL (corresponding author), NOAA, Natl Water Ctr, 205 Hackberry Ln, Tuscaloosa, AL 35401 USA.",jlgutenson@gmail.com; ah-mad.a.tavakoly@erdc.dren.mil,"Wahl, Mark D./C-6896-2012","Wahl, Mark D./0000-0002-2498-8602; Tavakoly, Ahmad A./0000-0002-2163-2627",Mississippi River Geomorphology and Potamology (MRGP) Program [470711]; U.S. Army Engineer Research and Development Center Military Engineering (Austere Entry); U.S. Army Engineer Research and Development Center Geospatial Research and Engineering (Climate Adaptive Mission Planning (CAMP)); U.S. Army Engineer Research and Development Center Environmental Quality and Installations (Climate Adaptive Mission Planning (CAMP)),"This research has been supported by the Mississippi River Geomorphology and Potamology (MRG&P) Program (project 470711), the U.S. Army Engineer Research and Development Center Military Engineering (Austere Entry), the U.S. Army Engineer Research and Development Center Geospatial Research and Engineering (Climate Adaptive Mission Planning (CAMP)), and the U.S. Army Engineer Research and Development Center Environmental Quality and Installations (Climate Adaptive Mission Planning (CAMP)).",,44,9,9,3,4,COPERNICUS GESELLSCHAFT MBH,GOTTINGEN,"BAHNHOFSALLEE 1E, GOTTINGEN, 37081, GERMANY",1027-5606,1607-7938,,HYDROL EARTH SYST SC,Hydrol.

Artificial neural network (ANN) have shown its remarkable ability in forecasting non-linear hydrological processes without involvement of complex, dynamic, hydrological and hydro-climatologic physical process in the water shed. To improve its non-stationary responses, decomposition methods are adopted as pre-processing methods in this study including Empirical Mode Decomposition (EMD), Ensemble Empirical Mode Decomposition (EEMD) and Seasonal-Trend decomposition using Loess (STL). The original time sequence is decomposed to several components, which are then taken as the inputs of the ANN model. EMD and EEMD are data- adaptable methods, and thus the number of Intrinsic Mode Functions (IMFs) might differ for different sequences, leading to the discrepancy of the input number for ANN model in training and predicting. Fisher's ordered clustering is thus used to classify the IMFs into a determined number of classes based on their frequency spectrum resulting from Maximum Entropy Spectral Analysis (MESA). The proposed methodology is applied on four important hydrological stations on the upper stream of the Yellow River and the Yangtze River in China, respectively, to forecast the streamflow of the next whole year with the historical daily data of the past 6years. The Nash-Sutcliffe efficiencies of the monthly prediction are higher than 0.85 for all of the four cases, and various indicators indicates that the proposed hybrid method of STL-ANN performs better than other compared methods. The highlights of this study lies in that only historical daily streamflow data is used to derive an accurate long-term prediction by data mining based on decomposition technology and mapping relationships between the decomposed components and the original sequence in the future.","[Li, Fang-Fang; Zhao, Xiao; Xie, En] China Agr Univ, Coll Water Resources & Civil Engn, Beijing 100083, Peoples R China; [Wang, Zhi-Yu] Shandong Water Conservancy Vocat Coll, Rizhao 276826, Peoples R China; [Qiu, Jun] Tsinghua Univ, State Key Lab Hydrosci & Engn, Beijing 100084, Peoples R China",,"Qiu, J (corresponding author), Tsinghua Univ, State Key Lab Hydrosci & Engn, Beijing 100084, Peoples R China.",aeroengine@tsinghua.edu.cn,"Zhao, Xiao/D-9430-2018","Zhao, Xiao/0000-0002-8630-1925; Qiu, Jun/0000-0003-2933-0727; Li, Fang-Fang/0000-0001-7007-5284","Integration Program of the Major Research Plan of the National Natural Science Foundation of China [91847302]; National Natural Science Foundation of ChinaNational Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC) [51879137]; National Key R&D Program of China [2017YFC0403600, 2017YFC0403602]","This research was supported by the Integration Program of the Major Research Plan of the National Natural Science Foundation of China (91847302), the National Natural Science Foundation of China (51879137), and National Key R&D Program of China (2017YFC0403600, 2017YFC0403602).",,35,4,4,2,26,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0920-4741,1573-1650,,WATER RESOUR MANAG,Water Resour.

This paper introduces the multi-temporal hydrological residual error (MuTHRE) model to address the challenge of obtaining seamless subseasonal forecasts - that is, daily forecasts with consistent high-quality performance over multiple lead times (1-30 days) and aggregation scales (daily to monthly). The key advance of the MuTHRE model is combining the representation of three temporal characteristics of hydrological residual errors: seasonality, dynamic biases, and non-Gaussian errors. The MuTHRE model is applied in 11 Australian catchments using the hydrological model GR4J and post processed rainfall forecasts from the numerical weather prediction model ACCESS-S, and is evaluated against a baseline model that does not model these error characteristics. The MuTHRE model provides high improvements (practically significant in the majority of performance stratifications) in terms of reliability: (i) at short lead times (up to 10 days), due to representing non-Gaussian errors, (ii) stratified by month, due to representing seasonality in hydrological errors, and (iii) in dry years, due to representing dynamic biases in hydrological errors. Forecast performance also improves in terms of sharpness, volumetric bias, and CRPS skill score; these improvements are statistically but not practically significant in the majority of stratifications. Importantly, improvements are consistent across multiple time scales (daily and monthly). This study highlights the benefits of modeling multiple temporal characteristics of hydrological errors and demonstrates the power of the MuTHRE model for producing seamless subseasonal streamflow forecasts that can be utilized for a wide range of applications.","[McInerney, David; Thyer, Mark; Kavetski, Dmitri] Univ Adelaide, Sch Civil Environm & Min Engn, Adelaide, SA, Australia; [Laugesen, Richard; Tuteja, Narendra] Bur Meteorol, Canberra, ACT, Australia; [Kuczera, George] Univ Newcastle, Sch Engn, Callaghan, NSW, Australia",,"McInerney, D (corresponding author), Univ Adelaide, Sch Civil Environm & Min Engn, Adelaide, SA, Australia.",david.mcinerney@adelaide.edu.au,"Thyer, Mark A/A-9630-2011; McInerney, David/I-4896-2015","Thyer, Mark A/0000-0002-2830-516X; McInerney, David/0000-0003-4876-8281; Laugesen, Richard/0000-0002-3811-5845",Australian Bureau of Meteorology,This work was funded directly by the Australian Bureau of Meteorology.

Such an approach has been developed for the Swan-Canning Estuary system, a eutrophic urban estuary in Western Australia under threat from nutrient enrichment and a drying climate. Numerical modelling was integrated with long-term monitoring to develop the system Swan-Canning Estuary Virtual Observatory (SCEVO), which has been used to facilitate water quality management and streamline prediction workflows of hindcast, forecast, and environmental response functions. The system is based on a validated 3D water quality model, integrated within a data management system and related environmental models. A machine-learning method to improve the patchy and time-lagged catchment inputs is also highlighted. This work has identified that the key challenge associated with estuarine water quality prediction is the capability to (1) simulate internal physical and biogeochemical processes at suitable spatial resolution to resolve the gradients along the freshwater-ocean continuum; and (2) transition from using routine monitoring data as the basis for management decisions to using a diverse and integrated set of data streams as the basis for real-time operational decisions.

In this paper, an approach of model fusion technique named selected model fusion (SMF) is applied and assessed under two strategies of model selection in order to improve the accuracy of streamflow forecasting. The two strategies of SMF are: fusion of the outputs of best individual forecasting models (IFMs) selected by dendrogram analysis (S1), and fusion of the best outputs of all IFMs resulting from an ordered selection algorithm (S2). In both strategies, five data-driven models including: artificial neural network, generalized regression neural network, least square-support vector regression, K-nearest neighbor regression, and multiple linear regression with optimized structure are performed as IFMs. The SMF strategies are applied for forecasting the monthly inflow to Karkheh reservoir, Iran, owning various patterns between predictor and predicted variables in different months. Results show that applying SMF approach based on both strategies results in more accurate forecasts in comparison with fusion of all IFMs outputs (S3), as the benchmark. However, comparison of the two SMF strategies reveals that the implementation of strategy (S2) considerably improves the accuracy of forecasts than strategy (S1) as well as the best IFM results (S4) in all months.","[Modaresi, Fereshteh; Araghinejad, Shahab; Ebrahimi, Kumars] Univ Tehran, Tehran, Iran",,"Modaresi, F (corresponding author), Univ Tehran, Tehran, Iran.",fmodaresi@ut.ac.ir,"Modaresi, Fereshteh/AAU-5589-2020","Modaresi, Fereshteh/0000-0001-7033-5402",,,,45,4,4,0,13,IWA PUBLISHING,LONDON,"ALLIANCE HOUSE, 12 CAXTON ST, LONDON SW1H0QS, ENGLAND",1464-7141,1465-1734,,J HYDROINFORM,J.

In this paper, a wavelet-hybrid artificial neural network (ANN) model integrated with iterative input selection (IIS) algorithm (IIS-W-ANN) is evaluated for its statistical preciseness in forecasting monthly streamflow, and it is then benchmarked against M5 Tree model. To develop hybrid IIS-W-ANN model, a global predictor matrix is constructed for three local hydrological sites (Richmond, Gwydir, and Darling River) in Australia's agricultural (Murray-Darling) Basin. Model inputs comprised of statistically significant lagged combination of streamflow water level, are supplemented by meteorological data (i.e., precipitation, maximum and minimum temperature, mean solar radiation, vapor pressure and evaporation) as the potential model inputs. To establish robust forecasting models, iterative input selection (US) algorithm is applied to screen the best data from the predictor matrix and is integrated with the non-decimated maximum overlap discrete wavelet transform (MODWT) applied on the IIS-selected variables. This resolved the frequencies contained in predictor data while constructing a wavelet-hybrid (i.e., IIS-W-ANN and IIS-W-M5 Tree) model. Forecasting ability of US-W-ANN is evaluated via correlation coefficient (r), Willmott's Index (WI), Nash-Sutcliffe Efficiency (E-NS), root-mean-square-error (RMSE), and mean absolute error (MAE), including the percentage RMSE and MAE. While ANN models are seen to outperform M5 Tree executed for all hydrological sites, the IIS variable selector was efficient in determining the appropriate predictors, as stipulated by the better performance of the IIS coupled (ANN and M5 Tree) models relative to the models without IIS. When IIS-coupled models are integrated with MODWT, the wavelet-hybrid IIS-W-ANN and IIS-W-M5 Tree are seen to attain significantly accurate performance relative to their standalone counterparts. Importantly, IIS-W-ANN model accuracy outweighs IIS-ANN, as evidenced by a larger r and WI (by 7.5% and 3.8%, respectively) and a lower RMSE (by 21.3%). In comparison to the IIS-W-M5 Tree model, IIS-W-ANN model yielded larger values of WI = 0.936-0.979 and E-NS = 0.770-0.920. Correspondingly, the errors (RMSE and MAE) ranged from 0.162-0.487 m and 0.139-0.390 m, respectively, with relative errors, RRMSE = (15.65-21.00) % and MAPE = (14.79-20.78) %. Distinct geographic signature is evident where the most and least accurately forecasted streamflow data is attained for the Gwydir and Darling River, respectively. Conclusively, this study advocates the efficacy of iterative input selection, allowing the proper screening of model predictors, and subsequently, its integration with MODWT resulting in enhanced performance of the models applied in streamflow forecasting.","[Prasad, Ramendra; Deo, Ravinesh C.; Li, Yan; Maraseni, Tek] Univ Southern Queensland, Inst Agr & Environm IAg&E, Sch Agr Computat & Environm Sci, Springfield, Qld 4300, Australia",,"Deo, RC (corresponding author), Univ Southern Queensland, Inst Agr & Environm IAg&E, Sch Agr Computat & Environm Sci, Springfield, Qld 4300, Australia.",ramendra.prasad@usq.edu.au; ravinesh.deo@usq.edu.au,"Deo, Ravinesh/F-6157-2012; Prasad, Ramendra/AAT-2908-2021","Deo, Ravinesh/0000-0002-2290-6749; Maraseni, Tek/0000-0001-9361-1983; Prasad, Ramendra/0000-0003-3941-5839; Li, Yan/0000-0002-4694-4926",Office of Research and Graduate Studies University of Southern Queensland Postgraduate Research Scholarship (USQ-PRS); USQ Academic Division and Outside Studies program grant (ADOSP),"The data were acquired from NSW Department of Primary Industries Data Portal, Scientific Information for Land Owners (SILO) Portal developed by Queensland Department of Environment and Resource Management and the Australian Bureau of Meteorology.

Finally, hydrological model using combined SWAT and ANN tools were obtained, which called hybrid SWAT-ANN model. The root means square error (RMSE) and coefficient of determination (R-2) for Asmawa and Khanis stations using hybrid SWAT-ANN model were found to be more efficient than SWAT model in forecasting the daily streamflow of the basin.

Timely and accurate flood forecasting can effectively reduce losses to human life and property and improve the utilization of flood resources. In this study, a real-time flood classification and prediction method (RFC-P) was constructed based on factor analysis, the k-means++ clustering algorithm, SSE, a backpropagation neural network (BPNN) and the M-EIES model. Model parameters of different flood types were obtained to forecast floods. The RFC-P method was applied to the Jingle sub-basin in Shanxi Province. The results showed that the RFC-P method can be used for the real-time classification and prediction of floods. The parameters of the flood classification and prediction model were consistent with the characteristics of the flood events. Compared with the results of unclassified predictions, the Nash coefficient increased by 5%-11.62%, the relative error of the average flood peak was reduced by 6.08%-12.7%, the relative error of the average flood volume was reduced by 5.74%-8.07%, and the time difference of the average peak was reduced by 43%-66% based on the proposed approach. The methodology proposed in this study can be used to identify extreme flood events and provide scientific support for flood classification and prediction, flood control and disaster reduction in river basins, and the efficient utilization of water resources.","[Hu Caihong; Zhang Xueli; Liu Chengshuai; Jian Shengqi] Zhengzhou Univ, Coll Water Conservancy Sci & Engn, Zhengzhou 450001, Peoples R China; [Hu Caihong; Zhang Xueli; Liu Chengshuai] Yellow River Inst Ecol Protect & Reg Coordinated, Zhengzhou 450001, Peoples R China; [Li Changqing] Shangdong Survey & Design Inst Water Conservancy, Jinan 250013, Peoples R China; [Wang Jinxing] Minist Water Resources, Informat Ctr, Beijing 100032, Peoples R China; [Jian Shengqi] CAS & MWR, State Key Lab Soil Eris & Dryland Farming Loess P, Inst Soil & Water Conservat, Yangling 712100, Shaanxi, Peoples R China",,"Jian, SQ (corresponding author), Zhengzhou Univ, Coll Water Conservancy Sci & Engn, Zhengzhou 450001, Peoples R China.; Jian, SQ (corresponding author), CAS & MWR, State Key Lab Soil Eris & Dryland Farming Loess P, Inst Soil & Water Conservat, Yangling 712100, Shaanxi, Peoples R China.",jiansq@zzu.edu.cn,,,National key research priorities program of China [2019YFC1510703]; National Natural Science Foundation of ChinaNational Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC) [51979250]; Key projects of National Natural Science Foundation of ChinaNational Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC) [51739009]; Natural Science Foundation of Henan Province [212300410413]; Young Talents Promotion Project of Henan Province [2021HYTP030]; State Key Laboratory of Soil Erision and Dryland Farming on the Loess Plateau Foundation [A314021402-2021011],"This project was supported by National key research priorities program of China (2019YFC1510703), National Natural Science Foundation of China (51979250), Key projects of National Natural Science Foundation of China (51739009), Natural Science Foundation of Henan Province (212300410413), Young Talents Promotion Project of Henan Province (2021HYTP030), State Key Laboratory of Soil Erision and Dryland Farming on the Loess Plateau Foundation (A314021402-2021011).",,38,0,0,7,7,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0920-4741,1573-1650,,WATER RESOUR MANAG,Water Resour.

In this study, a regional model using an artificial neural network (ANN) is proposed for monthly runoff forecasting, which considers stations linked to the network that belong to the same homogeneous region, and are delimited using K-means (KM-ANN) and L-moments (LM-ANN) techniques. This methodology was applied to a sample of 90 monthly runoff series in southern Canada. The results were compared to those of a traditional neural network for a given site (ANNs) using statistical indices, such as root-mean-squared error (RMSE), relative square error (RSE), mean absolute error (MAE), relative absolute error (RAE), the concordance index (d) and the coefficient of determination (r(2)). The LM-ANN technique produced better forecasts in 56.7% of the analysed stations, whereas the KM-ANN and ANN techniques produced better forecasts in 27.7% and 15.6% of the stations, respectively. Thus, the results indicate that the regionalisation process improved the forecasts in 84.4% of the studied cases, and the estimation uncertainty was reduced by an average of 31.8%, according to the RMSE, RSE, MAE and RAE values.

The Distance Distribution Dynamic (DDD) is a parsimonious rainfall-runoff model which is being used for flood forecasting at the Norwegian flood forecasting service. The model, like many other models, underestimates floods in many cases. To improve the flood peak prediction, we propose a dynamic river network method into the model. The method is applied for 15 catchments in Norway and tested on 91 flood peaks. The performance of DDD in terms of KGE and BIAS is identical with and without dynamic river network, but the relative error (RE) and mean absolute relative error (MARE) of the simulated flood peaks are improved significantly with the method. The 0.75 and 0.25 quantiles of the RE are reduced from 41% to 23% and from 22% to 1%, respectively. The MARE is reduced from 32.9% to 15.7%.

In the present study, the particle swarm optimization (PSO) algorithm was utilized to optimally determine the parameters of the extreme learning machine (ELM) model, and a novel hybrid PSO-ELM model was thus proposed for estimating daily ETo in the arid region of Northwest China with limited input data. The PSO-ELM model was compared with the original ELM, artificial neural networks (ANN) and random forests (RF) models as along with six empirical models (including radiation-, temperature- and mass transfer-based empirical models). Three input combinations were utilized to develop the data-driven models, which corresponded to the radiation-, temperature- and mass transfer-based models, respectively. The results indicated that machine learning models provided more accurate ETo estimates, compared with the corresponding empirical models with the same inputs. The hybrid PSO-ELM model exhibited better performance than the other models for daily ETo estimation as indicated by the statistical results. Although radiation-based machine learning models outperformed temperature- and mass transfer-based machine learning models, the temperature-based PSO-ELM model obtained reasonable results when only air temperature data were available, which was considered as a promising model for forecasting future ETo with temperature data. Overall, the PSO-ELM model was superior to the other machine learning and empirical models, which was thus recommended to predict daily ETo with limited inputs in the arid region of Northwest China.","[Zhu, Bin; Feng, Yu; Jiang, Shouzheng; Zhao, Lu; Cui, Ningbo] Sichuan Univ, State Key Lab Hydraul & Mt River Engn, Chengdu, Peoples R China; [Zhu, Bin; Feng, Yu; Jiang, Shouzheng; Zhao, Lu; Cui, Ningbo] Sichuan Univ, Coll Water Resource & Hydropower, Chengdu, Peoples R China; [Feng, Yu; Gong, Daozhi] Chinese Acad Agr Sci, Inst Environm & Sustainable Dev Agr, Beijing, Peoples R China",,"Cui, NB (corresponding author), Sichuan Univ, Coll Water Resource & Hydropower, Chengdu, Peoples R China.",cuiningbo@126.com,,"gong, daozhi/0000-0002-3198-9929","National Key Research and Development Program of China [2016YFC0400206]; National Natural Science Foundation of ChinaNational Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC) [51922072, 51779161, 51009161]; Central University Special Fund Basic Research and Operating Expenses [2018CDPZH-10, 2016CDDY-S04SCU, 2017CDLZ-N22]","The climatic data used was obtained from the China Meteorological Administration.

Water samples for the study were taken in spring (April) and summer (July) from the Seret River at two points: above and below Ternopil. It is established that the chemical composition of the water of the river Seret is formed under the influence of a number of factors, but seasonal and anthropogenic factors play a dominant role. In the spring season, a number of hydrochemical indicators (pH, water hardness, concentration of NO2-, NH4+, Cl- ions and metals) have lower values than in the summer. In addition, there is an increase in the amount of organic matter, ammonium cations, nitrite ions, chloride ions, phosphate ions and a decrease in oxygen concentration below Ternopil, especially in the summer season. This is evidence that the Seret River is under significant anthropogenic impact. An increase in the concentration of metals (Mn, Cu and Pb) in summer below Ternopil was revealed, which may be due to the discharge of insufficiently treated wastewater. The series of metal concentrations in the water of the Seret River looks as follows Mn -> Zn -> Pb -> Cd -> Cu, and the series of accumulation of metals in the tissues of molluscs Unio pictorum L. has the form Zn. Mn. Cu. Pb. Cd. On the basis of bioaccumulation coefficients of heavy metals by molluscs, a prediction of the situation on their content in water for the short term based on the theory of Markov chains was made. This theory allows us to make forecasts of a factor, taking into account the possibility of accidental influences on the environment, and to investigate the highest probability of finding a factor in a certain numerical parameter. The possibility of using economic and mathematical modelling tools and statistical methods based on correlation-regression analysis using modern Matlab information systems to identify correlations between chemical indicators of water quality and biological molluscs for modelling the environmental situation of the river Seret and assessing the contribution of the studied indicators in pollution of small rivers is shown.","[Humeniuk, Halyna B.; Khomenchuk, Volodymyr O.; Chen, Iryna B.] Ternopil Volodymyr Hnatiuk Natl Pedag Univ, Ternopol, Ukraine; [Harmatiy, Nataliia M.] Ternopil Ivan Pului Natl Tech Univ, Ternopol, Ukraine",,"Harmatiy, NM (corresponding author), Ternopil Ivan Pului Natl Tech Univ, Ternopol, Ukraine.",garmatiy.nat@meta.ua; irynachen35@gmail.com,"Khomenchuk, Volodymyr/I-7490-2018","Khomenchuk, Volodymyr/0000-0003-0500-6754",,,,26,0,0,1,1,OLES GONCHAR DNIPRO NATL UNIV,DNIPRO,"GEOLOGY & GEOGRAPHY DEPT, DMYTRO YAVOMITSKYI, 36, DNIPRO, 49066, UKRAINE",2617-2909,2617-2119,,J GEOL GEOGR GEOECOL,J.

First, the large and middle scale basins is divided into several interconnected sub-basins. Second, basin runoff forecasting model is given based on iterative computing of sub-basin runoff forecast value. Finally, by adopting the streaming big data processing method, the runoff of the sub-basin is computed in parallel, and section runoff of sub basin is integrated, Flood forecasting in the whole basin is realized. To explain and verify the proposed method, four hydrological monitoring stations (Wuying, Yixin, Xlin and Chenming) are selected in Yichun river system of Tangwang River Basin divide the Yichun river system into 5 sub-basins.

These trends emphasize the need of accurate medium- to long-term predictions to timely prompt anticipatory operations. Despite in some locations global climate oscillations and particularly the El Nino Southern Oscillation (ENSO) may contribute to extending forecast lead times, in other regions there is no consensus on how ENSO can be detected, and used as local conditions are also influenced by other concurrent climate signals. In this work, we introduce the Climate State Intelligence framework to capture the state of multiple global climate signals via artificial intelligence and improve seasonal forecasts. These forecasts are used as additional inputs for informing water system operations and their value is quantified as the corresponding gain in system performance. We apply the framework to the Lake Como basin, a regulated lake in northern Italy mainly operated for flood control and irrigation supply. Numerical results show the existence of notable teleconnection patterns dependent on both ENSO and the North Atlantic Oscillation over the Alpine region, which contribute in generating skilful seasonal precipitation and hydrologic forecasts. The use of this information for conditioning the lake operations produces an average 44% improvement in system performance with respect to a baseline solution not informed by any forecast, with this gain that further increases during extreme drought episodes. Our results also suggest that observed preseason sea surface temperature anomalies appear more valuable than hydrologic-based seasonal forecasts, producing an average 59% improvement in system performance.","[Giuliani, Matteo; Zaniolo, Marta; Castelletti, Andrea] Politecn Milan, Dept Elect Informat & Bioengn, Milan, Italy; [Davoli, Guido] Ca Foscari Univ, Dept Econ, Venice, Italy; [Davoli, Guido] Ctr Euromediterraneo Cambiamenti Climatici CMCC, Bologna, Italy; [Block, Paul] Univ Wisconsin, Dept Civil & Environm Engn, Madison, WI 53706 USA",,"Giuliani, M (corresponding author), Politecn Milan, Dept Elect Informat & Bioengn, Milan, Italy.",matteo.giuliani@polimi.it,"Castelletti, Andrea/AAG-7111-2020","Davoli, Guido/0000-0002-7680-8319; Castelletti, Andrea/0000-0002-7923-1498; Giuliani, Matteo/0000-0002-4780-9347",,,,86,20,20,5,39,AMER GEOPHYSICAL UNION,WASHINGTON,"2000 FLORIDA AVE NW, WASHINGTON, DC 20009 USA",0043-1397,1944-7973,,WATER RESOUR RES,Water Resour.

This is particularly true for zoonotic diseases that infect humans, agricultural animals, and wildlife. Within the subset of zoonoses, vector-borne pathogens are changing more rapidly with climate change, and have a complex epidemiology, which may allow them to take advantage of a changing environment. Most mosquito-borne infectious diseases are transmitted by mosquitoes in three genera: Aedes, Anopheles, and Culex, and the expansion of these genera is well documented. There is an urgent need to study vector-borne diseases in response to climate change and to produce a generalizable approach capable of generating risk maps and forecasting outbreaks. Here, we provide a strategy for coupling climate and epidemiological models for zoonotic infectious diseases. We discuss the complexity and challenges of data and model fusion, baseline requirements for data, and animal and human population movement. Disease forecasting needs significant investment to build the infrastructure necessary to collect data about the environment, vectors, and hosts at all spatial and temporal resolutions. These investments can contribute to building a modeling community around the globe to support public health officials so as to reduce disease burden through forecasts with quantified uncertainty.","[Bartlow, Andrew W.; Fair, Jeanne M.] Los Alamos Natl Lab, Biosecur & Publ Hlth, Los Alamos, NM 87545 USA; [Manore, Carrie; Del Valle, Sara; Fairchild, Geoffrey] Los Alamos Natl Lab, Informat Syst & Modeling, Los Alamos, NM 87545 USA; [Xu, Chonggang] Los Alamos Natl Lab, Earth Syst Observat, Los Alamos, NM 87545 USA; [Kaufeld, Kimberly A.] Los Alamos Natl Lab, Stat Sci, Los Alamos, NM 87545 USA; [Ziemann, Amanda] Los Alamos Natl Lab, Space Data Sci & Syst, Los Alamos, NM 87545 USA",,"Fair, JM (corresponding author), Los Alamos Natl Lab, Biosecur & Publ Hlth, Los Alamos, NM 87545 USA.",abartlow@lanl.gov; cmanore@lanl.gov; cxu@lanl.gov; kkaufeld@lanl.gov; sdelvall@lanl.gov; ziemann@lanl.gov; gfairchild@lanl.gov; jmfair@lanl.gov,"Del Valle, Sara/AAG-5148-2021; Bartlow, Andrew W./J-5435-2019","Del Valle, Sara/0000-0002-0159-1952; Bartlow, Andrew W./0000-0002-1254-4481; Fairchild, Geoffrey/0000-0001-5500-8120; Fair, Jeanne/0000-0002-3377-6134",Laboratory Directed Research Development Program at Los Alamos National Laboratory; U.S. Department of EnergyUnited States Department of Energy (DOE) [89233218CNA000001]; Los Alamos Director's Postdoctoral Fellowship,"This research was funded by the Laboratory Directed Research Development Program at Los Alamos National Laboratory.

In order to improve the accuracy of short-term runoff forecasting, a hybrid model-based feature decomposition-learning reconstruction named VMD-DBN-IPSO was proposed. In this paper, variational mode decomposition (VMD) is first used to decompose the original daily runoff series into a set of sub-sequence for improving the frequency resolution. Partial autocorrelation function (PACF) is then applied to determine the input variables of each sub-sequence. The improved particle swarm optimization (IPSO) algorithm is combined with the deep belief network (DBN) model to predict each sub-sequences and finally reconstruct the ensemble forecasting result. Three quantitative evaluation indicators, mean absolute error (MAE), root mean square error (RMSE) and Nash-Sutcliffe efficiency coefficient (NSE), were used to evaluate and compare the established models using the historical daily runoff data (1/1/1988-31/12/2017) at Yangxian and Ankang hydrological station in the Han River Basin of China. Meanwhile, a comparative analysis of the performance of VMD-DBN-IPSO model under different forecast periods (1-, 3-, 5- and 7-day lead time) was performed. In addition, the prediction ability of peak runoff of the VMD-DBN-IPSO model is further verified by analyzing the 10 peak flows during the testing data-series. The results indicate that the VMD-DBN-IPSO model can always achieve the best performance in the training and testing stage, and has good stability and representativeness, the NSE coefficient remains above 0.8, and the prediction error of peak flow is within 20%. It is a preferred data-driven tool for forecasting daily runoff.","[Xie, Tuo; Zhang, Gang; Hou, Jinwang; Xie, Jiancang; Lv, Meng] Xian Univ Technol, State Key Lab Ecohydraul Northwest Arid Reg China, Xian 710048, Shaanxi, Peoples R China; [Zhang, Gang; Xie, Jiancang] Xian Univ Technol, Res Ctr Ecohydraul & Sustainable Dev, New Style Think Tank Shaanxi Univ, Xian 710048, Shaanxi, Peoples R China; [Liu, Fuchao] State Grid Gansu Elect Power Co, Gansu Elect Power Res Inst, Lanzhou 730050, Gansu, Peoples R China",,"Zhang, G (corresponding author), Xian Univ Technol, State Key Lab Ecohydraul Northwest Arid Reg China, Xian 710048, Shaanxi, Peoples R China.; Zhang, G (corresponding author), Xian Univ Technol, Res Ctr Ecohydraul & Sustainable Dev, New Style Think Tank Shaanxi Univ, Xian 710048, Shaanxi, Peoples R China.",xtxaut6863@aliyun.com; zhanggang3463003@163.com; liufc8127@sina.com,,,"National Key Research and Development Program of China [2016YFC0401409]; National Natural Science Foundation of ChinaNational Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC) [51507141, 51679188, 71774132]; Key Research and Development Plan of Shaanxi Province [2018-ZDCXL-GY-10-04]","This research was funded by the National Key Research and Development Program of China, grant number 2016YFC0401409, and the National Natural Science Foundation of China under grant 51507141, 51679188, 71774132, and the Key Research and Development Plan of Shaanxi Province, grant number 2018-ZDCXL-GY-10-04.

In this research, we have employed satellite data and a stochastic approach for forecasting the changes in lake surface areas and demonstrated for the application of the new technique for the case study of the Lake Gregory in Australia. High-resolution Landsat satellite images are used on a monthly time scale from Landsat 5, 7, and 8, on days that are not cloudy. The software ENVI 5.3, using normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI), and modify normalized difference water index (MNDWI) indices were employed to obtain the lake surface maps, and satellite images have been split into water and non-water using a decision tree. The ArcGIS 10.3 software was used to calculate the area of the Lake monthly. The overall trend data shows that from 2004 to 2019, the LS is steadily declining, reaching its lowest area in 2019.The TRMM satellite monthly precipitation (P) and temperature (T) measurement were obtained to investigate the correlation between these changes and regional precipitation. We developed a novel generalized group method of data handling (GGMDH) to forecast lake surface (LS) fluctuations, in which the LS time-series database is extracted from the satellite imagery. For downscaling, precipitation and three different scenarios are defined based on climate change projections to forecast the LS in the 2020-2060 period. The comparison of the GGMDH with stochastic models integrated with preprocessing scenarios indicates the GGMDH in long-term LS forecasting outperforms the stochastic model. The result showed GGMDH is the best model among other ones to modeling lake surface by R-2 (%) = 94.16, RMSE = 8.77 for the forecasting stage.

The artificial intelligence (AI) algorithm is generally used for stochastic forecasting rainfall which is not capable to simulate unseen extreme rainfall events which become common due to climate change. A new model is developed in this study for prediction of daily rainfall for different lead times based on sea level pressure (SLP) which is physically related to rainfall on land and thus able to predict unseen rainfall events. Daily rainfall of east coast of Peninsular Malaysia (PM) was predicted using SLP data over the climate domain. Five advanced AI algorithms such as extreme learning machine (ELM), Bayesian regularized neural networks (BRNNs), Bayesian additive regression trees (BART), extreme gradient boosting (xgBoost), and hybrid neural fuzzy inference system (HNFIS) were used considering the complex relationship of rainfall with sea level pressure. Principle components of SLP domain correlated with daily rainfall were used as predictors. The results revealed that the efficacy of AI models is predicting daily rainfall one day before. The relative performance of the models revealed the higher performance of BRNN with normalized root mean square error (NRMSE) of 0.678 compared with HNFIS (NRMSE = 0.708), BART (NRMSE = 0.784), xgBoost (NRMSE = 0.803), and ELM (NRMSE = 0.915). Visual inspection of predicted rainfall during model validation using density-scatter plot and other novel ways of visual comparison revealed the ability of BRNN to predict daily rainfall one day before reliably.","[Ye, Lu] Baoji Univ Arts & Sci, Sch Comp Sci, Baoji 721007, Peoples R China; [Jabbar, Saadya Fahad] Univ Baghdad, Coll Educ Human Sci Ibn Rushed, Baghdad, Iraq; [Abdul Zahra, Musaddak M.] Al Mustaqbal Univ Coll, Comp Tech Engn Dept, Hillah 51001, Babil, Iraq; [Abdul Zahra, Musaddak M.] Univ Babylon, Coll Engn, Elect Engn Dept, Hilla, Babil, Iraq; [Tan, Mou Leong] Univ Sains Malaysia, Sch Humanities, Geoinformat Unit,Geog Sect, Usm 11800, Pulau Pinang, Malaysia",,"Tan, ML (corresponding author), Univ Sains Malaysia, Sch Humanities, Geoinformat Unit,Geog Sect, Usm 11800, Pulau Pinang, Malaysia.",luye528@126.com; saadya.fahad@ircoedu.uobaghdad.edu.iq; musaddaqmahir@mustaqbal-college.edu.iq; mouleong@usm.my,"Tan, Mou Leong/N-4678-2017; Abdul Zahra, Musaddak Maher/AAP-6574-2021","Tan, Mou Leong/0000-0003-3939-0336; Abdul Zahra, Musaddak Maher/0000-0002-5879-6991","Ministry of Higher Education MalaysiaMinistry of Education, Malaysia [203.PHUMANITI.6711695]; USM Publication Fund; Science and Technology Plan Project of Shaanxi Province [2020GY-041]; Doctoral Research Initiation Project [209040080]","This research was funded by the Ministry of Higher Education Malaysia under the Fundamental Research Grant Scheme, (203.PHUMANITI.6711695) and the USM Publication Fund.

The lack of adequate monitoring networks, especially in developing countries prevents near real-time flood prediction that could help to reduce the loss of lives and economic damages. In the last few years, increasing availability of multi-satellite sensors induced to develop new techniques for retrieving river discharge and especially in supporting discharge nowcasting and forecasting activities. Recently, the potential of radar altimetry to estimate water levels and discharge in ungauged river sites with good accuracy has been demonstrated. However, the considerable benefit derived from this technique is attenuated by the low revisit time of the satellite (10 or 35 days, depending on the satellite mission) causing delays on the predicting operations. For this reason, sensors with a higher temporal resolution such as the MODerate resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS), working in visible/Infra-Red bands, can support flood forecasting. In this study, we performed the forecast of river discharge by using MODIS and we compared it with the radar altimetry and in-situ data along the Niger-Benue River in Nigeria to develop an operational flood forecasting scheme that could help in rapid emergency response and decision making processes. In the first step, four MODIS products (daily and, 8-day from the TERRA and AQUA satellites) at two gauged sites were used for discharge estimation. Secondly, the capability of remote sensing sensors to forecast discharge a few days (similar to 4 days) in advance at a downstream section using MODIS is analyzed and also compared with the one obtained by the use of radar altimetry by ENVISAT and Jason-2. The results confirmed the capability of the MODIS data to estimate river discharge with performance indices >0.97 and 0.95 in terms of coefficient of correlation and Nash Sutcliffe efficiency. In particular, RMSE does not exceed 1300 m(3)/s and the fractional RMSE ranges between 0.15 and 0.23. For the forecasting exercise, both altimetry and MODIS provide satisfactory results with positive coefficient of persistence considering 4 days of lead time (>0.34). Although altimetry was found to be more accurate in the forecasting of river discharge (RMSE similar to 350 m(3)/s), the much higher temporal resolution of MODIS guarantees a continuity that is more suitable to address operational activities.

Periodograms, containing cyclic patterns, were obtained using Fourier analysis. Significant oscillations were determined with Fisher-Whittle' s tests and residuals were calculated after subtracting these significant oscillations from the original signals. Autoregressive moving average (ARMA) models of residuals were finally applied. Results indicated that river water levels, and especially those in May, greatly explained the fluctuations of Pontic shad catch. Annual landings varied greatly and appeared to be cyclic. Varying river flow was considered to be one of the most important factors that cause fluctuations in the size of populations.

This project uses integrated hydrometeorological assessment methods to investigate the utility of the NWM to predict catastrophic flooding associated with an extreme rainfall event that occurred in Ellicott City, Maryland, on 27-28 May 2018. Short-range forecasts (0-18-h lead time) from the NWM version 1.2 are explored, focusing on the quantitative precipitation forecast (QPF) forcing from the High-Resolution Rapid Refresh (HRRR) model and the corresponding NWM streamflow forecast. A comprehensive assessment of multiscale hydrometeorological processes are considered using a combination of object-based, grid-based, and hydrologic point-based verification. Results highlight the benefits and risks of using a distributed hydrologic modeling tool such as the NWM to connect operational CONUS-scale atmospheric forcings to local impact predictions. For the Ellicott City event, reasonably skillful QPF in several HRRR model forecast cycles produced NWM streamflow forecasts in the small Ellicott City basin that were suggestive of flash flood potential. In larger surrounding basins, the NWM streamflow response was more complex, and errors were found to be governed by both hydrologic process representation, as well as forcing errors. The integrated, hydrometeorological multiscale analysis method demonstrated here guides both research and ongoing model development efforts, along with providing user education and engagement to ultimately engender improved flash flood prediction.","[Viterbo, Francesca] Univ Colorado, CIRES, Boulder, CO 80309 USA; [Viterbo, Francesca; Mahoney, Kelly; Cifelli, Robert] NOAA, Phys Sci Div, Boulder, CO 80305 USA; [Read, Laura; Dugger, Aubrey; Gochis, David] Natl Ctr Atmospher Res, POB 3000, Boulder, CO 80307 USA; [Salas, Fernando] NOAA, Natl Water Ctr, Tuscaloosa, AL USA; [Bates, Bradford] NOAA, Lynker Technol, Natl Water Ctr, Tuscaloosa, AL USA; [Elliott, Jason] Natl Weather Serv, Baltimore Washington Forecast Off, Sterling, VA USA; [Cosgrove, Brian] NOAA, Off Hydrol Dev, Natl Weather Serv, Silver Spring, MD USA",,"Viterbo, F (corresponding author), Univ Colorado, CIRES, Boulder, CO 80309 USA.; Viterbo, F (corresponding author), NOAA, Phys Sci Div, Boulder, CO 80305 USA.",francesca.viterbo@noaa.gov,"VITERBO, FRANCESCA/AAQ-9533-2020",,Physical Sciences Division of the NOAA Earth System Research Laboratory; National Science FoundationNational Science Foundation (NSF),"This study was supported by the Physical Sciences Division of the NOAA Earth System Research Laboratory.

However, the systematic evaluation of forecast value or usefulness for better decision-making is less frequent, even if it is also essential to guide strategic planning and investments. In the hydropower sector, several operational systems use medium-range hydrometeorological forecasts (up to 7-10 d ahead) and energy price predictions as input to models that optimize hydropower production. The operation of hydropower systems, including the management of water stored in reservoirs, is thus partially impacted by weather and hydrological conditions. Forecast value can be quantified by the economic gains obtained with the optimization of operations informed by the forecasts. In order to assess how much improving the quality of hydrometeorological forecasts will improve their economic value, it is essential to understand how the system and its optimization model are sensitive to sequences of input forecasts of different quality. This paper investigates the impact of 7 d streamflow forecasts of different quality on the management of hydroelectric reservoirs and the economic gains generated from a linear programming optimization model. The study is based on a conceptual approach. Flows from 10 catchments in France are synthetically generated over a 4-year period to obtain forecasts of different quality in terms of accuracy and reliability. These forecasts define the inflows to 10 hydroelectric reservoirs, which are conceptually parameterized. Relationships between forecast quality and economic value (hydropower revenue) show that forecasts with a recurrent positive bias (overestimation) and low accuracy generate the highest economic losses when compared to the reference management system where forecasts are equal to observed inflows. The smallest losses are observed for forecast systems with underdispersion reliability bias, while forecast systems with negative bias (underestimation) show intermediate losses. Overall, the losses (which amount to millions of Euros) represent approximately 1% to 3% of the revenue over the study period. Besides revenue, the quality of the forecasts also impacts spillage, stock evolution, production hours and production rates, with systematic over- and underestimations being able to generate some extreme reservoir management situations.","[Cassagnole, Manon; Ramos, Maria-Helena; Zalachori, Ioanna; Thirel, Guillaume] Univ Paris Saclay, INRAE, UR HYCAR, 1 Rue Pierre Gilles de Gennes, F-92160 Antony, France; [Garcon, Remy; Gailhard, Joel] EDF DTG, Elect France, Div Tech Gen, Grenoble, France; [Ouillon, Thomas] Paris Saclay, EDF Lab, Elect France, Paris, France; [Zalachori, Ioanna] TERNA ENERGY, Hydroelect Projects Dept, Athens, Greece",,"Ramos, MH (corresponding author), Univ Paris Saclay, INRAE, UR HYCAR, 1 Rue Pierre Gilles de Gennes, F-92160 Antony, France.",maria-helena.ramos@inrae.fr,"Thirel, Guillaume/AAA-4381-2021; Thirel, Guillaume/B-1580-2013","Thirel, Guillaume/0000-0002-1444-1830; Thirel, Guillaume/0000-0002-1444-1830; Ramos, Maria-Helena/0000-0003-1133-4164",European UnionEuropean Commission [641811],"The authors Manon Cassagnole, MariaHelena Ramos and Guillaume Thirel received funding from the European Union's Horizon 2020 research and innovation program under grant agreement no. 641811 (IMPREX project).",,62,2,2,3,5,COPERNICUS GESELLSCHAFT MBH,GOTTINGEN,"BAHNHOFSALLEE 1E, GOTTINGEN, 37081, GERMANY",1027-5606,1607-7938,,HYDROL EARTH SYST SC,Hydrol.

Within this framework, the forecasting of the proxy of chlorophyll a in coastal areas is the first step to managing these algal blooms. The primary goal was to analyze how phytoplankton bloom forecasts are impacted by different sampling frequencies, by using a machine learning model. The database used in this study was sourced from an automated system located in the English Channel. This device has a sampling frequency of 20 min. We considered 12 physicochemical parameters over a six-year period. Our forecast methodology is based on the random forest (RF) model and a sliding window strategy. The lag times for these sliding windows ranged from 12 h to 3 months with four different sampling times until 1 day. The results indicate that the optimal forecast was obtained for a 20 min time step, with an average R-2 of 0.62. Moreover, the highest values of fluorescence were predicted when the water temperature was approximately 11.8 degrees C. Consequently, we demonstrated that the sampling frequency directly impacts the forecast performance of an RF model. Furthermore, this kind of model can recreate interactions that closely resemble biological processes. Our study suggests that the RF model can utilize the additional information contained in high-frequency datasets. The methodology presented here lays the foundation for the development of a numerical decision-making tool that could help mitigate the impact of these algal blooms.","[Derot, Jonathan; Yajima, Hiroshi] Shimane Univ, Estuary Res Ctr, 1060 Nishikawatsu Cho, Matsue, Shimane 6908504, Japan; [Schmitt, Francois G.] Univ Lille, Univ Littoral Cote Opale, Lab Oceanol & Geosci, LOG,UMR 8187,CNRS, F-62930 Wimereux, France",,"Derot, J (corresponding author), Shimane Univ, Estuary Res Ctr, 1060 Nishikawatsu Cho, Matsue, Shimane 6908504, Japan.",j.derot@soc.shimane-u.ac.jp,"Yajima, Hiroshi/AAE-1959-2021",,"Japan Society for the Promotion of Science (JSPS)Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology, Japan (MEXT)Japan Society for the Promotion of Science",This research was funded by a grant from the Japan Society for the Promotion of Science (JSPS).

Decomposition-based approaches have particularly demonstrated improved forecasting performance. However, direct decomposition of entire streamflow data with calibration and validation subsets is not practical for signal component prediction. This impracticality is due to the fact that the calibration process uses some validation information that is not available in practical streamflow forecasting. Unfortunately, independent decomposition of calibration and validation sets leads to undesirable boundary effects and less accurate forecasting. To alleviate such boundary effects and improve the forecasting performance in basins lacking meteorological observations, we propose a two-stage decomposition prediction (TSDP) framework. We realize this framework using variational mode decomposition (VMD) and support vector regression (SVR) and refer to this realization as VMD-SVR. We demonstrate experimentally the effectiveness, efficiency and accuracy of the TSDP framework and its VMD-SVR realization in terms of the boundary effect reduction, computational cost, and overfitting, in addition to decomposition and forecasting outcomes for different lead times. Specifically, four comparative experiments were conducted based on the ensemble empirical mode decomposition (EEMD), singular spectrum analysis (SSA), discrete wavelet transform (DWT), boundary-corrected maximal overlap discrete wavelet transform (BCMODWT), autoregressive integrated moving average (ARIMA), SVR, backpropagation neural network (BPNN) and long short-term memory (LSTM). The TSDP framework was also compared with the wavelet data-driven forecasting framework (WDDFF). Results of experiments on monthly runoff data collected from three stations at the Wei River show the superiority of the VMD-SVR model compared to benchmark models.","[Zuo, Ganggang; Luo, Jungang; Wang, Ni; Lian, Yani; He, Xinxin] Xian Univ Technol, State Key Lab Ecohydraul Northwest Arid Reg, Xian 710048, Shaanxi, Peoples R China",,"Luo, JG; Wang, N (corresponding author), Xian Univ Technol, State Key Lab Ecohydraul Northwest Arid Reg, Xian 710048, Shaanxi, Peoples R China.",jgluo@xaut.edu.cn; wangni@xaut.edu.cn,"Zuo, Ganggang/AAL-3458-2021","Zuo, Ganggang/0000-0002-6364-3586","National Natural Science Foundation of ChinaNational Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC) [51679186, 51679188, 51979221, 51709222]; National Key R&D Program of China [2016YFC0401409]; Research Fund of the State Key Laboratory of Eco-hydraulics in Northwest Arid Region, Xi'an University of Technology [2019KJCXTD-5]; Natural Science Basic Research Program of Shaanxi [2019JLZ-15]","This research has been supported by the National Natural Science Foundation of China (grant nos. 51679186, 51679188, 51979221, and 51709222), the National Key R&D Program of China (grant no. 2016YFC0401409), the Research Fund of the State Key Laboratory of Eco-hydraulics in Northwest Arid Region, Xi'an University of Technology (grant no. 2019KJCXTD-5), and the Natural Science Basic Research Program of Shaanxi (grant no. 2019JLZ-15).",,79,13,13,20,39,COPERNICUS GESELLSCHAFT MBH,GOTTINGEN,"BAHNHOFSALLEE 1E, GOTTINGEN, 37081, GERMANY",1027-5606,1607-7938,,HYDROL EARTH SYST SC,Hydrol.

We developed data-driven models that rely on spatiotemporal remote sensing and field data to identify factors controlling HAB propagation, provide a same-day distribution (nowcasting), and forecast their occurrences up to three days in advance. We constructed multivariate regression models using historical HAB occurrences (213 events reported from January 2010 to October 2017) compiled by the Florida Fish and Wildlife Conservation Commission and validated the models against a subset (20%) of the historical events. The models were designed to capture the onset of the HABs instead of those that developed days earlier and continued thereafter. A prototype of an early warning system was developed through a threefold exercise. The first step involved the automatic downloading and processing of daily Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) Aqua products using SeaDAS ocean color processing software to extract temporal and spatial variations of remote sensing-based variables over the study area. The second step involved the development of a multivariate regression model for same-day mapping of HABs and similar subsequent models for forecasting HAB occurrences one, two, and three days in advance. Eleven remote sensing variables and two non-remote sensing variables were used as inputs for the generated models. In the third and final step, model outputs (same-day and forecasted distribution of HABs) were posted automatically on a web map. Our findings include: (1) the variables most indicative of the timing of bloom propagation are bathymetry, euphotic depth, wind direction, sea surface temperature (SST), ocean chlorophyll three-band algorithm for MODIS [chlorophyll-a OC3M] and distance from the river mouth, and (2) the model predictions were 90% successful for same-day mapping and 65%, 72% and 71% for the one-, two- and three-day advance predictions, respectively. The adopted methodologies are reliable at a local scale, dependent on readily available remote sensing data, and cost-effective and thus could potentially be used to map and forecast algal bloom occurrences in data-scarce regions.","[Karki, Sita; Sultan, Mohamed] Western Michigan Univ, Dept Geol & Environm Sci, Kalamazoo, MI 49008 USA; [Elkadiri, Racha] Middle Tennessee State Univ, Dept Geosci, Murfreesboro, TN 37132 USA; [Elbayoumi, Tamer] Mansoura Univ, Dept Appl Stat & Insurance, Mansoura 35516, Egypt; [Elbayoumi, Tamer] Indiana Univ, Dept Stat, Bloomington, IN 47405 USA",,"Sultan, M (corresponding author), Western Michigan Univ, Dept Geol & Environm Sci, Kalamazoo, MI 49008 USA.",sita.karki@wmich.edu; mohamed.sultan@wmich.edu; racha.elkadiri@mtsu.edu; telbayou@iu.edu,"Elbayoumi, Tamer M/P-1871-2017; Elbayoumi, Tamer/N-9846-2019; Karki, Sita/Y-8414-2019; Elbayoumi, Tamer/AAU-4211-2021","Elbayoumi, Tamer M/0000-0001-9071-7766; Elbayoumi, Tamer/0000-0001-9071-7766; Karki, Sita/0000-0002-9548-8998; Elbayoumi, Tamer/0000-0001-9071-7766",Enterprise Charlotte Foundation; Western Michigan University,This project was supported through Enterprise Charlotte Foundation and Western Michigan University.,,108,14,15,4,42,MDPI,BASEL,"ST ALBAN-ANLAGE 66, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND",2072-4292,,,REMOTE SENS-BASEL,Remote Sens.,OCT,2018,10,10,,,,,,,1656,10.3390/rs10101656,,,19,"Environmental Sciences; Geosciences, Multidisciplinary; Remote Sensing; Imaging Science & Photographic Technology",Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),Environmental Sciences & Ecology; Geology; Remote Sensing; Imaging Science & Photographic Technology,GY4SZ,WOS:000448555800156,,"Green Submitted, gold",,,2022-02-17

To cope with this challenge, two efforts could be made; one is to improve the model's computation efficiency in a large watershed, the other is implementing the model on a highperformance supercomputer. This study sets up a physically based distributed hydrological model for flood forecasting of the Liujiang River basin in south China. Terrain data digital elevation model (DEM), soil and land use are downloaded from the website freely, and the model structure with a high resolution of 200m x 200m grid cell is set up. The initial model parameters are derived from the terrain property data, and then optimized by using the Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) algorithm; the model is used to simulate 29 observed flood events. It has been found that by dividing the river channels into virtual channel sections and assuming the cross section shapes as trapezoid, the Liuxihe model largely increases computation efficiency while keeping good model performance, thus making it applicable in larger watersheds. This study also finds that parameter uncertainty exists for physically deriving model parameters, and parameter optimization could reduce this uncertainty, and is highly recommended. Computation time needed for running a distributed hydrological model increases exponentially at a power of 2, not linearly with the increasing of model spatial resolution, and the 200m x 200m model resolution is proposed for modeling the Liujiang River basin flood with the Liuxihe model in this study. To keep the model with an acceptable performance, minimum model spatial resolution is needed. The suggested threshold model spatial resolution for modeling the Liujiang River basin flood is a 500m x 500m grid cell, but the model spatial resolution with a 200m x 200m grid cell is recommended in this study to keep the model at a better performance.","[Chen, Yangbo; Li, Ji; Wang, Huanyu; Qin, Jianming; Dong, Liming] Sun Yat Sen Univ, Dept Water Resources & Environm, Guangzhou 510275, Guangdong, Peoples R China",,"Chen, YB (corresponding author), Sun Yat Sen Univ, Dept Water Resources & Environm, Guangzhou 510275, Guangdong, Peoples R China.",eescyb@mail.sysu.edu.cn,,"Chen, Yangbo/0000-0003-4445-2933; Li, Ji/0000-0003-2267-0454",Special Research Grant for the Water Resources Industry [201301070]; National Science Foundation of ChinaNational Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC) [50479033]; Basic Research Grant for Universities of the Ministry of Education of China [13lgjc01],"This study is supported by the Special Research Grant for the Water Resources Industry (funding no. 201301070), the National Science Foundation of China (funding no. 50479033), and the Basic Research Grant for Universities of the Ministry of Education of China (funding no. 13lgjc01).",,64,29,30,7,30,COPERNICUS GESELLSCHAFT MBH,GOTTINGEN,"BAHNHOFSALLEE 1E, GOTTINGEN, 37081, GERMANY",1027-5606,1607-7938,,HYDROL EARTH SYST SC,Hydrol.

Each of these experiments uses 2000 time series generated by linear stationary stochastic processes. We conduct each simulation experiment twice; the first time using time series of 100 values and the second time using time series of 300 values. Additionally, we conduct a real-world experiment using 405 mean annual river discharge time series of 100 values. We quantify the forecasting performance of the methods using 18 metrics. The results indicate that stochastic and ML methods may produce equally useful forecasts.","[Papacharalampous, Georgia; Koutsoyiannis, Demetris] Natl Tech Univ Athens, Sch Civil Engn, Dept Water Resources & Environm Engn, Iroon Polytechniou 5, Zografos 15780, Greece; [Tyralis, Hristos] Hellen Air Force, Air Force Support Command, Elefsina Air Base 19200, Elefsina, Greece",,"Papacharalampous, G (corresponding author), Natl Tech Univ Athens, Sch Civil Engn, Dept Water Resources & Environm Engn, Iroon Polytechniou 5, Zografos 15780, Greece.",papacharalampous.georgia@gmail.com; montchrister@gmail.com; dk@itia.ntua.gr,"Tyralis, Hristos/A-1480-2019; Papacharalampous, Georgia/A-6617-2019; Koutsoyiannis, Demetris/B-7400-2009","Tyralis, Hristos/0000-0002-8932-4997; Papacharalampous, Georgia/0000-0001-5446-954X; Koutsoyiannis, Demetris/0000-0002-6226-0241",,,,167,51,51,5,43,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"ONE NEW YORK PLAZA, SUITE 4600, NEW YORK, NY, UNITED STATES",1436-3240,1436-3259,,STOCH ENV RES RISK A,Stoch.

GCM forecasts typically require postprocessing to reduce biases and improve reliability; however, current seasonal postprocessing methods often ignore multivariate dependence. In low-dimensional settings, fully parametric methods may sufficiently model intervariable covariance. On the other hand, empirical ensemble reordering techniques can inject desired multivariate dependence in ensembles from template data after univariate postprocessing. To investigate the best approach for seasonal forecasting, this study develops and tests several strategies for calibrating seasonal GCM forecasts of rainfall, minimum temperature, and maximum temperature with intervariable dependence: 1) simultaneous calibration of multiple climate variables using the Bayesian joint probability modeling approach; 2) univariate BJP calibration coupled with an ensemble reordering method (the Schaake shuffle); and 3) transformation-based quantile mapping, which borrows intervariable dependence from the raw forecasts. Applied to Australian seasonal forecasts from the ECMWF System4 model, univariate calibration paired with empirical ensemble reordering performs best in terms of univariate and multivariate forecast verification metrics, including the energy and variogram scores. However, the performance of empirical ensemble reordering using the Schaake shuffle is influenced by the selection of historical data in constructing a dependence template. Direct multivariate calibration is the second-best method, with its far superior performance in in-sample testing vanishing in cross validation, likely because of insufficient data relative to the number of parameters. The continued development of multivariate forecast calibration methods will support the uptake of seasonal climate forecasts in complex application domains such as agriculture and hydrology.","[Schepen, Andrew] CSIRO Land & Water, Brisbane, Qld, Australia; [Schepen, Andrew; Everingham, Yvette] James Cook Univ, Townsville, Qld, Australia; [Wang, Quan J.] Univ Melbourne, Melbourne, Vic, Australia",,"Schepen, A (corresponding author), CSIRO Land & Water, Brisbane, Qld, Australia.; Schepen, A (corresponding author), James Cook Univ, Townsville, Qld, Australia.",andrew.schepen@csiro.au,"Schepen, Andrew/AAG-8880-2020; Wang, Quan J/D-2674-2012","Schepen, Andrew/0000-0002-6372-735X; Wang, Quan J/0000-0002-8787-2738",,,,58,7,7,1,15,AMER METEOROLOGICAL SOC,BOSTON,"45 BEACON ST, BOSTON, MA 02108-3693 USA",0027-0644,1520-0493,,MON WEATHER REV,Mon.

In this paper, Deep Learning (DL) hybrid models (i.e., CEEMDAN-CNN-GRU) are designed for daily time-step surface soil moisture (SSM) forecasts, employing the gated recurrent unit (GRU), complete ensemble empirical mode decomposition with adaptive noise (CEEMDAN), and convolutional neural network (CNN). To establish the objective model's viability for SSM forecasting at multi-step daily horizons, the hybrid CEEMDAN-CNN-GRU model is tested at 1st, 5th, 7th, 14th, 21st, and 30th day ahead period by assimilating a comprehensive pool of 52 predictor dataset obtained from three distinct data sources. Data comprise satellite-derived Global Land Data Assimilation System (GLDAS) repository a global, high-temporal resolution, unique terrestrial modelling system, and ground-based variables from Scientific Information Landowners (SILO) and synoptic-scale climate indices. The results demonstrate the forecasting capability of the hybrid CEEMDAN-CNN-GRU model with respect to the counterpart comparative models. This is supported by a relatively lower value of the mean absolute percentage and root mean square error. In terms of the statistical score metrics and infographics employed to test the final model's utility, the proposed CEEMDAN-CNN-GRU models are considerably superior compared to a standalone and other hybrid method tested on independent SSM data developed through feature selection approaches. Thus, the proposed approach can be successfully implemented in hydrology and agriculture management.","[Ahmed, A. A.

The results indicate that GXM is capable of producing improved flood predictions by using the WRF precipitation forecasts. The incoming floods are difficult to be predicted in advance by using the gauge-measured precipitation, especially when the lead time is larger than the flow concentration time. However, with the WRF forecasts, the occurrence of flood events can be predicted for longer lead times.

We demonstrated that seasonal forecasts can be used to optimize water resources management and increase supply. Using El Nino Southern Oscillation (ENSO) to forecast the wet seasons (winter and summer) can provide information during extreme ENSO. We found that ENSO is a better indicator for dryer than normal winters during La Nina and dryer than normal summers during El Nino. As in indicator of wetter than normal seasons (i.e. El Nino and La Nina in the winter and summer, respectively) ENSO is often not a consistent predictor and moreover, on several occasions the wetter than normal rainfall did not yield above normal seasonal flows. We also examined the seasonal precipitation forecasts for the region from the Climate Forecast System (CFS). The CFS showed reasonable predictive skill for the winter that extends up to four months lead-time. The only CFS skill for forecasting summer rainfall was observed for predicting above normal rainfall in July with one month lead-time. Seasonal forecasts can substantially improve water resources management but currently requires considerations of large uncertainties in the operationally available forecasts. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

This paper evaluated the potential of the weather research and forecasting (WRF) model and its three-dimensional data assimilation (3DVar) module in improving the accuracy of rainfall-runoff prediction through coupled atmospheric-hydrologic systems. The WRF model with the assimilation of radar reflectivity and conventional surface and upper-air observations provided the improved initial and boundary conditions for the hydrological process; subsequently, three atmospheric-hydrological systems with variable complexity were established by coupling WRF with a lumped, a grid-based Hebei model, and the WRF-Hydro modeling system. Four storm events with different spatial and temporal rainfall distribution from mountainous catchments of northern China were chosen as the study objects. The assimilation results showed a general improvement in the accuracy of rainfall accumulation, with low root mean square error and high correlation coefficients compared to the results without assimilation. The coupled atmospheric-hydrologic systems also provide more accurate flood forecasts, which depend upon the complexity of the coupled hydrological models. The grid-based Hebei system provided the most stable forecasts regardless of whether homogeneous or inhomogeneous rainfall was considered. Flood peaks before assimilation were underestimated more in the lumped Hebei model relative to the other coupling systems considered, and the model seems more applicable for homogeneous temporal and spatial events. WRF-Hydro did not exhibit desirable predictions of rapid flood process recession. This may reflect increasing infiltration due to the interaction of atmospheric and land surface hydrology at each integration, resulting in mismatched solutions for local runoff generation and confluence.","[Wang, Wei; Liu, Jia; Li, Chuanzhe; Liu, Yuchen; Yu, Fuliang] China Inst Water Resources & Hydropower Res, State Key Lab Simulat & Regulat Water Cycle River, Beijing 100038, Peoples R China; [Wang, Wei] Hohai Univ, Coll Hydrol & Water Resources, Nanjing 210098, Peoples R China",,"Liu, J (corresponding author), China Inst Water Resources & Hydropower Res, State Key Lab Simulat & Regulat Water Cycle River, Beijing 100038, Peoples R China.",wangwei_hydro@163.com; jia.liu@iwhr.com; lichuanzhe@iwhr.com; melodieyu@163.com; yufl@iwhr.com,,,National Natural Science Foundation of ChinaNational Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC) [51822906]; Major Science and Technology Program for Water Pollution Control and Treatment [2018ZX07110001]; National Key Research and Development Project [2017YFC1502405]; IWHR Research & Development Support Program [WR0145B732017],"This research was funded by the National Natural Science Foundation of China (51822906), the Major Science and Technology Program for Water Pollution Control and Treatment (2018ZX07110001), the National Key Research and Development Project (2017YFC1502405), and the IWHR Research & Development Support Program (WR0145B732017).",,60,1,1,6,13,MDPI,BASEL,"ST ALBAN-ANLAGE 66, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND",,2072-4292,,REMOTE SENS-BASEL,Remote Sens.,FEB,2021,13,4,,,,,,,595,10.3390/rs13040595,,,21,"Environmental Sciences; Geosciences, Multidisciplinary; Remote Sensing; Imaging Science & Photographic Technology",Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),Environmental Sciences & Ecology; Geology; Remote Sensing; Imaging Science & Photographic Technology,QQ3UF,WOS:000624448500001,,gold,,,2022-02-17

During the summer months the snow-melt-and glacier-melt-dominated river discharge originating in the mountains provides the main water resource available for agricultural production, but also for storage in reservoirs for energy generation during the winter months. Thus a reliable seasonal forecast of the water resources is crucial for sustainable management and planning of water resources. In fact, seasonal forecasts are mandatory tasks of all national hydro-meteorological services in the region. In order to support the operational seasonal forecast procedures of hydro-meteorological services, this study aims to develop a generic tool for deriving statistical forecast models of seasonal river discharge based solely on observational records. The generic model structure is kept as simple as possible in order to be driven by meteorological and hydrological data readily available at the hydro-meteorological services, and to be applicable for all catchments in the region. As snow melt dominates summer runoff, the main meteorological predictors for the forecast models are monthly values of winter precipitation and temperature, satellite-based snow cover data, and antecedent discharge. This basic predictor set was further extended by multi-monthly means of the individual predictors, as well as composites of the predictors. Forecast models are derived based on these predictors as linear combinations of up to four predictors. A user-selectable number of the best models is extracted automatically by the developed model fitting algorithm, which includes a test for robustness by a leave-one-out cross-validation. Based on the cross-validation the predictive uncertainty was quantified for every prediction model. Forecasts of the mean seasonal discharge of the period April to September are derived every month from January until June. The application of the model for several catchments in Central Asia - ranging from small to the largest rivers (240 to 290 000 km(2) catchment area) for the period 2000-2015 provided skilful forecasts for most catchments already in January, with adjusted R-2 values of the best model in the range of 0.6-0.8 for most of the catchments. The skill of the prediction increased every following month, i.e. with reduced lead time, with adjusted R-2 values usually in the range 0.8-0.9 for the best and 0.7-0.8 on average for the set of models in April just before the prediction period. The later forecasts in May and June improve further due to the high predictive power of the discharge in the first 2 months of the snow melt period. The improved skill of the set of forecast models with decreasing lead time resulted in narrow predictive uncertainty bands at the beginning of the snow melt period. In summary, the proposed generic automatic forecast model development tool provides robust predictions for seasonal water availability in Central Asia, which will be tested against the official forecasts in the upcoming years, with the vision of operational implementation.","[Apel, Heiko; Gerlitz, Lars; Unger-Shayesteh, Katy; Vorogushyn, Sergiy; Gafurov, Abror] GFZ German Res Ctr Geosci, Sect Hydrol 5 4, Potsdam, Germany; [Abdykerimova, Zharkinay] Hydrometeorol Serv Kyrgyzstan, Bishkek, Kyrgyzstan; [Agalhanova, Marina] Hydrometeorol Serv Turkmenistan, Ashkhabad, Turkmenistan; [Baimaganbetov, Azamat] Hydrometeorol Serv Kazakhstan, Alma Ata, Kazakhstan; [Gavrilenko, Nadejda] Hydrometeorol Serv Uzbekistan, Tashkent, Uzbekistan; [Kalashnikova, Olga] CAIAG, Bishkek, Kyrgyzstan",,"Apel, H (corresponding author), GFZ German Res Ctr Geosci, Sect Hydrol 5 4, Potsdam, Germany.",heiko.apel@gfz-potsdam.de,"Gafurov, Abror/AAQ-9362-2021; Apel, Heiko/AAY-9969-2020; Apel, Heiko/G-6280-2013; Vorogushyn, Sergiy/B-9743-2014","Apel, Heiko/0000-0002-8852-652X; Apel, Heiko/0000-0002-8852-652X; Baimaganbetov, Azamat/0000-0002-2773-2012; Vorogushyn, Sergiy/0000-0003-4639-7982","German Federal Foreign Office, German Water Initiative for Central Asia [AA7090002]","This work was undertaken within the framework of the CAWa project (http://www.cawa-project.net), funded by the German Federal Foreign Office as part of the German Water Initiative for Central Asia (grant number AA7090002).",,37,16,16,0,10,COPERNICUS GESELLSCHAFT MBH,GOTTINGEN,"BAHNHOFSALLEE 1E, GOTTINGEN, 37081, GERMANY",1027-5606,1607-7938,,HYDROL EARTH SYST SC,Hydrol.

The study is framed in the context of probabilistic Bayesian decision-making that is appropriate to take rational decisions on uncertain future outcomes. As opposed to the direct use of deterministic forecasts, the probabilistic forecast identifies a predictive probability density function that represents a fundamental knowledge on future occurrences. The added value of MCP-MT is the identification of the probability that a critical situation will happen within the forecast lead-time and when, more likely, it will occur. MCP-MT is thoroughly tested for both single-model and multi-model configurations at a gauged site on the Tiber River, central Italy. The stages forecasted by two operative deterministic models, STAFOM-RCM and MISDc, are considered for the study. The dataset used for the analysis consists of hourly data from 34 flood events selected on a time series of six years. MCP-MT improves over the original models' forecasts: the peak overestimation and the rising limb delayed forecast, characterizing MISDc and STAFOM-RCM respectively, are significantly mitigated, with a reduced mean error on peak stage from 45 to 5 cm and an increased coefficient of persistence from 0.53 up to 0.75. The results show that MCP-MT outperforms the single-temporal approach and is potentially useful for supporting decision-making because the exceedance probability of hydrometric thresholds within a forecast horizon and the most probable flooding time can be estimated.

Optimally managing these resources depends on predicting water availability. We built a probabilistic nonlinear regression water supply forecast (WSF) technique for the US Department of Agriculture, which runs the largest stand-alone WSF system in the US West. Design criteria included improved accuracy over the existing system; uncertainty estimates that seamlessly handle complex (heteroscedastic, non-Gaussian) prediction errors; integration of physical hydrometeorological process knowledge and domain-specific expert experience; ability to accommodate nonlinearity, model selection uncertainty and equifinality, and predictor multicollinearity and high dimensionality; and relatively easy, low-cost implementation. Some methods satisfied some of these requirements but none met all, leading us to develop a novel, interdisciplinary, and pragmatic prediction metasystem through a carefully considered synthesis of well-established, off-the-shelf components and approaches, spanning supervised and unsupervised machine learning, nonparametric statistical modeling, ensemble learning, and evolutionary optimization, focusing on maintaining but radically updating the principal components regression framework widely used for WSF. Testing this integrated multi-method prediction engine demonstrated its value for river forecasting; USDA adoption is a landmark for transitioning machine learning from research into practice in this field. Its ability to handle all the foregoing design criteria and requirements, which are not unique to WSF, suggests potential for extension to complex probabilistic prediction problems in other fields.","[Fleming, Sean W.] White Rabbit R&D LLC, Corvallis, OR 97333 USA; [Goodbody, Angus G.] Nat Resources Conservat Serv, USDA, Portland, OR 97232 USA",,"Fleming, SW (corresponding author), White Rabbit R&D LLC, Corvallis, OR 97333 USA.",whiterabbit.research.llc@gmail.com,,"Fleming, Sean William/0000-0002-0091-5302",US Department of Agriculture through Elyon International Inc.,This work was supported in part by funding to White Rabbit R&D LLC from the US Department of Agriculture through Elyon International Inc.,,55,12,12,3,4,IEEE-INST ELECTRICAL ELECTRONICS ENGINEERS INC,PISCATAWAY,"445 HOES LANE, PISCATAWAY, NJ 08855-4141 USA",2169-3536,,,IEEE ACCESS,IEEE Access,,2019,7,,,,,,119943,119964,,10.1109/ACCESS.2019.2936989,,,22,"Computer Science, Information Systems; Engineering, Electrical & Electronic; Telecommunications",Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),Computer Science; Engineering; Telecommunications,JP9EJ,WOS:000498559900008,,gold,,,2022-02-17

SnowCloudMetrics is a sub-component of SnowCloud that provides users with spatially and temporally composited snow cover information in an easy-to-use format. SnowCloudHydro is a simple spreadsheet-based model that uses Snow Cover Frequency (SCF) output from SnowCloudMetrics as a key model input. In this application, SnowCloudMetrics rapidly converts NASA's Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) daily snow cover product (MOD10A1) into a monthly snow cover frequency for a user-specified watershed area. SnowCloudHydro uses SCF and prior monthly streamflow to forecast streamflow for the subsequent month. We tested the skill of SnowCloudHydro in three snow-dominated headwaters that represent a range of precipitation/snowmelt runoff categories: the Rio Elqui in Northern Chile; the John Day River, in the Northwestern United States; and the Rio Aragon in Northern Spain. The skill of the SnowCloudHydro model directly corresponded to snowpack contributions to streamflow. Watersheds with proportionately more snowmelt than rain provided better results (R-2 values: 0.88, 0.52, and 0.22, respectively). To test the user experience of SnowCloud, we provided the tools and tutorials in English and Spanish to water resource managers in Chile, Spain, and the United States. Participants assessed their user experience, which was generally very positive. While these initial results focus on SnowCloud, they outline methods for developing cloud-based tools that can function effectively across cultures and languages. Our approach also addresses the primary challenges of science-based computing; human resource limitations, infrastructure costs, and expensive proprietary software. These challenges are particularly problematic in countries where scientific and computational resources are underdeveloped.","[Sproles, Eric A.; Nolin, Anne W.; Mar, Eugene] Oregon State Univ, Coll Earth Ocean & Atmospher Sci, Corvallis, OR 97331 USA; [Sproles, Eric A.] Montana State Univ, Dept Earth Sci, Bozeman, MT 59717 USA; [Crumley, Ryan L.] Oregon State Univ, Water Resources Sci, Corvallis, OR 77331 USA; [Nolin, Anne W.] Univ Nevada, Dept Geog, Corvallis, OR 97331 USA; [Lopez Moreno, Juan Ignacio] CSIC, Pyrenean Inst Ecol, Zaragoza 50059, Spain",,"Sproles, EA (corresponding author), Oregon State Univ, Coll Earth Ocean & Atmospher Sci, Corvallis, OR 97331 USA.; Sproles, EA (corresponding author), Montana State Univ, Dept Earth Sci, Bozeman, MT 59717 USA.",eric.sproles@montana.edu; ryanlcrumley@gmail.com; anne.nolin@gmail.com; gmar31@comcast.net; nlopez@ipe.csic.es,"López-Moreno, Juan Ignacio/K-2114-2014","López-Moreno, Juan Ignacio/0000-0002-7270-9313; Crumley, Ryan/0000-0001-7179-9321; Sproles, Eric/0000-0003-1245-1653",Earth Science Information Partners (ESIP); NASANational Aeronautics & Space Administration (NASA) [NNX16AG35G],This research was funded by an incubator grant from the Earth Science Information Partners (ESIP) and by NASA grant No. NNX16AG35G.,,40,10,10,1,6,MDPI,BASEL,"ST ALBAN-ANLAGE 66, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND",,2072-4292,,REMOTE SENS-BASEL,Remote Sens.,AUG,2018,10,8,,,,,,,1276,10.3390/rs10081276,,,15,"Environmental Sciences; Geosciences, Multidisciplinary; Remote Sensing; Imaging Science & Photographic Technology",Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),Environmental Sciences & Ecology; Geology; Remote Sensing; Imaging Science & Photographic Technology,GS4MF,WOS:000443618100112,,"Green Submitted, Green Published, gold",,,2022-02-17

The water flow of the Styr River is using for the needs of industry, agriculture and the population. Thus, forecasting the water flow of this river for the future is an important scientific and practical task. The hydrological forecasts that have a lead time of one year, two years, or a decade are not as reliable as they need to be. Now in the world this problem is not solved. Along with quantitative forecasting methods, the qualitative methods have also been developed. The method of commensurability refers to such methods. It was developed by Chinese geophysicist Weng Wen-Bo in 1984. The commensurability method supports prediction of various natural phenomena, including floods and other dangerous events. The objective of this paper is to use the Weng Wen-Bo method for long-term water flow forecasting of the Styr River at Lutsk city. Methods. The commensurability method uses the dates on which natural phenomena (earthquakes, floods, droughts, etc.) were observed. For this reason, it has been called the information method. It is characterized by simplicity of calculation, graphical visualization, the use of researcher intuition and minimum needs for input information. There are several ways of forecasting using the method of commensurability. This paper is used a method of forecasting by two-dimensional commensurability graphs. Such approach consists in the determining the commensurability values in the dates array of certain phenomena occurrence and creating a two-dimensional graph of commensurability, according to which forecasting occurs. The use of such a method allows determining the years that may be wet and dry in the near future. Results. The data of observations at the hydrological station of the Styr River - Lutsk city for the period 1923-2017 are used in the paper. The results of the study on the commensurability method show that the water flow of the river Styr in 2020-2021 should be more than the norm and in 2023-2024 - less than the norm. Scientific novelty and practical significance. In Ukraine the commensurability method was used for the first time for long-term forecasting of water flow for coming years. The estimating of the effectiveness of forecasting by the commensurability method requires an array of long-term forecasts. Therefore, the next step of the study should be to forecast of water flow on different rivers, but provided that they have the long series of observation. The results of the long-term forecasting will enable the relevant services the negative consequences of a hydrological phenomenon, such as low water flow or floods on rivers will prevent.","[Gorbachova, Liudmyla; Khrystiuk, Borys] Ukrainian Hydrometeorol Inst State Emergency Serv, Dept Hydrol Res, 37 Prospekt Nauky, UA-03028 Kiev, Ukraine; [Gorbachova, Liudmyla; Khrystiuk, Borys] Natl Acad Sci Ukraine, 37 Prospekt Nauky, UA-03028 Kiev, Ukraine",,"Gorbachova, L (corresponding author), Ukrainian Hydrometeorol Inst State Emergency Serv, Dept Hydrol Res, 37 Prospekt Nauky, UA-03028 Kiev, Ukraine.; Gorbachova, L (corresponding author), Natl Acad Sci Ukraine, 37 Prospekt Nauky, UA-03028 Kiev, Ukraine.",gorbachova@uhmi.org.ua; khryst@uhmi.org.ua,"Gorbachova, Liudmyla/AAB-9162-2020","Gorbachova, Liudmyla/0000-0003-1033-9385",,,,20,0,0,2,2,V N KARAZIN KHARKIV NATL UNIV,KHARKIV,"4, SVOBODY SQ, KHARKIV, 61022, UKRAINE",2410-7360,2411-3913,,VISN V N KKNU-GEOL G,Visn.

Recently, the data-driven models with a simpler model structure and lower data requirement attract much more attentions. An extreme learning machine (ELM) method, as a typical data-driven method, with the advantages of a faster learning process and stronger generalization ability, has been taken as an effective tool for flood forecasting. However, an ELM model may suffer from local minima in some cases because of its random generation of input weights and hidden layer biases, which results in uncertainties in the flood forecasting model. Therefore, we proposed an improved ELM model for short-term flood forecasting, in which an emerging dual population-based algorithm, named backtracking search algorithm (BSA), was applied to optimize the parameters of ELM. Thus, the proposed method is called ELM-BSA. The upper Yangtze River was selected as a case study. Several performance indexes were used to evaluate the efficiency of the proposed ELM-BSA model. Then the proposed model was compared with the currently used general regression neural network (GRNN) and ELM models. Results show that the ELM-BSA can always provide better results than the GRNN and ELM models in both the training and testing periods. All these results suggest that the proposed ELM-BSA model is a promising alternative technique for flood forecasting.","[Chen, Lu; Sun, Na; Zhou, Jianzhong; Zhou, Qing] Huazhong Univ Sci & Technol, Sch Hydropower & Informat Engn, Wuhan 430074, Hubei, Peoples R China; [Zhou, Chao] Changjiang Inst Survey Planning Design & Res, Wuhan 430010, Hubei, Peoples R China; [Zhou, Yanlai] Univ Oslo, Dept Geosci, N-1047 Oslo, Norway; [Zhang, Junhong] South Cent Univ Nationalities, Coll Resource & Environm, Wuhan 430074, Hubei, Peoples R China",,"Sun, N (corresponding author), Huazhong Univ Sci & Technol, Sch Hydropower & Informat Engn, Wuhan 430074, Hubei, Peoples R China.",chen_lu@hust.edu.cn; sunna@hust.edu.cn; zhouchao2@cjwsjy.com.cn; jz.zhou@hust.edu.cn; zyl23bulls@whu.edu.cn; zjh411891611@163.com; m201773780@hust.edu.cn,,"Zhou, Yanlai/0000-0002-5447-2420; CHEN, LU/0000-0002-5284-5393","National Key R & D Program of China [2017YFC0405900]; National Natural Science Foundation of ChinaNational Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC) [91547208, 51879109]",This research was funded by the National Key R & D Program of China (2017YFC0405900) and the National Natural Science Foundation of China (91547208; 51879109).,,37,6,7,4,16,MDPI,BASEL,"ST ALBAN-ANLAGE 66, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND",2073-4441,,,WATER-SUI,Water,OCT,2018,10,10,,,,,,,1362,10.3390/w10101362,,,17,Environmental Sciences; Water Resources,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),Environmental Sciences & Ecology; Water Resources,HB6UP,WOS:000451208400077,,"Green Submitted, Green Published, gold",,,2022-02-17

Of these variables, the influence of precipitation has been studied most widely, while temperature, radiative forcing and their derived product potential evapotranspiration (PET) have received little attention from the perspective of hydrological forecasting. This study aims to fill this gap by assessing the usability of potential evaporation forecasts for 10-day-ahead streamflow forecasting in the Rhine basin, Europe. In addition, the forecasts of the meteorological variables are compared with observations. Streamflow reforecasts were performed with the daily wflow_hbv model used in previous studies of the Rhine using the ECMWF 20-year meteorological reforecast dataset. Meteorological forecasts were compared with observed rainfall, temperature, global radiation and potential evaporation for 148 subbasins. Secondly, the effect of using PET climatology versus using observation-based estimates of PET was assessed for hydrological state and for streamflow forecast skill. We find that (1) there is considerable skill in the ECMWF reforecasts to predict PET for all seasons, and (2) using dynamical PET forcing based on observed temperature and satellite global radiation estimates results in lower evaporation and wetter initial states, but (3) the effect on forecasted 10-day streamflow is limited. Implications of this finding are that it is reasonable to use meteorological forecasts to forecast potential evaporation and use this is in mediumrange streamflow forecasts. However, it can be concluded that an approach using PET climatology is also sufficient, most probably not only for the application shown here, but also for most models similar to the HBV concept and for moderate climate zones. As a by-product, this research resulted in gridded datasets for temperature, radiation and potential evaporation based on the Makkink equation for the Rhine basin.

Machine learning methods recently have shown promising results in building accurate models for river flow prediction. This paper aims to identify models with higher accuracy, robustness, and generalization ability by inspecting the accuracy of a number of machine learning models. The proposed models for river flow include support vector regression (SVR), a hybrid of SVR with a fruit fly optimization algorithm (FOA) (so-called FOASVR), and an M5 model tree (M5). Additionally, the influence of periodicity (pi) on the forecasting enactment was examined. To assess the performance of the proposed models, different statistical meters were implemented, including root mean squared error (RMSE), mean absolute error (MAE), correlation coefficient (R), and Bayesian information criterion (BIC). Results showed that the FOASVR with RMSE (4.36 and 6.33 m(3)/s), MAE (2.40 and 3.71 m(3)/s) and R (0.82 and 0.81) values had the best performance in forecasting river flows at Babarud and Vaniar stations, respectively. Also, regarding BIC parameters, Q(t-1) and pi were selected as parsimonious inputs for predicting river flow one month ahead. Overall findings indicated that, although both the FOASVR and M5 predicted the river flows in suitable accordance with observed river flows, the performance of the FOASVR was moderately better than the M5 and periodicity noticeably increased the performance of the models; consequently, FOASVR can be suggested as the most accurate method for forecasting river flows.","[Samadianfard, Saeed] Univ Tabriz, Fac Agr, Dept Water Engn, Bahman Blvd 29, Tabriz, Iran; [Jarhan, Salar] Tech Univ Dresden, Dept Hydrosci, D-01069 Dresden, Germany; [Salwana, Ely] Univ Kebangsaan Malaysia, Inst Visual Informat, Bangi 43600, Selangor, Malaysia; [Mosavi, Amir] Oxford Brookes Univ, Sch Built Environm, Oxford OX3 0BP, England; [Mosavi, Amir] Obuda Univ, Kando Kalman Fac Elect Engn, Inst Automat, H-1034 Budapest, Hungary; [Mosavi, Amir] Queensland Univ Technol, Brisbane, Qld 4059, Australia; [Shamshirband, Shahaboddin] Ton Duc Thang Univ, Dept Management Sci & Technol Dev, Ho Chi Minh City, Vietnam; [Shamshirband, Shahaboddin] Ton Duc Thang Univ, Fac Informat Technol, Ho Chi Minh City, Vietnam; [Akib, Shatirah] Nottingham Trent Univ, Sch Architecture Design & Built Environm, 50 Shakespeare St, Nottingham NG1 4FQ, England",,"Shamshirband, S (corresponding author), Ton Duc Thang Univ, Dept Management Sci & Technol Dev, Ho Chi Minh City, Vietnam.; Shamshirband, S (corresponding author), Ton Duc Thang Univ, Fac Informat Technol, Ho Chi Minh City, Vietnam.",s.samadian@tabrizu.ac.ir; salar.jarhan@mailbox.tu-dresden.de; elysalwana@ukm.edu.my; amirhosein.mosavi@qut.edu.au; shahaboddin.shamshirband@tdtu.edu.vn; shatirah.akib@ntu.ac.uk,"Mosavi, Amir/I-7440-2018; S.Band, Shahab/AAD-3311-2021; S.Band, Shahab/ABI-7388-2020; Samadianfard, Saeed/ABF-1097-2021","Mosavi, Amir/0000-0003-4842-0613; S.Band, Shahab/0000-0001-6109-1311; S.Band, Shahab/0000-0002-8963-731X; Samadianfard, Saeed/0000-0002-6876-7182; , Ely Salwana/0000-0003-4311-3622; Shamshirband, Shahaboddin/0000-0002-6605-498X; Jarhan, Salar/0000-0002-3432-9985",,,,47,14,14,1,10,MDPI,BASEL,"ST ALBAN-ANLAGE 66, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND",,2073-4441,,WATER-SUI,Water,SEP,2019,11,9,,,,,,,1934,10.3390/w11091934,,,15,Environmental Sciences; Water Resources,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),Environmental Sciences & Ecology; Water Resources,JB8PJ,WOS:000488834400197,,"Green Submitted, gold",,,2022-02-17

The field pilots that have been run so far have shown varying results, inferred mainly from inter-well tracer studies and production data analysis. A research collaboration has been set up to advance the technology of using foam as a mobility control agent for CO2 EOR, with focus on integrated reservoir modelling to assist technology transfer to a high-cost environment. A heterogeneous carbonate reservoir onshore in west Texas, USA has been selected for the field trial. The reservoir has been waterflooded for more than 50 years, and a significant part of it has been on continuous CO2 injection for the last 5 years. An inverted five-spot pattern, which had rapid CO2 breakthrough in adjacent producers and is currently recycling significant amounts of CO2, has been selected for the study. The pilot is planned for 2 years with surfactant alternating gas (SAG) injection in the first year, followed by CO2 injection in the next year. A reservoir model was created by integrating available static and dynamic information. Since the measurement of static information and production performance is usually imprecise, even the most carefully constructed models do not exactly represent reality. In this paper, we present a workflow that was used to calibrate the reservoir model to historical data for practical forecasting, which takes into account a wide range of uncertainties caused by the inaccessibility of information. Laboratory studies were performed with reservoir cores, fluids and selected surfactant to obtain the base values of foam model parameters. As an output, distributions for key performance indicators such as cumulative oil production and CO2 retention were generated for the proposed pilot to guide further decision-making.","[Sharma, M.; Skjaeveland, S.

It has caused many casualties and massive destruction of property. Estimating the chance of a flood occurring depends on several factors, such as rainfall, the structure and the flow rate of the river. This research used the neural network autoregressive exogenous input (NNARX) model to predict floods. One of the research challenges was to develop accurate models and improve the forecasting model. This research aimed to improve the performance of the neural network model for flood prediction. A new technique was proposed for modelling nonlinear data of flood forecasting using the wavelet decomposition-NNARX approach. This paper discusses the process of identifying the parameters involved to make a forecast as the rainfall value requires the flow rate of the river and its water level. The original data were processed by wavelet decomposition and filtered to generate a new set of data for the NNARX prediction model where the process can be compared. This research compared the performance of the wavelet and the non-wavelet NNARX model. Experimental results showed that the proposed approach had better performance testing results in relation to its counterpart in terms of hourly forecast, with the mean square error (MSE) of 2.0491e-4 m2 compared to 6.16420 e(-4) m(2), respectively. The proposed approach was also studied for long-term forecast up to 5 years, where the obtained MSE was higher, i.e., 0.0016 m(2).","[Anuar, Mohd Azrol Syafiee; Rahman, Ribhan Zafira Abdul; Soh, Azura Che; Noor, Samsul Bahari Mohd] Univ Putra Malaysia, Fac Engn, Dept Elect & Elect Engn, Seri Kembangan 43400, Selangor, Malaysia; [Zulkafli, Zed Diyana] Univ Putra Malaysia, Fac Engn, Dept Civil Engn, Seri Kembangan 43400, Selangor, Malaysia",,"Anuar, MAS (corresponding author), Univ Putra Malaysia, Fac Engn, Dept Elect & Elect Engn, Seri Kembangan 43400, Selangor, Malaysia.",azrolsyafiee93@gmail.com; ribhan@upm.edu.my; azuracs@upm.edu.my; samsul@upm.edu.my; zeddiyana@upm.edu.my,,,,,,31,0,0,2,2,"J J STROSSMAYER UNIV OSIJEK, FAC ELECTRICAL ENGINEERING",OSIJEK,"KNEZA TRPIMIRA 2B, OSIJEK, 31000, CROATIA",1847-6996,1847-7003,,INT J ELECTR COMPUT,Int.

A trial climate service was developed in 2016, producing a prototype seasonal forecast product for use by stakeholders in the region, based on rainfall forecasts directly from a dynamical model. Here, we describe an improved service based on a simple statistical downscaling approach. Through using dynamical forecast of an East Asian summer monsoon (EASM) index, seasonal mean rainfall for the upper and middle/lower reaches of YRB can be forecast separately by use of the statistical downscaling, with significant skills for lead times of up to at least three months. The skill in different sub-basin regions of YRB varies with the target season. The rainfall forecast skill in the middle/lower reaches of YRB is significant in May-June-July (MJJ), and the forecast skill for rainfall in the upper reaches of YRB is significant in June-July-August (JJA). The mean rainfall for the basin as a whole can be skillfully forecast in both MJJ and JJA. The forecasts issued in 2019 gave good guidance for the enhanced rainfall in the MJJ period and the near-average conditions in JJA. Initial feedback from users in the basin suggests that the improved forecasts better meet their needs and will enable more robust decision-making.","[Bett, Philip E.; Martin, Nicola; Scaife, Adam A.; Dunstone, Nick; Martin, Gill M.; Golding, Nicola; Camp, Joanne; Hewitt, Chris D.; Hermanson, Leon] Met Off Hadley Ctr, Exeter EX1 3PB, Devon, England; [Martin, Nicola] Plymouth Marine Lab, Plymouth PL1 3DH, Devon, England; [Scaife, Adam A.] Univ Exeter, Coll Engn Math & Phys Sci, Exeter EX4 4QF, Devon, England; [Zhang, Peiqun; Ren, Hong-Li; Liu, Ying] China Meteorol Adm, Lab Climate Studies, Natl Climate Ctr, Beijing 100081, Peoples R China; [Hewitt, Chris D.] Univ Southern Queensland, Toowoomba, Qld 4350, Australia; [Li, Chaofan] Chinese Acad Sci, Inst Atmospher Phys, Ctr Monsoon Syst Res, Beijing 100029, Peoples R China; [Liu, Ying] Nanjing Univ Informat Sci & Technol, Collaborat Innovat Ctr Forecast & Evaluat Meteoro, Nanjing 210044, Peoples R China; [Liu, Min] Wuhan Reg Climate Ctr, Wuhan 430074, Peoples R China",,"Bett, PE (corresponding author), Met Off Hadley Ctr, Exeter EX1 3PB, Devon, England.",philip.bett@metoffice.gov.uk,"Bett, Philip E/I-2682-2012","Bett, Philip E/0000-0002-4508-7192; Hewitt, Chris/0000-0002-4718-4009",UK-China Research and Innovation Partnership Fund through the Met Office Climate Science for Service Partnership (CSSP) China as part of the Newton Fund,Supported by the UK-China Research and Innovation Partnership Fund through the Met Office Climate Science for Service Partnership (CSSP) China as part of the Newton Fund.,,53,5,5,1,9,SPRINGER HEIDELBERG,HEIDELBERG,"TIERGARTENSTRASSE 17, D-69121 HEIDELBERG, GERMANY",2095-6037,2198-0934,,J METEOROL RES-PRC,J.

While most of the past studies were concentrated on revealing the relationship between streamflow and single concurrent or lagged climate indices, this study intends to explore the combined impact of large-scale climate drivers. Considering their influences on the streamflow of NSW, several major climate drivers - IPO (Inter Decadal Pacific Oscillation)/PDO (Pacific Decadal Oscillation), IOD (Indian Ocean Dipole) and ENSO (El Nino-Southern Oscillation) are selected. Single correlation analysis is exploited as the basis for selecting different combinations of input variables for developing MLR models to examine the extent of the combined impacts of the selected climate drivers on forecasting spring streamflow several months ahead. The developed models with all the possible combinations show significantly good results for all selected 12 stations in terms of Pearson correlation (r), root mean square error (RMSE), mean absolute error (MAE) and Willmott index of agreement (d). For each region, the best model with lower errors provides statistically significant maximum correlation which ranges from 0.51 to 0.65.","[Esha, Rijwana, I; Imteaz, Monzur A.] Swinburne Univ Technol, Dept Civil & Construct Engn, Melbourne, Vic 3122, Australia",,"Imteaz, MA (corresponding author), Swinburne Univ Technol, Dept Civil & Construct Engn, Melbourne, Vic 3122, Australia.",mimteaz@swin.edu.au,"Imteaz, Monzur Alam/AAX-6892-2020","Imteaz, Monzur Alam/0000-0003-1800-3157; Esha, Rijwana/0000-0002-3048-1728",,,,72,6,6,4,10,IWA PUBLISHING,LONDON,"ALLIANCE HOUSE, 12 CAXTON ST, LONDON SW1H0QS, ENGLAND",0029-1277,2224-7955,,HYDROL RES,Hydrol.

However, raw EWFs are usually biased and under-dispersive and so cannot be directly used in ESP, leading to the development of several post-processing methods. The performance of these methods needs to be evaluated/compared in building ESP based on deterministic and probabilistic criteria. In addition, likely influencing factors also need to be identified. This study evaluated the performance of four state-of-the-art methods: the Generator-based Post-Processing (GPP) method, Extended Logistic Regression (ExLR), Bayesian Model Averaging (BMA) and Affine Kernel Dressing (AKD), using a simple bias correction (BC) method as a benchmark. The evaluation was carried out over four watersheds with different basin areas in the humid region of central-south China based on the weather reforecasts from the Global Ensemble Forecasting System (GEFS). The results show that the performance of the post-processing methods varies with the forecast variable (precipitation, or air temperature or streamflow), but all of them outperform the BC and GEFS. For the four post-processing methods, the advantage of the generator-based methods (GPP and ExLR) lies in their probabilistic performance, which outperforms the distribution-based methods (BMA and AKD) by about 10% in precipitation forecasts and about 20% in streamflow forecasts, while the distribution-based methods (BMA and AKD) are better at their deterministic performance for precipitation forecasts, with a benefit of about 15%. Meanwhile, the post-processing methods generally perform better for precipitation and streamflow forecasts, but worse for air temperature forecasts for a bigger basin compared to the distribution-based methods. The results of this study emphasize the importance of considering the uncertainty of post-processing methods in ESP.","[Li, Xiang-Quan; Chen, Jie; Xu, Chong-Yu; Chen, Hua] Wuhan Univ, State Key Lab Water Resources & Hydropower Engn S, Wuhan 430072, Hubei, Peoples R China; [Xu, Chong-Yu] Univ Oslo, Dept Geosci, N-0316 Oslo, Norway; [Li, Lu] Bjerknes Ctr Climate Res, Uni Res Climate, Bergen, Norway",,"Chen, J (corresponding author), Wuhan Univ, State Key Lab Water Resources & Hydropower Engn S, Wuhan 430072, Hubei, Peoples R China.",jiechen@whu.edu.cn,"Chen, hua/AAN-1532-2020; Xu, Chong-Yu/B-2941-2012; Li, Lu/AAZ-8193-2020","Xu, Chong-Yu/0000-0003-4826-5350; Li, Lu/0000-0003-3638-618X","National Natural Science Foundation of ChinaNational Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC) [51779176, 51539009]; Overseas Expertise Introduction Project for Discipline Innovation (111 Project) - Ministry of Education; State Administration of Foreign Experts Affairs P.

Climate change may disrupt populations of marine animals that are linked to such temperature-dependent events. We analysed the relationship of the abundance of giant Pacific octopuses (Enteroctopus dofleini) to Gulf of Alaska and Washington State water temperatures. Abundance was measured in targeted visual surveys in Prince William Sound, Alaska, over the period 1995-2016 and from REEF.org diver surveys in Washington State from 2003 to 2019. Octopus counts from both survey programs had significant negative correlations with water temperatures over the previous 2.5-4 years. Water temperature accounted for from 0.41 to 0.71 of the variance (R-2) in octopus abundance in eastern Gulf of Alaska waters located in ocean currents up-stream of the survey areas, and up to 0.81 of the variance in Washington State waters. These negative correlations provide a possible predictive index for octopus abundance as measured by targeted visual surveys. These methods may be useful tools in management of octopuses and indicate impacts of climate change on North Pacific coastal marine ecosystems.","[Scheel, D.] Alaska Pacific Univ, 4101 Univ Dr, Anchorage, AK 99508 USA",,"Scheel, D (corresponding author), Alaska Pacific Univ, 4101 Univ Dr, Anchorage, AK 99508 USA.",dscheel@alaskapacific.edu; curtis@curtismasonjohnson.com,,"Johnson, Curtis/0000-0003-2855-4606; Scheel, David/0000-0001-6223-7124","Exxon Valdez Oil Spill Trustee CouncilExxon Mobil Corporation; West Coast and Polar Regions Underseas Research Center (University of Alaska Fairbanks National Undersea Research Program, NOAA 1998, 2010); National Science FoundationNational Science Foundation (NSF) [0115882]; Alaska Space Grant Program NASA (2008-2010); Alaska Fisheries Development Foundation","Long-term financial support for this study was provided through APU from donations by the Pollock Conservation Consortium (2001-2016); with additional support from the Exxon Valdez Oil Spill Trustee Council (1995-1997), West Coast and Polar Regions Underseas Research Center (University of Alaska Fairbanks National Undersea Research Program, NOAA 1998, 2010), National Science Foundation (Grant number 0115882 2001-2003), Alaska Space Grant Program NASA (2008-2010), and Alaska Fisheries Development Foundation (2006) to D.

Numerical simulation with the modified model gave results which were in good agreement with the real seasonal variations of thermal regime in lake part of Gorky water reservoir. The best quantitative and qualitative agreement was obtained for the thermal regimes with strong mixing: the results of the forecasting reproduced the forms of distribution and the values of temperature extremely accurately.

In this study, a drought forecasting system based on eight state-of-the-art climate models from the North American Multi-Model Ensemble (NMME) and a Distributed Time-Variant Gain Hydrological Model (DTVGM) was established and assessed over the upstream and midstream of Heihe River basin (UHRB and MHRB), a typical arid endorheic basin. The 3-month Standardized Precipitation Index (SPI3) and 1-month Standardized Streamflow Index (SSI1) were used to capture meteorological and hydrological drought, and values below - 1 indicate drought events. The skill of the forecasting systems was evaluated in terms of anomaly correlation (AC) and Brier score (BS) or Brier skill score (BSS). The predictability for meteorological drought was quantified using AC and BS with a perfect model assumption, referring to the upper limit of forecast skill. The hydrological predictability was to distinguish the role of initial hydrological conditions (ICs) and meteorological forcings, which was quantified by root-mean-square error (RMSE) within the ESP (Ensemble Streamflow Prediction) and reverse ESP framework. The UHRB and MHRB showed season-dependent meteorological drought predictability and forecast skill, with higher values during winter and autumn than that during spring. For hydrological forecasts, the forecast skill in the UHRB was higher than that in MHRB. Predicting meteorological droughts more than 2 months in advance became difficult because of complex climate mechanisms. However, the hydrological drought forecasts could show some skills up to 3-6 lead months due to memory of ICs during cold and dry sea-sons. During wet seasons, there are no skillful hydrological predictions from lead month 2 onwards because of the dominant role of meteorological forcings. During spring, the improvement of hydrological drought predictions was the most significant as more streamflow was generated by seasonal snowmelt. Besides meteorological forcings and ICs, human activities have reduced the hydrological variability and increased hydrological drought predictability during the wet seasons in the MHRB.","[Ma, Feng; Ye, Aizhong; Duan, Qingyun] Beijing Normal Univ, Fac Geog Sci, State Key Lab Earth Surface & Ecol Resources, Beijing 100875, Peoples R China; [Ma, Feng; Luo, Lifeng] Michigan State Univ, Dept Geog Environm & Spatial Sci, E Lansing, MI 48824 USA",,"Ye, AZ (corresponding author), Beijing Normal Univ, Fac Geog Sci, State Key Lab Earth Surface & Ecol Resources, Beijing 100875, Peoples R China.",azye@bnu.edu.cn,"Duan, Qingyun/C-7652-2011","Duan, Qingyun/0000-0001-9955-1512; Luo, Lifeng/0000-0002-2829-7104; ye, aizhong/0000-0002-5272-134X","Strategic Priority Research Program of the Chinese Academy of SciencesChinese Academy of Sciences [XDA19070104, XDA20060401]; Natural Science Foundation of ChinaNational Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC) [51879009, 41475093]; State Key Laboratory of Earth Surface Processes and Resource Ecology Open Research Program [2017-KF-17]; Water Science Network WaterCube Program at Michigan State University","This work was supported by the Strategic Priority Research Program of the Chinese Academy of Sciences (no.

Therefore, they suggested frameworks to include measurement uncertainty in the rating curve to make it robust. Despite their efforts, a robust rating curve is often ignored in traditional practices, considering the investment of time and money as well as the resulting benefit from it. In the current research, we are interested in understanding the role of the measurement error variance in real-time streamflow forecasting. Our objectives are (i) to employ a state-of-the-art statistical forecasting model that can handle measurement uncertainty in daily streamflow and (ii) to understand the trade-off in forecasting performance when substantial knowledge regarding the measurement uncertainty is provided to the modeler. We apply the Bayesian dynamic hierarchical model (BDHM) on four gauging sites in the United States. Results show that the BDHM performs better than the daily climatology and local linear regression model. Also, the forecast variance changes proportionally with the change in the error variance as an input in the observation equation. Following this, we design a simulation-based study, which assigns the measurement error in the reported streamflow to obtain multiple realizations of the true streamflow. The inclusion of substantial knowledge about the true error improves the BDHM's performance by lowering the CRPS (continuous rank probability score) values. However, the inclusion increases the forecast variance to bring the true streamflow within the sampling variability of the forecasted streamflow. Overall, an improved trade-off between the success rate of forecasts and the forecast variance can be achieved by including the measurement error in the BDHM for rivers that witness less dispersed streamflow data. Plain Language Summary Rating curve uncertainty is one of the major sources of measurement uncertainty in reported streamflow. It occurs when a precalibrated stage-discharge relationship curve is used to indirectly measure the streamflow volume based on river stage measurement. Considering the cost and time involved to include the uncertainty in reported streamflow, rating curve uncertainty is often ignored in traditional streamflow modeling practices. The current study adopts a state-of-the-art statistical model that can include rating curve uncertainty while issuing daily streamflow forecasts 1 to 3 days in advance. The study found that a proper knowledge of rating curve uncertainty at a gauge site significantly improves the forecasting of true streamflow. Key Points Bayesian dynamic hierarchical model (BDHM) can include the measurement uncertainty that has a substantial impact on real-time forecasting BDHM efficiently predicts the reported streamflow 1 to 3 days in advance while compared with the daily climatology and a semiparametric forecasting model Knowledge of the measurement uncertainty improves the overall performance of BDHM in predicting the true streamflows","[Das Bhowmik, Rajarshi] Indian Inst Sci, Dept Civil Engn, Bangalore, Karnataka, India; [Ng, Tze Ling] Hong Kong Univ Sci & Technol, Dept Civil & Environm Engn, Clear Water Bay, Hong Kong, Peoples R China; [Ng, Tze Ling] CSIRO Land & Water, Clayton, Vic, Australia; [Wang, Jui-Pin] Natl Cent Univ, Dept Civil Engn, Taoyuan, Taiwan",,"Das Bhowmik, R (corresponding author), Indian Inst Sci, Dept Civil Engn, Bangalore, Karnataka, India.",rajarshidb@iisc.ac.in,,"Das Bhowmik, Rajarshi/0000-0002-2849-3180; Ng, Tze Ling/0000-0002-3993-1625","Department of Civil and Environmental Engineering, The Hong Kong University of Science & Technology (Hong Kong SAR)","The authors would like to thank the Department of Civil and Environmental Engineering, The Hong Kong University of Science & Technology (Hong Kong SAR), for providing internal funding to carry out the current study.

Accordingly, mutual information function, correlation dimension, averaged false nearest neighbor with E1 and E2 quantities, and complexity analysis that uses sample entropy coupled with iterative amplitude adjusted Fourier transform were employed as nonlinear deterministic identification tools. We investigated forecasting of daily streamflow for three climatologically different Swedish rivers, Helge, Ljusnan, and Kalix Rivers using self-exciting threshold autoregressive (SETAR), k-nearest neighbor (k-nn), and artificial neural networks (ANN). The results suggest that the streamflow in these rivers during the 1957-2012 period exhibited dynamics from low to high complexity. Specifically, (1) lower complexity lead to higher predictability at all leadtimes and the models' worst performances were obtained for the most complex streamflow (Ljusnan River), (2) ANN was the best model for 1-day ahead forecasting independent of complexity, (3) SETAR was the best model for 7-day ahead forecasting by means of performance indices, especially for less complexity, (4) the largest error propagation was obtained with the k-nn and ANN and thus these models should be carefully used beyond 2-day forecasting, and (5) higher number input variables except for the dominant variables made insignificant impact on forecasting performances for ANN and k-nn models.","[Tongal, Hakan] Suleyman Demirel Univ, Fac Engn, Dept Civil Engn, TR-32260 Isparta, Turkey; [Berndtsson, Ronny] Lund Univ, Ctr Middle Eastern Studies, S-22100 Lund, Sweden; [Berndtsson, Ronny] Lund Univ, Dept Water Resources Engn, S-22100 Lund, Sweden",,"Tongal, H (corresponding author), Suleyman Demirel Univ, Fac Engn, Dept Civil Engn, TR-32260 Isparta, Turkey.",hakantongal@sdu.edu.tr; ronny.berndtsson@tvrl.lth.se,"Tongal, Hakan/A-4923-2018; Berndtsson, Ronny/C-7449-2015","Tongal, Hakan/0000-0002-0501-7894; Berndtsson, Ronny/0000-0003-1473-0138",,,,106,22,22,0,18,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"233 SPRING ST, NEW YORK, NY 10013 USA",1436-3240,1436-3259,,STOCH ENV RES RISK A,Stoch.

The aim of this research was to obtain a more reliable ANN model that uses fewer monitoring records, by simultaneous optimization of the following model parameters: number of monitoring sites, number of historical monitoring data (expressed in years), and number of input water quality parameters used. Box-Behnken three-factor at three levels experimental design was applied for simultaneous spatial, temporal, and input variables optimization of the ANN model. The prediction of DO was performed using a feed-forward back-propagation neural network (BPNN), while the selection of most important inputs was done off-model using multi-filter approach that combines a chi-square ranking in the first step with a correlation-based elimination in the second step. The contour plots of absolute and relative error response surfaces were utilized to determine the optimal values of design factors. From the contour plots, two BPNN models that cover entire Danube flow through Serbia are proposed: an upstream model (BPNN-UP) that covers 8 monitoring sites prior to Belgrade and uses 12 inputs measured in the 7-year period and a downstream model (BPNN-DOWN) which covers 9 monitoring sites and uses 11 input parameters measured in the 6-year period. The main difference between the two models is that BPNN-UP utilizes inputs such as BOD, P, and PO43-, which is in accordance with the fact that this model covers northern part of Serbia (Vojvodina Autonomous Province) which is well-known for agricultural production and extensive use of fertilizers. Both models have shown very good agreement between measured and predicted DO (with R-2 >= 0.86) and demonstrated that they can effectively forecast DO content in the Danube River.","[Tomic, Aleksandra Siljic; Ristic, Mirjana; Peric-Grujic, Aleksandra; Pocajt, Viktor] Univ Belgrade, Fac Technol & Met, Karnegijeva 4, Belgrade 11120, Serbia; [Antanasijevic, Davor] Univ Belgrade, Fac Technol & Met, Innovat Ctr, Karnegijeva 4, Belgrade 11120, Serbia",,"Antanasijevic, D (corresponding author), Univ Belgrade, Fac Technol & Met, Innovat Ctr, Karnegijeva 4, Belgrade 11120, Serbia.",dantanasijevic@tmf.bg.ac.rs,"Antanasijevic, Davor/D-4242-2014","Antanasijevic, Davor/0000-0002-0915-1281","Ministry of Education, Science and Technological Development of the Republic of SerbiaMinistry of Education, Science & Technological Development, Serbia [172007]","This work was supported by the Ministry of Education, Science and Technological Development of the Republic of Serbia [Project No. 172007].",,54,15,15,1,25,SPRINGER HEIDELBERG,HEIDELBERG,"TIERGARTENSTRASSE 17, D-69121 HEIDELBERG, GERMANY",0944-1344,1614-7499,,ENVIRON SCI POLLUT R,Environ.

This study aims to predict and evaluate hydrological drought in the southwestern margin of the Caspian Sea. For this, Streamflow Drought Index (SDI) is used as a multi-scalar hydrological drought indicator and calculated in time windows of 1, 3, 6, 9 and 12-month. In this study, time series stochastic models were used for the first time to predict SDI and compared with two black-box machine learning (ML) methods including Adaptive Neuro-Fuzzy Inference System (ANFIS) and Group Method of Data Handling (GMDH). The used data belongs to two rivers named Khalkaei and Pasikhan in Guilan province, and the period of 1986-2015 on a monthly scale. Autocorrelation and Partial Autocorrelation Functions (ACF and PACF) was used for selecting inputs among the series' monthly time lags. The results showed that there are seasonal trends in SDI's 1, 3, 6 and 9-month time windows; therefore, these time windows have better adaptability with the Seasonal Autoregressive Integrated Moving Average (SARIMA) model. But there is no seasonal trend in the 12-month time window (SDI12) series and the non-seasonal Autoregressive Moving Average (ARMA) model was found as the best choice for this time window. Among the models, the MLs (GMDH and ANFIS) had approximately similar prediction accuracies. Comparing the models indicate that the linear stochastic models in addition to the simplicity of use were significantly more accurate than the complex non-linear ML models. The current results suggest using the stochastic models for hydrological drought forecasting, in catchment areas.","[Aghelpour, Pouya; Varshavian, Vahid] Bu Ali Sina Univ, Fac Agr, Dept Water Engn, Hamadan, Hamadan, Iran; [Bahrami-Pichaghchi, Hadigheh] Sari Agr Sci & Nat Resources Univ, Fac Agr Engn, Dept Water Engn, Sari, Iran",,"Varshavian, V (corresponding author), Bu Ali Sina Univ, Fac Agr, Dept Water Engn, Hamadan, Hamadan, Iran.",aghelpoor_p68@yahoo.com; hadigheh.bahrami70@gmail.com; v.varshavian@basu.ac.ir,"Varshavian, Vahid/AAX-3323-2020; Aghelpour, Pouya/AAQ-3174-2020","Varshavian, Vahid/0000-0002-9705-3066; Aghelpour, Pouya/0000-0002-5640-865X; Bahrami-Pichaghchi, Hadigheh/0000-0002-7621-8888",,,,40,8,9,2,9,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"ONE NEW YORK PLAZA, SUITE 4600, NEW YORK, NY, UNITED STATES",1436-3240,1436-3259,,STOCH ENV RES RISK A,Stoch.

Deciding when to release water depends partly on forecasts of how much more rain and snowmelt will flow into the reservoirs. Often these forecasts express uncertainty, reporting a range of possible flows. We examined how those responsible for releasing water from reservoirs respond to forecasts using a case study of the historical record of past forecasts and water releases in California's Sierra Nevada. Results from a panel data model with fixed effects showed that these water managers hedge their bets against the possibility of less water than forecasted. Greater uncertainty in a forecast was associated significantly with a reduced amount of released water, and the effect of uncertainty on releases declined as the forecast volume increased (adjusted R-2=0.70, F-test pMUCH LESS-THAN0.001). Our results suggest that increasing water managers' confidence in upcoming flows by reducing forecast uncertainty would allow more water to be released from reservoirs earlier in the year, without the need for direct coordination with these managers.","[Stillinger, Timbo] Univ Calif Santa Barbara, Earth Res Inst, Santa Barbara, CA 93106 USA; [Costello, Christopher; Dozier, Jeff] Univ Calif Santa Barbara, Bren Sch Environm Sci & Management, Santa Barbara, CA 93106 USA; [Bales, Roger C.] Univ Calif Merced, Sierra Nevada Res Inst, Engn, Merced, CA 95343 USA",,"Stillinger, T (corresponding author), Univ Calif Santa Barbara, Earth Res Inst, Santa Barbara, CA 93106 USA.",tcs@ucsb.edu,"Dozier, Jeff/B-7364-2009","Dozier, Jeff/0000-0001-8542-431X; Stillinger, Timbo/0000-0001-5250-4495",University of CaliforniaUniversity of California System [LFR-18-548316],This work was supported by the University of California award LFR-18-548316.,,28,1,1,3,3,ASCE-AMER SOC CIVIL ENGINEERS,RESTON,"1801 ALEXANDER BELL DR, RESTON, VA 20191-4400 USA",0733-9496,1943-5452,,J WATER RES PLAN MAN,J.

A post-processor like the Ensemble Pre-Processor (EPP) developed by U.S. National Weather Service must be used to remove various biases and to extract useful predictive information from those forecasts, In this paper, we investigate how different designs of canonical events in the EPP can help post-process precipitation forecasts from the Global Ensemble Forecast System (GEFS) and Climate Forecast System Version 2 (CFSv2). The use of canonical events allow those products to be linked seamlessly and then the post-processed ensemble precipitation forecasts can be generated using the Schaake Shuffle procedure. We used the post-processed ensemble precipitation forecasts to drive a distributed hydrological model to obtain ensemble streamflow forecasts and evaluated those forecasts against the observed streamflow. We found that the careful design of canonical events can help extract more useful information, especially when up-to-date observed precipitation is used to setup the canonical events. We also found that streamflow forecasts using post-processed precipitation forecasts have longer lead times and higher accuracy than streamflow forecasts made by traditional Extend Streamflow Prediction (ESP) and the forecasts based on original GEFS and CFSv2 precipitation forecasts.

Thus, many hydrological models are propose and developed by researchers around the world to forecast flood disaster ahead of time for evacuation purposes. However, it is very difficult to develop flood model because all physical parameters that represent the flood behaviour must be included in the modelling. Parameters such as the depth of river basin, river flow rate and sediment factors data are very difficult to get. Hence, this paper proposes flood prediction model using black-box model. It is call black-box model because the model is develop using only input and output data without the needs to know the physical parameters that contribute to flood disaster. Neural Network Autoregressive with Exogenous Inputs (NNARX) is one type of black-box model that is widely applied to solve the nonlinear problems. In order to develop the model, flood data were divide into 3 samples that are modelling sample, validation sample and testing sample. All samples were provide from related government agency and it is real-time data. The model were develop using two different training functions in order to obtain the optimal ones.

We assess a recently developed forecasting system called forecast guided stochastic scenarios (FoGSS) as a skilful alternative to standard stochastic scenarios for the Australian continent. FoGSS uses climate forecasts from a coupled oceanland-atmosphere prediction system, post-processed with the method of calibration, bridging and merging. Ensemble rainfall forecasts force a monthly rainfall-runoff model, while a staged hydrological error model quantifies and propagates hydrological forecast uncertainty through forecast lead times. FoGSS is able to generate ensemble streamflow forecasts in the form of monthly time series to a 12-month forecast horizon. FoGSS is tested on 63 Australian catchments that cover a wide range of climates, including 21 ephemeral rivers. In all perennial and many ephemeral catchments, FoGSS provides an effective alternative to resampled historical inflow sequences. FoGSS generally produces skilful forecasts at shorter lead times (< 4 months), and transits to climatologylike forecasts at longer lead times. Forecasts are generally reliable and unbiased. However, FoGSS does not perform well in very dry catchments (catchments that experience zero flows more than half the time in some months), sometimes producing strongly negative forecast skill and poor reliability. We attempt to improve forecasts through the use of (i) ESP rainfall forcings, (ii) different rainfall-runoff mod-els, and (iii) a Bayesian prior to encourage the error model to return climatology forecasts in months when the rainfallrunoff model performs poorly. Of these, the use of the prior offers the clearest benefit in very dry catchments, where it moderates strongly negative forecast skill and reduces bias in some instances. However, the prior does not remedy poor reliability in very dry catchments. Overall, FoGSS is an attractive alternative to historical inflow sequences in all but the driest catchments. We discuss ways in which forecast reliability in very dry catchments could be improved in future work.","[Bennett, James C.; Robertson, David E.] CSIRO Land & Water, Clayton, Vic, Australia; [Bennett, James C.; Michael, Kelvin] Univ Tasmania, Inst Marine & Antarctic Studies, Hobart, Tas, Australia; [Wang, Quan J.] Univ Melbourne, Dept Infrastruct Engn, Parkville, Vic, Australia; [Schepen, Andrew] CSIRO Land & Water, Dutton Pk, Qld, Australia; [Li, Ming] CSIRO Data61, Floreat, WA, Australia",,"Bennett, JC (corresponding author), CSIRO Land & Water, Clayton, Vic, Australia.; Bennett, JC (corresponding author), Univ Tasmania, Inst Marine & Antarctic Studies, Hobart, Tas, Australia.",james.bennett@csiro.au,"Robertson, David/C-3643-2011; Schepen, Andrew/AAG-8880-2020; Wang, Quan J/D-2674-2012; Li, Ming/A-7655-2010; Bennett, James C/C-8456-2013","Robertson, David/0000-0003-4230-8006; Schepen, Andrew/0000-0002-6372-735X; Wang, Quan J/0000-0002-8787-2738; Bennett, James C/0000-0002-4930-2638",Water Information Research and Development Alliance (WIRADA); Bureau of MeteorologyBureau of Meteorology - Australia; CSIRO Land Water,"This research has been supported by the Water Information Research and Development Alliance (WIRADA) between the Bureau of Meteorology and CSIRO Land & Water.

However, ensembles that only account for meteorological forecast uncertainty are typically biased and subject to dispersion errors, thus limiting their use for rational decision-making and optimization systems. Statistical postprocessing is therefore necessary to convert ensemble forecasts into calibrated and sharp predictive distributions, and it should also account for dependencies between lead times to enable realistic forecast trajectories. This work provides a continental-scale assessment of the use of statistical postprocessing on medium-range, ensemble streamflow forecasts over South America (SA). These forecasts were produced through a large-scale hydrologic-hydrodynamic model forced with a global precipitation dataset and ECMWF reforecast data. The Ensemble Model Output Statistics (EMOS) technique was used to generate conditional predictive distributions in 488 locations at each forecast lead time, while the Ensemble Copula Coupling method with the transformation scheme (ECC-T) was applied to derive ensemble traces from EMOS distributions. Postprocessed streamflow forecasts were cross-validated for the period from 1996 to 2014 using a range of verification metrics. Results showed that the skill and reliability of EMOS forecasts substantially improve over the raw ensembles, and that EMOS leads to skillful predictions relative to discharge climatology and persistence forecasts up to 15 days in advance in most locations. Furthermore, EMOS results in predictive distributions that are generally sharper than the climatology. Limitations in depicting autocorrelations of forecast trajectories were observed in rivers for which the raw ensemble spread is very low and EMOS has to largely increase dispersion, especially at short lead times. The study's findings suggest that combining a continental-scale hydrological model with EMOS and ECC-T methods can lead to skillful predictions and realistic ensemble traces in several locations in SA, even if in situ hydrometeorological observations are not available in real time.","[Siqueira, Vinicius Alencar; Fan, Fernando Mainardi; Dias de Paiva, Rodrigo Cauduro; Collischonn, Walter] Univ Fed Rio Grande do Sul, Inst Pesquisas Hidraul IPH, Porto Alegre, RS, Brazil; [Weerts, Albrecht] Deltares, Delft, Netherlands; [Weerts, Albrecht] Wageningen Univ WUR, Wageningen, Netherlands; [Klein, Bastian] German Fed Inst Hydrol BfG, Koblenz, Germany",,"Siqueira, VA (corresponding author), Univ Fed Rio Grande Sul UFRGS, Inst Pesquisas Hidroul IPH, Av Bento Goncalves 9500, BR-90050260 Porto Alegre, RS, Brazil.",vinisiquera@gmail.com,"Siqueira, Vinícius A/K-1499-2017","Siqueira, Vinícius A/0000-0002-1628-7101; Weerts, Albrecht/0000-0002-3249-8363","Brazilian Coordination for the Improvement of Higher Education Personnel (CAPES)Coordenacao de Aperfeicoamento de Pessoal de Nivel Superior (CAPES) [88881.189000/2018-01]; Brazilian National Council for Scientific Research (CNPq)Conselho Nacional de Desenvolvimento Cientifico e Tecnologico (CNPQ) [141450/2015, 422422/2016]","The first author would like to acknowledge the Brazilian Coordination for the Improvement of Higher Education Personnel (CAPES) (under grant number 88881.189000/2018-01, CAPES/PDSE, Programa de Doutorado Sanduiche no Exterior) and the Brazilian National Council for Scientific Research (CNPq) (under grant numbers 141450/2015 and 422422/2016, Project: South America Flood Awareness System SAFAS) for the financial support.

The model is developed to explore three innovations in hierarchical modeling for seasonal forecasting at ungaged sites: (1) predictive climate teleconnections are inferred directly from ocean fields instead of predefined climate indices, (2) a parsimonious modeling structure is introduced to allow climate teleconnections to vary spatially across streamflow gages, and (3) climate teleconnections and antecedent hydrologic conditions are considered jointly for regional forecast development. The proposed model is developed and calibrated in a hierarchical Bayesian framework to pool regional information across sites and enhance regionalization skill. The model is validated in a cross-validation framework along with five simpler nested formulations to test specific hypotheses embedded in the full model structure. Results indicate that each of the three innovations improve out-of-sample summer low-flow forecasts, with the greatest benefits derived from the spatially heterogeneous effect of climate teleconnections. We conclude with a discussion of possible model improvements from a better representation of antecedent hydrologic conditions at ungaged sites.","[Ahn, Kuk-Hyun; Steinschneider, Scott] Cornell Univ, Dept Biol & Environm Engn, Ithaca, NY 14850 USA; [Palmer, Richard] Univ Massachusetts, Dept Civil & Environm Engn, Amherst, MA 01003 USA",,"Ahn, KH (corresponding author), Cornell Univ, Dept Biol & Environm Engn, Ithaca, NY 14850 USA.",ahnkukhyun@gmail.com,,"Ahn, Kuk-Hyun/0000-0001-8142-0813",Department of Interior Northeast Climate Science Center,This research was supported by the Department of Interior Northeast Climate Science Center.

Anticipating bloom occurrence and understanding the main drivers of CyanoHABs are needed to optimize water resources management. An extensive review of the application of CyanoHABs forecasting and predictive models was performed, and a summary of the current state of knowledge, limitations and research opportunities on this topic is provided through analysis of case studies. Two modelling approaches were used to achieve CyanoHABs anticipation; process-based (PB) and data-driven (DD) models. The objective of the model was a determining factor for the choice of modelling approach. PB models were more frequently used to predict future scenarios whereas DD models were employed for short-term forecasts. Each modelling approach presented multiple variations that may be applied for more specific, targeted purposes. Most models reviewed were site-specific. The monitoring methodologies, including data frequency, uncertainty and precision, were identified as a major limitation to improve model performance. A lack of standardization of both model output and performance metrics was observed. CyanoHAB modelling is an interdisciplinary topic and communication between disciplines should be improved to facilitate model comparisons. These shortcomings can hinder the adoption of modelling tools by practitioners. We suggest that water managers should focus on generalising models for lakes with similar characteristics and where possible use high frequency monitoring for model development and validation.

The model is trained and calibrated using a historic dataset of four years (2012-2015). Predictive performance of the ARIMA model is evaluated statistically by a dataset of year 2016. Satisfactory model predictions have been obtained in the study area although some discrepancies have been observed when sharp fluctuations of water level occur. The model accuracy is explored in terms of root mean square error (RMSE), mean absolute percentage error (MAPE), percent of bias (PBIAS) and the index of agreement (d). Moreover, the influence of forecasting period on the model accuracy is further investigated. It is found that the model accuracy decreases as the forecasting period is extended. Considering the simplicity and efficiency of the ARIMA, it provides an effective way of short term water level forecasting and shows potential to be extended for alternative research aims.","[Yu, Zhen; Lei, Guoping; Liu, Fengyang] Changjiang Waterway Planning Design & Res Inst, Wuhan, Hubei, Peoples R China; [Jiang, Zhonglian] Wuhan Univ Technol, Natl Engn Res Ctr Water Transport Safety, Wuhan, Hubei, Peoples R China",,"Yu, Z (corresponding author), Changjiang Waterway Planning Design & Res Inst, Wuhan, Hubei, Peoples R China.",zhen.yu@hotmail.com; 11245229@qq.com; z.jiang@whut.edu.cn; 448170142@qq.com,,,National Key Research and Development Program of China [2016YFC0402103]; National Natural Science Foundation of ChinaNational Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC) [51709220]; Fundamental Research Funds for the Central UniversitiesFundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities [WUT: 2016IVA097],"The authors gratefully acknowledge the reviewers for their valuable comments which greatly improved the original manuscript.

Changes in landscape pattern have a considerable impact on river water quality. Precise predictions of the future landscape pattern provide strong support for manipulating land use patterns, which is beneficial for sustainable development in the watershed. The Jiulong River Basin in south-eastern China was selected as the study area. The Random Forest classifier, which combined textural characteristics with spectral information, was applied to interpret the landscapes from Landsat images acquired in 1995, 2005 and 2015 in this paper. The overall classification accuracy reached 86%, and the Kappa index was higher than 0.83, which was better than the accuracy of classifiers based on the exclusive use of spectral information. We used a hybrid cellular automaton-Markov (CA-Markov) model to simulate the landscape pattern of the Jiulong River Basin in 2015 and verified the accuracy according to the interpreted landscape classification map in 2015. The pixels that were predicted to the correct landscape account for 88.35% of total pixels, and the Kappa coefficient was 0.88, indicating that the CA-Markov model was credible for predicting the future landscape pattern in the Jiulong River Basin. The CA-Markov model was applied to forecast the landscape pattern of this watershed in 2025, and the transition area matrix from 2015 to 2025 was obtained. The predicted results demonstrated the imbalanced migration of source-sink landscapes in the future, which indicated the deterioration of water quality in the study area. Hence, government regulators need rational manipulation of the landscape pattern for sustainable development in the Jiulong River Basin.","[Zhang, X.] Chinese Acad Sci, Inst Remote Sensing & Digital Earth, State Key Lab Remote Sensing Sci, Beijing 100101, Peoples R China; [Zhou, L.] Wuhan Univ, Coll Remote Sensing Informat Engn, Wuhan 430079, Hubei, Peoples R China; [Zheng, Q.] China Univ Min & Technol Beijing, Coll Geosci & Surveying Engn, Beijing 100083, Peoples R China",,"Zhang, X (corresponding author), Chinese Acad Sci, Inst Remote Sensing & Digital Earth, State Key Lab Remote Sensing Sci, Beijing 100101, Peoples R China.",zhangxin@radi.ac.cn,,,"National Key R & D Programmes of China [2017YFB0504201]; Natural Science Foundation of ChinaNational Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC) [61473286, 61375002]",The authors would like to thank the anonymous reviewers for their constructive comments and suggestions.

The stateof-the-art methods in SD-QPF include radar extrapolations, numerical weather prediction (NWP) models, and hybrid methods that combine the two. Despite the diversity of methods that have been used, SD-QPF remains difficult: even sophisticated methods may not be able to consistently outperform relatively simple baselines such as Persistence. Methods in Deep Learning (DL) have demonstrated significant and often unexpected improvements across a wide variety of domains ranging from image and video processing to machine translation and speech recognition. Emerging research has suggested that that DL may improve point predictions in the context of very short-term - 0-2 hours - distributed QPF (VSD-QPF) by taking advantage of growing data from in-situ weather sensors as well as remote sensors such as radar and satellites, along with advances in computing. Here we examine the hypothesis that DL can improve VSD-QPF, specifically point predictions, based on observed hourly precipitation data over the contiguous United States, by leveraging a Convolutional Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) recurrent neural network for 1-hour precipitation nowcasting.

The empirical model was then applied to 251 Small Satellite Constellation for Environment and Disaster Monitoring and Forecasting loaded with the Charge Coupled Device (HJ-CCD) images to derive TSM distribution maps from 2009 to 2018. The estimated TSM concentrations exhibited significant spatial and seasonal changes, revealing relationships among TSM, wind speed, and precipitation. The spatial heterogeneity was significantly higher downstream than upstream in the reservoir due to watershed inputs and anthropogenic dredging activity. The temporal heterogeneity of TSM, significantly higher in summer and autumn than in winter and spring, was mainly caused by seasonal rainfall.

The proposed EMD-SVM has three important stages. The first stage, the data were decomposed into several numbers of Intrinsic Mode Functions (IMF) and a residual using EMD technique. In the second stage, the meaningful signals are identified using a statistical measure and the new dataset are obtained in this stage. The final stage applied SVM as forecasting tool to perform the river flow forecasting. To assess the effectiveness of EMD-SVM model, Selangor and Bernam Rivers were used as case studies.

The projection of future precipitation in this basin is essential for understanding the challenges. In this study, the Weather Research and Forecasting (WRF) model was applied to project the LMRB precipitation. Comparing with the historical period (1986-2005), we analyzed the changes of both the projected precipitation amount and the frequency of rainless (<0.1 mm d(-1)), light rain (0.1-10 mm d(-1)), moderate rain (10-25 mm d(-1)), heavy rain (25-50 mm d(-1)), rainstorm (50-100 mm d(-1)), and heavy rainstorm (>100 mm d(-1)) for three periods, namely the near-term (2016-2035), mid-term (2046-2065), and long-term (2080-2099). The results indicate that the precipitation amount during the wet season (April-October) is expected to increase in most areas of the basin for the three periods. As for the precipitation during the dry season (November-March), an increase is projected in most areas for the near-term, while an increase in the lower reach of the basin and a decrease in the upper and middle reach for the mid-term and long-term. The precipitation reduction is expected to be greatest in Myanmar, Laos, Thailand, and Yunnan province of China for the mid-term. The frequency of precipitation in different intensities has prominent regional and temporal differences. During the wet season, the days of rainless and light rain are expected to decrease in the middle reach, whereas the days of rainstorm and heavy rainstorm increase. This feature is especially strong in southern Thailand, southern Laos and Cambodia in the near-term and in Laos and Thailand for the mid-term and long-term. During the dry season, there are projected increasing rainless days and decreasing days of precipitation for the other intensities in the middle reach, and opposite in the rest area of the basin. These projected precipitation changes have potential various impact in different parts of the basin. The middle reach would likely face increasing flood risks because of more days of rainstorm and heavy rainstorm, as well as more precipitation. Yunnan, Myanmar, Thailand and Laos would probably be the center of drought threatens during the dry season due to the increment of rainless days and the precipitation reduction. Besides, the seawater intrusion during the dry season in the near-term and mid-term would be more serious as a result of the precipitation decrease in southern Vietnam.","[Sun Chang; Xiao Zi-Niu] Chinese Acad Sci, Inst Atmospher Phys, State Key Lab Numer Modeling Atmospher Sci & Geop, Beijing 100029, Peoples R China; [Sun Chang; Xiao Zi-Niu] Univ Chinese Acad Sci, Coll Earth & Planetary Sci, Beijing 100049, Peoples R China; [Minh Nguyen] Australias Commonwealth Sci & Ind Res Org, Land & Water, Clayton, Vic 3168, Australia",,"Xiao, ZN (corresponding author), Chinese Acad Sci, Inst Atmospher Phys, State Key Lab Numer Modeling Atmospher Sci & Geop, Beijing 100029, Peoples R China.",xiaozn@lasg.iap.ac.cn,,"Nguyen, Minh/0000-0001-9686-875X",Li Chongyin Academician Workstation of Yunnan province; National Natural Science Foundation of ChinaNational Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC) [U1902209]; Chinese Academy of SciencesChinese Academy of Sciences; Key Science Foundation of Yunnan Province [2016FA041]; External Cooperation Program of Bureau of International Cooperation [GJHZ1729]; Science and Technology Project of SGCC (State Grid Corporation of China) [Research and application of multi-spatial scale variation of photovoltaic output characteristics considering complex factors such as cloud and floating dust] [NY71-19-013],"We thank Sun Jian-Qi and Yu En-Tao for providing the model data, and the support from Li Chongyin Academician Workstation of Yunnan province.

In this study, the SWAT model is applied to the Narmada river basin to estimate the surface runoff. The capability of the model is tested for the south west monsoon season (June-September) of 2016 and validated against the NCUM global NWP model forecast data up to Day-5. Two heavy rainfall events are used for verification of the global model forecast with the observed data. The two verification events occurring during 1 July to 15 July (mean of 15 days) and 30 Aug to 11 Sept (mean of 12 days) are considered. Using Arc GIS sub watershed boundaries, the drainage network, slope, land use map and soil map are generated for the whole Narmada river basin. The surface runoff is computed by forcing with observed rainfall data as well as the NCUM model rainfall forecasts data as input to the SWAT model. Model simulations are compared at five stations of Narmada namely-Balkheri, Sandia, Handia, Hoshangabad and Garudeshwar. Initially, the NCUM model rainfall forecast is compared with the actual observation to evaluate the model performances in terms of bias estimation. Then the surface runoff is computed using the observed rainfall data and NCUM forecast data up to Day-5 and made a comparison to evaluate the SWAT model performances. It is shown that the estimated surface runoff during the two active phases is simulated well with some overestimation during the season. The skill of hydrological simulations is examined during different length of forecasts. It is seen that the SWAT model output performance is related to the NWP rainfall forecast skills. NCUM global NWP model is overestimating rainfall amount (wet bias) by 50-70 mm/day over the basin during the two active phases. Further, in all the days' forecasts, the model is showing wet bias over the upper part of the Narmada river basin and a dry bias over the lower part of the basin. The dry bias is seen to be around 5-35 mm/day.","[Goswami, Suresh Band; Bal, Prasanta Kumar; Mitra, Ashis K.] Minist Earth Sci, NCMRWF, Sect 62, Noida 201309, UP, India",,"Goswami, SB (corresponding author), Minist Earth Sci, NCMRWF, Sect 62, Noida 201309, UP, India.",s.goswami10@gmail.com,,,,,,21,2,2,0,2,SPRINGER HEIDELBERG,HEIDELBERG,"TIERGARTENSTRASSE 17, D-69121 HEIDELBERG, GERMANY",2363-6203,2363-6211,,MODEL EARTH SYST ENV,Model.

As the index of Forecast-Based Operation (FBO), the forecasted factor plays an important part in determining success or failure of FBO due to its uncertainty and accuracy. In this study, possible risk sources were analyzed considering the process and the characteristics of reservoir flood regulation firstly, and the uncertainty of the forecast information and the FBO risks were discussed based on hypothesis testing. Then, combined with the case study of applying FBO on Ankang Reservoir, in which the forecasted net rainfall was selected as the index of the FBO rules, the probability distribution of the forecasted net rainfall errors was derived as the basis of risk analysis. Finally, FBO risk analysis was conducted based on Monte Carlo method for several real flood processes, while a simulation was also carried out with the Conventional Operation (CO) for contrast. The results indicate that the maximum risk was reduced more than half when FBO was adopted. Consequently, the possible remedial measures were put forward in the case of invalid forecast happened based on simulation and the analysis of the principle of flood regulation. The conclusions and methods in this research provide ideas for real-time flood regulation and risk management of reservoirs.","[Liu, Zhao; Lyu, Jiawei; Jia, Zhifeng; Xu, Bin] Changan Univ, Sch Environm Sci & Engn, 126 Yanta Rd, Xian 710054, Shaanxi, Peoples R China; [Liu, Zhao; Lyu, Jiawei; Jia, Zhifeng; Xu, Bin] Changan Univ, Minist Educ, Key Lab Subsurface Hydrol & Ecol Effects Arid Reg, 126 Yanta Rd, Xian 710054, Shaanxi, Peoples R China; [Wang, Lixia] Changan Univ, Sch Earth Sci & Resources, 126 Yanta Rd, Xian 710054, Shaanxi, Peoples R China",,"Jia, ZF (corresponding author), Changan Univ, Sch Environm Sci & Engn, 126 Yanta Rd, Xian 710054, Shaanxi, Peoples R China.; Jia, ZF (corresponding author), Changan Univ, Minist Educ, Key Lab Subsurface Hydrol & Ecol Effects Arid Reg, 126 Yanta Rd, Xian 710054, Shaanxi, Peoples R China.",lz975@chd.edu.cn; 2017129022@chd.edu.cn; 409538088@chd.edu.cn; zylxwang@chd.edu.cn; xubin@chd.edu.cn,"; Liu, Zhao/F-6937-2014","JIA, Zhifeng/0000-0003-0800-9352; Liu, Zhao/0000-0002-3384-8484","key research and development project of Shaanxi Province [2019SF-237]; Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities, CHD [300102299206, 300102269201]; Xi'an Construction Science and Technology Planning Project [SJW2017-11]","This research was funded by the key research and development project of Shaanxi Province (No. 2019SF-237), the Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities, CHD (Program Nos. 300102299206 and 300102269201), and the Xi'an Construction Science and Technology Planning Project (SJW2017-11).",,35,2,3,4,10,MDPI,BASEL,"ST ALBAN-ANLAGE 66, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND",2073-4441,,,WATER-SUI,Water,JUN,2019,11,6,,,,,,,,10.3390/w11061134,,,14,Environmental Sciences; Water Resources,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),Environmental Sciences & Ecology; Water Resources,II7BC,WOS:000475346300022,,"Green Submitted, gold",,,2022-02-17

Machine learning (ML) models have become widely prevalent in capturing the complexity of reservoir inflow time-series data. However, the model structure's selection required several trails-and-error processes to identify the optimal architecture to capture the necessary information of various patterns of input-output mapping. In this study, the effectiveness of a deep learning (DL) approach in capturing various input-output patterns is examined and applied to reservoir inflow forecasting. The proposed DL approach has a distinct benefit over classical ML models as all the hidden layers are stacked afterward to train on a diverging set of topologies derived from the previous layer's output. Given the nonlinearity of day-to-day data about reservoir inflow, a deep learning algorithm centered on the long short-term memory (LSTM) and two standard machine learning algorithms, namely support vector machine (SVM) and artificial neural network (ANN), were deployed in this study for forecasting reservoir inflow on a daily basis. The gathered data pertained to historical daily inflow from 01/01/2018 to 31/12/2019. The area of study was Durian Tunggal Reservoir, Melaka, Peninsular Malaysia. The choice of the input set was made on the basis of the autocorrelation function. The formulated model was assessed on the basis of statistical indices, such as mean absolute error (MAE), root mean square error (RMSE), and the coefficient of determination (R-2). The outcomes indicate that the LSTM model performed much better than SVM and ANN. Based on the comparison, LSTM outperformed other models with MAE = 0.088, RMSE = 0.27, and R-2 = 0.91. This research demonstrates that the deep learning technique is an appropriate method for estimating the daily inflow of the Durian Tunggal Reservoir, unlike the standard machine learning models.","[Latif, Sarmad Dashti] Komar Univ Sci & Technol, Coll Engn, Civil Engn Dept, Sulaimany 46001, Kurdistan Regio, Iraq; [Ahmed, Ali Najah] Univ Tenaga Nas, Inst Energy Infrastruct IEI, Kajang 43000, Selangor, Malaysia; [Sathiamurthy, Edlic] Univ Malaysia Terengganu, Fac Sci & Marine Environm, Terengganu, Malaysia; [Huang, Yuk Feng] Univ Tunku Abdul Rahman, Lee Kong Chian Fac Engn & Sci, Dept Civil Engn, Kajang, Selangor, Malaysia; [El-Shafie, Ahmed] Univ Malaya UM, Fac Engn, Dept Civil Engn, Kuala Lumpur 50603, Malaysia; [El-Shafie, Ahmed] United Arab Emirates Univ, Natl Water & Energy Ctr, POB 15551, Al Ain, U Arab Emirates",,"Ahmed, AN (corresponding author), Univ Tenaga Nas, Inst Energy Infrastruct IEI, Kajang 43000, Selangor, Malaysia.",sarmad.latif@komar.edu.iq; Mahfoodh@uniten.edu.my; edlic@umt.edu.my; huangyf@utar.edu.my; elshafie@um.edu.my,"Latif, Sarmad Dashti/ABD-4755-2020","Latif, Sarmad Dashti/0000-0002-0417-3545",Ministry of Education (MOE) through Fundamental Research Grant Scheme (FRGS) [FRGS/1/2019/TK01/UNITEN/02/3],"This research was supported by Ministry of Education (MOE) through Fundamental Research Grant Scheme (FRGS, Grant No.: FRGS/1/2019/TK01/UNITEN/02/3).

Hydropower systems present multiple advantages since they provide sustainable and controllable energy. However, hydropower plants' effectiveness is affected by multiple factors such as river/reservoir inflows, temperature, electricity price, among others. The mentioned factors make the prediction and recommendation of a station's operational output a difficult challenge. Therefore, reliable and accurate energy production forecasts are vital and of great importance for capacity planning, scheduling, and power systems operation. This research aims to develop and apply artificial neural network (ANN) models to predict hydroelectric production in Ecuador's short and medium term, considering historical data such as hydropower production and precipitations. For this purpose, two scenarios based on the prediction horizon have been considered, i.e., one-step and multi-step forecasted problems. Sixteen ANN structures based on multilayer perceptron (MLP), long short-term memory (LSTM), and sequence-to-sequence (seq2seq) LSTM were designed. More than 3000 models were configured, trained, and validated using a grid search algorithm based on hyperparameters. The results show that the MLP univariate and differentiated model of one-step scenario outperforms the other architectures analyzed in both scenarios. The obtained model can be an important tool for energy planning and decision-making for sustainable hydropower production.","[Barzola-Monteses, Julio; Gomez-Romero, Juan; Fajardo, Waldo] Univ Granada, Escuela Tecn Super Ingn Informat & Telecomun, Dept Comp Sci & Artificial Intelligence, Granada 1807, Spain; [Barzola-Monteses, Julio] Univ Guayaquil, Artificial Intelligence & Informat Technol Res Gr, Guayaquil 090514, Ecuador; [Espinoza-Andaluz, Mayken] Escuela Super Politecn Litoral, Fac Ingn Mecan & Ciencias Prod, Ctr Energias Renovables & Alternat, Guayaquil 09015863, Ecuador",,"Barzola-Monteses, J (corresponding author), Univ Granada, Escuela Tecn Super Ingn Informat & Telecomun, Dept Comp Sci & Artificial Intelligence, Granada 1807, Spain.; Barzola-Monteses, J (corresponding author), Univ Guayaquil, Artificial Intelligence & Informat Technol Res Gr, Guayaquil 090514, Ecuador.",jbarzola@correo.ugr.es,"Barzola-Monteses, Julio/N-5387-2019","Barzola-Monteses, Julio/0000-0003-2732-979X","University of Guayaquil; University of Granada; Spanish Ministry of Science, Innovation and UniversitiesSpanish Government [TIN2017-91223- EXP]; Spanish Ministry of Economy and CompetitivenessSpanish Government [TIN2015-64776-C3-1-R]","The authors kindly acknowledge the support from University of Guayaquil.

The present research study introduces an ensemble gene expression programming (EGEP) modeling approach to 1- and 2-day ahead streamflow forecasts that meet both accuracy and simplicity criteria of an applied model. Three main components of the proposed EGEP approach which are capable of producing a parsimonious model include (i) creating a population of suitable solutions using classic genetic programming (GP) instead of a single solution, (ii) combining the solutions throughout gene expression programming, and (iii) parsimony selection based upon trade-off analysis between the complexity and accuracy of the best-evolved solutions at the holdout validation set. The EGEP model was trained and verified using the streamflow measurements from the Shahrchay River lying northwest of Iran.

Its utility for end-users is assessed through the analysis of economic value curve areas (EVA). Firstly, we have built monthly multiple linear regression (MLR) models for the in-flow, out-flow and volume anomalies by identifying the underlying relationships between these predictands and their potential predictors, both meteorological and human influenced: rainfall, maximum and minimum temperatures, reservoir volume and discharge. Subsequently, we have forecast the monthly anomalies with these models for the period 1981-2010 (up to seven months ahead). We have tested the aforementioned models with four strategies in a leave-one-out cross-validation procedure (LOOCV): a) Climatology (Clim.), b) persistence (Pers.), c) antecedent observations + climatology (A + Clim.), d) antecedent observations + European Centre for Medium-range Weather Forecasts (ECMWF) System 4 anomalies (A + S4). Climatology is the operational strategy against which the other approximations are compared. The second and third approaches only use observations as input data. Finally, the last one combines both observations and ECMWF System 4 forecasts. The LOOCV revealed that reservoir volume is the variable best described by the MLR models, followed by in-flow and out-flow anomalies. In the case of volume anomalies, the predictability displayed provides added value with respect to climatology with a minimum of four months in advance. For in-flow and out-flow this is true at one month ahead, and regarding the latter variable we encounter enhanced predictability also at longer horizons for the summer months, when water demands peak (a valuable result for end-users). Hence, there is a window of opportunity to develop future operational frameworks that could outperform the use of climatology for these variables and forecast horizons. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V.

Many studies have been conducted to evaluate the performance of hydrological forecasts, that is, streamflow. Nevertheless, only few studies evaluated the performance of hydrological drought forecasts. The objective of this study, therefore, is to analyse the skill and robustness of meteorological and hydrological drought forecasts on a catchment scale (the Ter and Llobregat rivers in Catalonia, Spain), rather than on a continental or global scale. Meteorological droughts were forecasted using downscaled (5 km) probabilistic weather reforecasts (ECMWF-SEAS4). These downscaled data were also used to produce hydrological drought forecasts, derived from time series of streamflow data simulated with a hydrological model (LISFLOOD). This resulted in seasonal hydro-meteorological reforecasts with a lead time up to 7 months, for the time period 2002-2010. These monthly reforecasts were compared to two datasets: (1) droughts derived from a proxy for observed data, including gridded precipitation data and discharge simulated by the LISFLOOD model, fed by these gridded climatological data; and (2) droughts derived from in situ observed precipitation and discharge. Results showed that the skill of hydrological drought forecasts is higher than the climatology, up to 3-4 months lead time. On the contrary, meteorological drought forecasts, analysed using the Standardized Precipitation Index (SPI), do not show added value for short accumulation times (SPI1 and SPI3). The robustness analysis showed that using either a less extreme or a more extreme threshold leads to a large change in forecasting skill, which points at a rather low robustness of the hydrological drought forecasts. Because the skill found in hydrological drought forecasts is higher than the meteorological ones in this case study, the use of hydrological drought forecasts in Catalonia is highly recommended for management of water resources.","[Van Hateren, Theresa C.] Luxembourg Inst Sci & Technol, Dept Environm Res & Innovat, Remote Sensing & Nat Resources Modelling, 41 Rue Brill, L-4422 Belvaux, Luxembourg; [Van Hateren, Theresa C.; Sutanto, Samuel J.; Van Lanen, Henny A.

This research presents an evaluation framework, where the skills of the Global Flood Awareness System (GloFAS) are assessed in Peru for the years 2009-2015. Simulated GloFAS discharges are compared against observed ones for 10 river gauges. Forecasts skills are assessed from two perspectives: (i) by calculating verification scores at every river section against simulated discharges and (ii) by comparing the flood signals against reported events. On average, river sections with higher discharges and larger upstream areas perform better. Raw forecasts provide correct flood signals for 82% of the reported floods, but exhibit low verification scores. Post-processing of raw forecasts improves most verification scores, but reduces the percentage of the correctly forecasted reported events to 65%.","[Bischiniotis, Konstantinos; van den Hurk, Bart; de Perez, Erin Coughlan; Aerts, Jeroen C.

In this study, an effective data-driven model for surface water quality prediction is developed to analyze the inherent water quality variation tendencies and provide real-time early warnings according to the historical observation data. The developed data-driven model is integrated by an improved genetic algorithm (IGA) for selecting optimal initial weight parameters of neural a network and a back-propagation neural network (BPNN) for adjusting appropriate connection architectures of neural network. First, improved genetic algorithm is used to optimize the reasonable initial weight parameters and prevent the developed model from selecting a local optimal result. Second, BPNN is applied to adjust appropriate connection architectures and identify the features of water quality variation. The developed model is then applied to forecast the surface water quality variations for real-time early warning in Ashi River, China, comparing with simple BPNN model. The prediction results demonstrate that the developed data-driven model can significantly improve the prediction performance both in prediction accuracy and reliability, and effectively provide real-time early warning for emergency response.","[Jin, Tao] Harbin Engn Univ, Coll Comp Sci & Technol, Harbin 150001, Heilongjiang, Peoples R China; [Jin, Tao] Qiqihar Univ, Coll Comp & Control Engn, Qiqihar 161006, Peoples R China; [Cai, Shaobin] Huaqiao Univ, Coll Comp Sci & Technol, Xiamen 361021, Fujian, Peoples R China; [Jiang, Dexun] Harbin Univ, Sch Informat Engn, Harbin 150086, Heilongjiang, Peoples R China; [Liu, Jie] Harbin Inst Technol, Sch Environm, State Key Lab Urban Water Resource & Environm, Harbin 150090, Heilongjiang, Peoples R China",,"Cai, SB (corresponding author), Huaqiao Univ, Coll Comp Sci & Technol, Xiamen 361021, Fujian, Peoples R China.; Liu, J (corresponding author), Harbin Inst Technol, Sch Environm, State Key Lab Urban Water Resource & Environm, Harbin 150090, Heilongjiang, Peoples R China.",caishaobin@hqu.edu.cn; liujie_198805@163.com,,"Liu, Jie/0000-0001-9071-1823",Heilongjiang Natural Science FoundationNatural Science Foundation of Heilongjiang Province [F2017029]; Fundamental Research Funds in Heilongjiang Provincial Universities [135109246]; Youth Science Fund of Heilongjiang Province of China [QC2017079]; China Postdoctoral Science FoundationChina Postdoctoral Science Foundation [2018 M631935],"This research was supported by Heilongjiang Natural Science Foundation (Grant No. F2017029), the Fundamental Research Funds in Heilongjiang Provincial Universities (Grant No. 135309356), Youth Science Fund of Heilongjiang Province of China (Grant No. QC2017079), the Fundamental Research Funds in Heilongjiang Provincial Universities (Grant No. 135109246), and the China Postdoctoral Science Foundation (Grant No. 2018 M631935).",,31,18,19,10,48,SPRINGER HEIDELBERG,HEIDELBERG,"TIERGARTENSTRASSE 17, D-69121 HEIDELBERG, GERMANY",0944-1344,1614-7499,,ENVIRON SCI POLLUT R,Environ.

The inaccurate predictions can lead to negative effects. Cimanuk watershed is one of the main pillar of water resources in West Java. This watersheds divided into three parts, which is a headwater of Cimanuk sub-watershed, Middle of Cimanuk sub-watershed and downstream of Cimanuk subwatershed. The flow of this watershed will flow through the Jatigede reservoir and will supply water to the north-coast area in the next few years. So, the reliable model of rainfall prediction is very needed in this watershed. Rainfall prediction conducted with Canonical Correlation Analysis (CCA) method using Climate Predictability Tool (CPT) software. The prediction is every 3months on 2016 (after January) based on Climate Hazards group Infrared Precipitation with Stations (CHIRPS) data over West Java. Predictors used in CPT were the monthly data index of Nino3.4, Dipole Mode (DMI), and Monsoon Index (AUSMI-ISMI-WNPMI-WYMI) with initial condition January. The initial condition is chosen by the last data update. While, the predictant were monthly rainfall data CHIRPS region of West Java. The results of prediction rainfall showed by skill map from Pearson Correlation. High correlation of skill map are on MAM (Mar-Apr-May), AMJ (Apr-May-Jun), and JJA (Jun-Jul-Aug) which means the model is reliable to forecast rainfall distribution over Cimanuk watersheds region (over West Java) on those seasons. CCA score over those season prediction mostly over 0.7. The accuracy of the model CPT also indicated by the Relative Operating Characteristic (ROC) curve of the results of Pearson correlation 3 representative point of sub-watershed (Sumedang, Majalengka, and Cirebon), were mostly located in the top line of non-skill, and evidenced by the same of rainfall patterns between observation and forecast. So, the model of CPT with CCA method is reliable to use.","[Rustiana, Shailla] Univ Padjadjaran, Dept Appl Stat, Bandung, Indonesia; [Rustiana, Shailla] Natl Inst Aeronaut & Space LAPAN Bandung, Bandung, Indonesia; [Ruchjana, Budi Nurani] Univ Padjadjaran, Fac Math & Nat Sci, Dept Math, Bandung, Indonesia; [Abdullah, Atje Setiawan] Univ Padjadjaran, Fac Math & Nat Sci, Dept Comp Sci, Bandung, Indonesia; [Hermawan, Eddy; Krismianto] Natl Inst Aeronaut & Space LAPAN, Ctr Atmospher Sci, Bandung, Indonesia; [Hermawan, Eddy; Krismianto] Natl Inst Aeronaut & Space LAPAN, Technol Ctr, Bandung, Indonesia; [Sipayung, Sinta Berliana; Jaya, I.

Application of the scheme was demonstrated over 23 dams in U.S. with varying hydrological characteristics and climate regimes. Probabilistic forecast was also explored by feeding ANN with ensembles of weather forecast fields. Results suggest forecasting skill improves with decreasing coefficient of variation in inflow and increasing drainage area. Forecast-informed operations were simulated using a rolling horizon scheme and assessed against benchmark control rules. Over two years of operations from Pensacola dam (Oklahoma), additional 47,253 MWh of energy could have been harvested without compromising flood risk with optimal operations. This study reinforces the potential of a numerically efficient and skillful reservoir inflow forecasting scheme to address water-energy security challenges.","[Ahmad, Shahryar Khalique; Hussain, Faisal] Univ Washington, Dept Civil & Environm Engn, More Hall 201, Seattle, WA 98195 USA",,"Hussain, F (corresponding author), Univ Washington, Dept Civil & Environm Engn, More Hall 201, Seattle, WA 98195 USA.",fhossain@uw.edu,"Ahmad, Shahryar/AAM-5612-2021",,,,,70,20,20,3,32,ELSEVIER SCI LTD,OXFORD,"THE BOULEVARD, LANGFORD LANE, KIDLINGTON, OXFORD OX5 1GB, OXON, ENGLAND",1364-8152,1873-6726,,ENVIRON MODELL SOFTW,Environ.

The interrelationship between several climate indices is assessed with the monthly percentiles of soil water storage (SW), precipitation (PCP), surface run-off (SURQ), and potential evapotranspiration (PET) for 50 watersheds in the South Atlantic Gulf region of the SEUS. The hydrologic variables are simulated by implementing SWAT models for each watershed at a HUC-12 resolution for a period of January 1982 through December 2013. The study highlights the strong correlation between the climate indices and watershed-scale hydrologic variables and provides important insights on the effect of seasonality and the dynamics of water balance components on the predictability of drought at watershed-scale. Among all hydrologic variables evaluated, soil moisture shows a stronger relationship with the climate indices compared to PCP, SW, and SURQ. The interrelationship between watershed hydrology and climate indices is found to be stronger during fall (September-November) and winter seasons (December-February) with high correlation of SW and PCP with the climate indices, especially in the Carolinas, Georgia, and parts of Florida. Simulated SW corresponds strongly with the Palmer drought severity index (PDSI) in terms of its response to climate indices, indicating that SW can be an effective predictor of drought in the region.","[Sehgal, Vinit; Sridhar, Venkataramana] Virginia Polytech Inst & State Univ, Dept Biol Syst Engn, Blacksburg, VA 24060 USA; [Sehgal, Vinit] Texas A&M Univ, Water Management & Hydrol Sci, College Stn, TX USA",,"Sridhar, V (corresponding author), Virginia Polytech Inst & State Univ, Dept Biol Syst Engn, Blacksburg, VA 24060 USA.",vsri@vt.edu,"Sehgal, Vinit/H-5848-2018; Sridhar, Venkat/AAT-6676-2020","Sehgal, Vinit/0000-0002-8837-5864; Sridhar, Venkat/0000-0002-1003-2247",,,,65,10,10,3,12,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0899-8418,1097-0088,,INT J CLIMATOL,Int.

In this study, we have used hundreds of observations to verify global and regional model forecasts of atmospheric rivers making landfall in Northern California and offshore in the midlatitude northeast Pacific Ocean. We have characterized forecast error and the predictability limit in AR water vapor transport, static stability, onshore precipitation, and standard atmospheric fields. Analysis is also presented that apportions the role of orographic forcing and precipitation response in driving errors in forecast precipitation after AR landfall. It is found that the global model and the higher-resolution regional model reach their predictability limit in forecasting the atmospheric state during ARs at similar lead times, and both present similar and important errors in low-level water vapor flux, moist-static stability, and precipitation. However, the relative contribution of forcing and response to the incurred precipitation error is very different in the two models. It can be demonstrated using the analysis presented herein that improving water vapor transport accuracy can significantly reduce regional model precipitation errors during ARs, while the same cannot be demonstrated for the global model.","[Martin, Andrew; Ralph, F.

Based on a combination of localized operation outputs of Chinese climate models and imported forecast data of some international operational models, the National Climate Center of the China Meteorological Administration has established the China multi-model ensemble prediction system version 1.0 (CMMEv1.0) for monthly-seasonal prediction of primary climate variability modes and climate elements. We verified the real-time forecasts of CMMEv1.0 for the 2018 flood season (June-August) starting from March 2018 and evaluated the 1991-2016 hindcasts of CMMEv1.0. The results show that CMMEv1.0 has a significantly high prediction skill for global sea surface temperature (SST) anomalies, especially for the El Nino-Southern Oscillation (EN-SO) in the tropical central-eastern Pacific. Additionally, its prediction skill for the North Atlantic SST triple (NAST) mode is high, but is relatively low for the Indian Ocean Dipole (IOD) mode. Moreover, CMMEv1.0 has high skills in predicting the western Pacific subtropical high (WPSH) and East Asian summer monsoon (EASM) in the June-July-August (JJA) season. The JJA air temperature in the CMMEv1.0 is predicted with a fairly high skill in most regions of China, while the JJA precipitation exhibits some skills only in northwestern and eastern China. For real-time forecasts in March-August 2018, CMMEv1.0 has accurately predicted the ENSO phase transition from cold to neutral in the tropical central-eastern Pacific and captures evolutions of the NAST and IOD indices in general. The system has also captured the main features of the summer WPSH and EASM indices in 2018, except that the predicted EASM is slightly weaker than the observed. Furthermore, CMMEv1.0 has also successfully predicted warmer air temperatures in northern China and captured the primary rainbelt over northern China, except that it predicted much more precipitation in the middle and lower reaches of the Yangtze River than observation.","[Ren, Hong-Li; Wu, Yujie; Liu, Changzheng; Wan, Jianghua; Liu, Ying; Tian, Ben] China Meteorol Adm, Natl Climate Ctr, Lab Climate Studies, Beijing 100081, Peoples R China; [Ren, Hong-Li; Wu, Yujie; Liu, Changzheng; Wan, Jianghua; Liu, Ying; Tian, Ben] China Meteorol Adm, Natl Climate Ctr, China Meteorol Adm Nanjing Univ Joint Lab Climate, Beijing 100081, Peoples R China; [Bao, Qing] Chinese Acad Sci, Inst Atmospher Phys, State Key Lab Numer Modeling Atmospher Sci & Geop, Beijing, Peoples R China; [Ma, Jiehua; Sun, Jianqi] Chinese Acad Sci, Inst Atmospher Phys, Nansen Zhu Int Res Ctr, Beijing 100029, Peoples R China; [Li, Qiaoping] China Meteorol Adm, Natl Climate Ctr, Beijing 100081, Peoples R China; [Wu, Xiaofei] Chengdu Univ Informat Technol, Sch Atmospher Sci, Plateau Atmosphere & Environm Key Lab Sichuan Pro, Chengdu 610225, Sichuan, Peoples R China; [Fu, Joshua-Xiouhua] Fudan Univ, Inst Atmospher Sci, Shanghai 200433, Peoples R China",,"Ren, HL (corresponding author), China Meteorol Adm, Natl Climate Ctr, Lab Climate Studies, Beijing 100081, Peoples R China.; Ren, HL (corresponding author), China Meteorol Adm, Natl Climate Ctr, China Meteorol Adm Nanjing Univ Joint Lab Climate, Beijing 100081, Peoples R China.",renhl@cma.gov.cn,"Liu, Ying/AAX-2412-2020; Bao, Qing/A-7765-2012","Bao, Qing/0000-0003-1719-6540; WU, Xiaofei/0000-0002-4797-1256","National Key Research and Development Program of China [2017YFC1502306, 2017YFC1502302, 2018YFC1506004]; China Meteorological Administration Special Project for Developing Key Techniques for Operational Meteorological Forecast [YBGJXM201805]","Supported by the National Key Research and Development Program of China (2017YFC1502306, 2017YFC1502302, and 2018YFC1506004) and China Meteorological Administration Special Project for Developing Key Techniques for Operational Meteorological Forecast (YBGJXM201805).",,79,12,15,2,15,SPRINGER HEIDELBERG,HEIDELBERG,"TIERGARTENSTRASSE 17, D-69121 HEIDELBERG, GERMANY",2095-6037,2198-0934,,J METEOROL RES-PRC,J.

However, detailed snowmelt modeling is hampered by limited input data and uncertainty arising from inadequate model structure and parametrization. Data assimilation that updates model states based on observations, reduces uncertainty and improves streamflow forecasts. In this study, we evaluated the Utah Energy Balance (UEB) snowmelt model coupled to the Sacramento Soil Moisture Accounting (SAC-SMA) and rutpix7 stream routing models, integrated within the Research Distributed Hydrologic Model (RDHM) framework for streamflow forecasting. We implemented an ensemble Kalman filter for assimilation of snow water equivalent (SWE) observations in UEB and a particle filter for assimilation of streamflow to update the SAC-SMA and rutpix7 states. Using leave one out validation, it was shown that the modeled SWE at a location where observations were excluded from data assimilation was improved through assimilation of data from other stations, suggesting that assimilation of sparse observations of SWE has the potential to improve the distributed modeling of SWE over watershed grid cells. In addition, the spatially distributed snow data assimilation improved streamflow forecasts and the forecast volume error was reduced. On the other hand, the assimilation of streamflow observations did not provide additional forecast improvement over that achieved by the SWE assimilation for seasonal forecast volume likely due to there being little information content in streamflow at the forecast date prior to its rising during the melt period and this application of particle filter being better suited for shorter timescales.","[Gichamo, Tseganeh Z.; Tarboton, David G.] Utah State Univ, Utah Water Res Lab, Logan, UT 84322 USA",,"Tarboton, DG (corresponding author), Utah State Univ, Utah Water Res Lab, Logan, UT 84322 USA.",david.tarboton@usu.edu,"Tarboton, David/G-8972-2011","Tarboton, David/0000-0002-1998-3479; Gichamo, Tseganeh Zekiewos/0000-0001-5377-9482",NASA award [NNH15CM90C],"This work was supported by the NASA award NNH15CM90C.

However, conservative estimates of the available resource in rivers and reservoirs may lead to unnecessary curtailments in allocated water due to conservative estimates of future (in) flows. Water allocations may be revised as the season progresses, though inconsistency in allocation is undesirable to farmers as they may then not be able to use that water, thus leading to an opportunity cost in agricultural production. In this study we assess the benefit of using reservoir inflow estimates derived from seasonal forecast datasets to improve water allocation decisions. A feedback loop between simulated reservoir storage and emulated water allocations to General Security (water allocated to irrigating) was developed to evaluate two seasonal reservoir inflow forecast datasets (POAMA and ESP), derived from the Forecast Guided Stochastic Scenarios (FoGSS), a 12 month seasonal ensemble forecast in Australia. We evaluate the approach in the Murrumbidgee basin, comparing water allocations obtained with an expected reservoir inflow from FoGSS against the allocations obtained with an expected reservoir inflow from a conservative estimate based on climatology (as currently used by the basin authority), as well as against those obtained using observed inflows (perfect information). The inconsistency in allocated water is evaluated by determining the total changes in allocated water made every 15 days from the initial allocation at the start of the water year to the end of the irrigation season, including both downward and upward revisions of allocations. Results show that the inconsistency due to upward revisions in allocated water is lower when using the forecast datasets (POAMA and ESP) compared to the conservative inflow estimates (reference) which is beneficial to the planning of cropping areas by farmers. Over confidence can, however, lead to an increase in undesirable downward revisions. This is more evident for dry years than for wet years. Even though biases are found in inflow predictions, the accuracy of the available water estimates using the forecast ensemble improves progressively during the water year, especially one and a half months before the start of the cropping season in November, providing additional time for farmers to make key decision on planting.",,,,,,,,,,0,0,0,0,0,CRC PRESS-BALKEMA,LEIDEN,"PO BOX 11320, LEIDEN,  South Holland, NETHERLANDS",,,978-94-6395-008-4; 978-0-367-42955-3,,,,2019,,,,,,,83,113,,,10.18174/479159,,31,"Mathematics, Applied; Water Resources",Book Citation Index – Science (BKCI-S),Mathematics; Water Resources,BO8EN,WOS:000526932400006,,"Green Published, Bronze",,,2022-02-17

This study developed a flood routing model combined with a particle filter-based assimilation model and a one-dimensional hydrodynamic model. This model was applied to an indoor micro-model, using the Lower Yellow River (LYR) as prototype. Real-time observations of the water level from the micro-model were used for data assimilation. The results show that, compared to the traditional hydrodynamic model, the assimilation model could effectively update water level, flow discharge, and roughness coefficient in real time, thus yielding improved results. The mean water levels of the particle posterior distribution are closer to the observed values than before assimilation, even when water levels change greatly. In addition, the calculation results for different lead times indicate that the root mean square error of the forecasting water level gradually increases with increasing lead time. This is because the roughness value changes greatly in response to unsteady water flow, and the incurring error accumulates with the predicted period. The results show that the assimilation model can simulate water level changes in the micro-model and provide both research method and technical support for real flood forecasting in the LYR.","[Chen, Minghong; Pang, Juanjuan; Wu, Pengxiang] China Agr Univ, Coll Water Resources & Civil Engn, Beijing 100083, Peoples R China",,"Chen, MH (corresponding author), China Agr Univ, Coll Water Resources & Civil Engn, Beijing 100083, Peoples R China.",chenminghong@cau.edu.cn; 18801061663@163.com; 18800101270@163.com,,"Chen, Minghong/0000-0001-8991-8384","National Key Research and Development Program [2016YFC0400107, 2016YFC0402506]",This research was made possible with the support of the National Key Research and Development Program (Grant Number: 2016YFC0400107 and 2016YFC0402506).,,26,7,8,1,9,MDPI,BASEL,"ST ALBAN-ANLAGE 66, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND",2073-4441,,,WATER-SUI,Water,NOV,2018,10,11,,,,,,,1612,10.3390/w10111612,,,15,Environmental Sciences; Water Resources,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),Environmental Sciences & Ecology; Water Resources,HC3XM,WOS:000451736300119,,"Green Submitted, gold",,,2022-02-17

Models were implemented, trained, and tested over an observation period and forecasting groundwater depth at short-term over a period 2017-2030. Results show that groundwater abstraction rates increase around 0.46Mm(3)/year, whereas a groundwater depth is in continuously drawdown with a rate of 0.3m/year which requires a monitoring network for sustainable management of water resources.

Future prediction of water quality parameters is necessary for the planning of water quality management. Sodium adsorption rate (SAR) is a parameter, which has a significant role in irrigation. In the present study, we compared the forecasting of SAR of water in Aras, Sepidrud, Karun, and Mond Rivers, Iran, using autoregressive integrated moving average (ARIMA) time series and radial basis functions (RBF) neural network. We found ARIMA (0,1,1) x (0,1,1)12, ARIMA (0,1,1) (0,1,1)12, ARIMA (0,1,1), and ARIMA ( 0,1,2) x (1,1,1)12 with minimum Akaike's Information Criterion (AIC) of -1.7127, - 1.8177, 2.9317, and 12.44 for SAR prediction of Aras, Sepidrud, Karun, and Mond Rivers, respectively. The residual of the mentioned ARIMA models was independent (p-value > 0.05). Using RBF neural network for SAR forecasting of Aras, Sepidrud, Karun, and Mond Rivers with normalized data, we obtained proper training and testing. Mean squared error (MSE are between 0.00026 and 0.0255) and mean bias error ( MBE are between 0.01566 and 0.0612) for training is very low.

Thirty-six months RBF neural network and 12 months of ARIMA time series of SAR forecasting for Aras River comparatively match to the measured data and forecast error of both RBF and ARIMA were comparable.

To this end, the present research starts with this method and, based on a support vector machine (SVM), it introduces ant colony optimization (ACO) to optimize its penalty coefficient C, Kernel function parameter g, and insensitivity coefficient p, to construct a data-driven ACO-SVM model. The validity of the method is confirmed by taking the Minjiang River Basin as an example.

We hypothesized that river discharge in large river basins is directly related to upstream water conditions that lead to generation of high and low flows. Using the Ganges-Brahmaputra-Meghna Rivers as an example and Bayesian regressive models, we showed that terrestrial water storage (TWS) anomalies from the Gravity Recovery and Climate Experiment (GRACE) can provide reliable estimates of flows, which are essential hydroclimatic variables for predicting endemic cholera, with an overall accuracy of 70% and up to 60 days in advance, without ancillary ground-based data.","[Khan, Rakibul; Usmani, Moiz; Jutla, Antarpreet] West Virginia Univ, Dept Civil & Environm Engn, Morgantown, WV 26505 USA; [Akanda, Ali] Univ Rhode Isl, Dept Civil & Environm Engn, Kingston, RI 02881 USA; [Palash, Wahid] Inst Water Modelling, Dhaka, Bangladesh; [Gao, Yongxuan] Calif State Water Resources Control Board, Div Water Rights, 1001 1 St, Sacramento, CA 95814 USA; [Huq, Anwar] Univ Maryland, Maryland Pathogen Res Inst, College Pk, MD 20740 USA; [Colwell, Rita] Univ Maryland, Maryland Pathogen Res Inst, Ctr Bioinformat & Computat Biol, College Pk, MD 20740 USA",,"Jutla, A (corresponding author), West Virginia Univ, Dept Civil & Environm Engn, Morgantown, WV 26505 USA.",asjutla@mail.wvu.edu,,"Jutla, Antarpreet/0000-0002-8191-2348; usmani, moiz/0000-0002-2718-8387",NASANational Aeronautics & Space Administration (NASA) [80NSSC18K0324],This research is in part funded by a project from NASA (Grant No. 80NSSC18K0324).,,37,3,3,0,11,ASCE-AMER SOC CIVIL ENGINEERS,RESTON,"1801 ALEXANDER BELL DR, RESTON, VA 20191-4400 USA",0733-9496,1943-5452,,J WATER RES PLAN MAN,J.

Flooding leads to severe civic and financial damage, particularly in large river basins, and mainly affects the downstream regions of a river bed. Artificial Intelligence (Al) models have been effectively utilized as a tool for modelling numerous nonlinear relationships and is suitable to model complex hydrological systems. Therefore, the main purpose of this research is to propose an effective hybrid system by integrating an Adaptive Neuro-Fuzzy Inference System (ANFIS) model with meta-heuristic Grey Wolf Optimization (GWO) and Grasshopper Optimization Algorithm (GOA) for flood prediction in River Mahanadi, India. Robustness of proposed meta-heurestics are assessed by comparing with a conventional ANFIS model focusing on various input combinations considering 50 years of monthly historical flood discharge data. The potential of the Al models is evaluated and compared with observed data in both training and validation sets based on three statistical performance evaluation factors, namely root mean squared error (RMSE), mean squared error (MSE) and Wilmott Index (WI).

In 2011, the mountainous region of Rio de Janeiro state suffered one of the largest natural hazards in Brazil, affecting more than 300,000 people, leaving more than 900 dead. This article simulates this natural hazard through Quantitative Precipitation Forecasting (QPF) and streamflow forecast ensemble, using 18 combinations of parameterizations between cumulus, microphysics, surface layer, planetary boundary layer, land surface and lateral contour conditions of the Weather Research and Forecasting (WRF) Model, coupling to the Soil Moisture Accounting Procedure (SMAP) hydrological model, seeking to find the best set of parametrizations for the forecasting of extreme events in the region. The results showed rainfall and streamflow forecast were underestimated by the models, reaching an error of 57.4% to QPF and 24.6% error to streamflow, and part of these errors are related to the lack of skill of the atmospheric model in predicting the intensity and the spatial-temporal distribution of rainfall. These results bring to light the limitations of numerical weather prediction, possibly due to the lack of initiatives involving the adaptation of empirical constants, intrinsic in the parametrization models, to the specific atmospheric conditions of each region of the country.","[da Cunha Luz Barcellos, Priscila; Cataldi, Marcio] Fed Fluminense Univ UFF, Postgrad Program Civil Engn Management Prod & Env, BR-24210240 Niteroi, RJ, Brazil",,"Barcellos, PDL (corresponding author), Fed Fluminense Univ UFF, Postgrad Program Civil Engn Management Prod & Env, BR-24210240 Niteroi, RJ, Brazil.",luz.priscila@gmail.com; marcio.cataldi@gmail.com,,,,,,57,5,5,2,9,MDPI,BASEL,"ST ALBAN-ANLAGE 66, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND",,2073-4433,,ATMOSPHERE-BASEL,Atmosphere,AUG,2020,11,8,,,,,,,834,10.3390/atmos11080834,,,24,Environmental Sciences; Meteorology & Atmospheric Sciences,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),Environmental Sciences & Ecology; Meteorology & Atmospheric Sciences,NH8JF,WOS:000564909200001,,gold,,,2022-02-17

Ice jams may occur during freeze-up and ice cover breakup phases, particularly in the middle and lower reaches of the river, with weirs and piers. The slush ice and ice blocks may accumulate to form ice jams, leading to backwater effects and substantial water level rise. The small bottom slope of the lower Oder and the tidal backflow from the Baltic Sea enhance the formation of ice jams during cold weather conditions, jeopardizing the dikes. Therefore, development of an ice jam flood forecasting system for the Oder River is much needed. This commentary presents selected results from an international workshop that took place in Wrocaw (Poland) on 26-27 November 2018 that brought together an international team of experts to explore the requirements and research opportunities in the field of ice jam flood forecasting and risk assessment for the Oder River section along the German-Polish border. The workshop launched a platform for collaboration amongst Canadian, German and Polish scientists, government officials and water managers to pave a way forward for joint research focused on achieving the long-term goal of forecasting, assessing and mitigating ice jam impacts along the lower Oder. German and Polish government agencies are in need of new tools to forecast ice jams and assess their subsequent consequences and risks to communities and ship navigation along a river. Addressing these issues will also help research and ice flood management in a Canadian context. A research program would aim to develop a modelling system by addressing fundamental issues that impede the prediction of ice jam events and their consequences in cold regions.","[Lindenschmidt, Karl-Erich] Univ Saskatchewan, Global Inst Water Secur, Saskatoon, SK S7N 3H5, Canada; [Carstensen, Dirk; Koegel, Michael] Tech Hsch Nurnberg, Inst Wasserbau & Wasserwirtsch, D-90489 Nurnberg, Germany; [Froehlich, Wolfgang; Roers, Michael] Landesamt Umwelt Brandenburg, D-15236 Frankfurt, Germany; [Hentschel, Bernd] Fed Waterways Engn & Res Inst BAW, D-76187 Karlsruhe, Germany; [Iwicki, Stefan; Lazarow, Adam] Reg Water Management Author, Dept Inland Waterways, PL-70001 Szczecin, Poland; [Kubicki, Michal; Weintrit, Beata] Astri Polska Sp Zoo, PL-02256 Warsaw, Poland; [Kundzewicz, Zbigniew W.] Polish Acad Sci, Inst Agr & Forest Environm, PL-60809 Poznan, Poland; [Lauschke, Cornelia] Wasser & Schifffahrtsverwaltung, D-16225 Eberswalde, Germany; [Los, Helena] Polish Acad Sci, Inst Agrophys, PL-20280 Lublin, Poland; [Marszelewski, Wlodzimierz; Nowak, Marcin; Pawlowski, Boguslaw] Nicolaus Copernicus Univ Torun, Dept Hydrol & Water Management, PL-87100 Torun, Poland; [Niedzielski, Tomasz] Univ Wroclaw, Dept Geoinformat & Cartog, PL-50137 Wroclaw, Poland; [Schlaffer, Stefan] German Aerosp Ctr DLR, D-82234 Wessling, Germany",,"Lindenschmidt, KE (corresponding author), Univ Saskatchewan, Global Inst Water Secur, Saskatoon, SK S7N 3H5, Canada.",karl-erich.lindenschmidt@usask.ca; dirk.carstensen@th-nuernberg.de; Wolfgang.Froehlich@LfU.Brandenburg.de; bemd.hentschel@baw.de; stefan.iwicki@szczecin.rzgw.gov.pl; michael.koegel@th-nuernberg.de; michal.kubicki@astripolska.pl; kundzewicz@yahoo.com; Cornelia.Lauschke@wsv.bund.de; adam.lazarow@rzgw.szczecin.pl; hlos@ipan.lublin.pl; marszel@umk.pl; tomasz.niedzielski@uwr.edu.pl; mnowak@umk.pl; bogus@umk.pl; Michael.Roers@LfU.Brandenburg.de; Stefan.Schlaffer@dlr.de; beata.weintrit@astripolska.pl,"Niedzielski, Tomasz/AAI-8985-2020; Pawłowski, Bogusław/ABC-3470-2021; Marszelewski, Wlodzimierz/D-4630-2014","Niedzielski, Tomasz/0000-0001-8236-9861; Pawłowski, Bogusław/0000-0002-0271-2779; Kogel, Michael/0000-0003-0629-3855; Schlaffer, Stefan/0000-0003-4742-8648; Nowak, Marcin/0000-0002-7819-1818; Lindenschmidt, Karl-Erich/0000-0001-6348-2295; Kundzewicz, Zbigniew/0000-0002-3579-5072","Global Water Futures program; National Science Centre of PolandNational Science Centre, Poland [2011/01/D/ST10/04171]; National Centre for Research and Development of PolandNational Centre for Research & Development, Poland [TANGO1/267857/NCBR/2015]","The Wroclaw workshop expenses were covered by funds from the Global Water Futures program and hosted by the Global Institute for Water Security, University of Saskatchewan.

Machine Learning-based models showed several drawbacks for frequent high and a wide range of streamflow records. These models also experience problems during the training process such as over-fitting or trapping in searching for global optima To overcome these limitations, the current study attempts to hybridize the recently developed physics-inspired metaheuristic algorithms (MHAs) such as Equilibrium Optimization (EO), Henry Gases Solubility Optimization (HGSO), and Nuclear Reaction Optimization(NRO) with Multi-layer Perceptron (MLP). These models' accuracy will be inspected to solve the streamflow forecasting problem where the streamflow dataset was collected through 130 years from a station located on the High Aswan Dam (HAD). The performance of proposed models then will be compared with two traditional neural network models(MLP and RNN), and nine well-known hybrid MLP-based models belong to the different branches of the metaheuristic field (evolutionary group, swarm group, and physics group). The internal parameters of the proposed models will be initialized and optimized. Different performance metrics will be used to examine the performance of the proposed models. The stability of the proposed models and the convergence speed will be evaluated. Finally, ranking these models based on different performance evaluations will be carried out. The results show that the models in the group of Physics-MLP are more reliable in capturing the streamflow patterns, followed by the Swarm-MLP group and then by the Evolutionary-MLP group. Finally, among the all employed methods, the NRO has the best accuracy with the lowest RMSE(2.35), MAE(1.356), MAPE(16.747), and the highest WI(0.957), R(0.924), and confidence in forecasting the streamflow of Aswan High Dam. It can be concluded that augmenting the NRO algorithm with MLP can be a reliable tool in forecasting the monthly streamflow with a high level of precision, speed convergence, and high constancy level.

The current study investigated the applicability of the artificial neural network (Ann), adaptive neuro-fuzzy inference system (Anfis), wavelet-Ann (Wann) and wavelet-Anfis (Wanfis) for daily river flow forecasting in Karaj River. Three scenarios were used. In the first scenario, meteorological data were used as input variables for model development. In the second, flow discharge data were used, while the third scenario used a combination of scenarios 1 and 2 as input variables for model development. For each scenario, different combinations of time series were considered. In the Wann and Wanfis models, the effective sub-time series components obtained by discrete wavelet transform were used as the new inputs to Ann and Anfis models to predict daily river flow time series. Wann was found to be the best technique for daily flow prediction throughout this study. The results indicate that the best Wann model (R-test(2) = 0.993, RMSEtest = 0.004) outperformed the best Wanfis model (R-test(2) = 0.976, RMSEtest = 0.008). The results show that only the input structures of scenarios 2 and 3 are efficient input structures for flow prediction in the study area. It was also shown that Wann models are capable of delivering an accurate flow prediction up to the next 4 d.","[Alizadeh, Mohamad Javad] KN Toosi Univ Technol, Fac Civil Engn, Tehran, Iran; [Rajaee, Taher] Univ Qom, Dept Civil Engn, Qom, Iran; [Motahari, Meysam] Imam Khomeini Int Univ, Dept Water Engn, Qazvin, Iran",,"Alizadeh, MJ (corresponding author), KN Toosi Univ Technol, Fac Civil Engn, Tehran, Iran.",mjalizadeh@mail.kntu.ac.ir,,"Rajaee, Taher/0000-0002-4325-2537",,,,42,3,3,0,16,ICE PUBLISHING,WESTMINISTER,"INST CIVIL ENGINEERS, 1 GREAT GEORGE ST, WESTMINISTER SW 1P 3AA, ENGLAND",1741-7589,,,P I CIVIL ENG-WAT M,Proc.

It will be a kind of flexible research method to realize the flood prediction of small and medium-sized rivers through intelligent models such as neural network. The area of small and medium-sized river basins is relatively small. Precipitation, soil moisture, evaporation and other factors can affect the timely total runoff prediction. However, not all the hydrological features is always valuable for flood forecasting, even at some time, noise of the factors will have larger interference on forecast process. Therefore, dynamic extraction of key feature vectors from various hydrological information plays an important role in flood forecasting. This paper proposed a flood forecasting model (STA-LSTM model) by using long short-term memory model (LSTM) and attention mechanism. We take the Lech river basin in Europe as the experimental basin and the results show that STA-LSTM performs well and has high research value with comparison of support vector machine (SVM),fully connected network (FCN) and original LSTM.","[Ding, Yukai; Zhu, Yuelong; Wu, Yirui; Feng, Jun] Hohai Univ, Coll Comp & Informat, Nanjing, Peoples R China; [Cheng, Zirun] Tongji Univ, Sch Foreign Languages, Shanghai, Peoples R China",,"Ding, YK (corresponding author), Hohai Univ, Coll Comp & Informat, Nanjing, Peoples R China.",dingyukai@hhu.edu.cn; ylzhu@hhu.edu.cn; wuyirui@hhu.edu.cn; fengjun@hhu.edu.cn; 1833052@tongji.edu.cn,,,National Key R&D Program of China [2018YFC0407901]; Natural Science Foundation of ChinaNational Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC) [61702160]; Science Foundation of Jiangsu [BK20170892]; open Project of the National Key Lab for Novel Software Technology in NJU [K-FKT2017B05],"This work was supported by National Key R&D Program of China under Grant 2018YFC0407901, the Natural Science Foundation of China under Grant Grant 61702160, the Science Foundation of Jiangsu under Grant BK20170892, and the open Project of the National Key Lab for Novel Software Technology in NJU under Grant K-FKT2017B05.",,27,8,8,4,10,IEEE,NEW YORK,"345 E 47TH ST, NEW YORK, NY 10017 USA",,,978-1-7281-2980-8,,,,2019,,,,,,,458,465,,10.1109/iThings/GreenCom/CPSCom/SmartData.2019.00095,,,8,"Computer Science, Theory & Methods; Green & Sustainable Science & Technology; Telecommunications",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S),Computer Science; Science & Technology - Other Topics; Telecommunications,BQ2KL,WOS:000579857700072,,,,,2022-02-17

In a context of integrated production system involving the reservoir, wells, and production facilities, the quality of production forecast depends not only on the quality of reservoir models and well productivity/injectivity but also on the boundary condition for the future extrapolation which, in turn, depends on the production system characteristics. Both systems, reservoir and production facilities, are characterized by uncertain properties and behavior, such as porosity and permeability, among others, for reservoir; pipeline roughness, multiphase flow behavior in pipes, among others, for the production system. This paper proposes a methodology for dynamic data assimilation to reduce uncertainty in both reservoir and production system models to improve short- and medium-term production forecast. The methodology was applied to a benchmark case built using real data from an offshore field in The Campos Basin (Brazil). The results from this study show that it is important to perform data assimilation process in both reservoir and production systems to obtain more reliable production forecasts. We also show that, by focusing on the short- and medium-term production forecast, the production system and reservoir uncertainties cause variability in the production forecast in the same order or magnitude. Based on that, it is recommended to consider multiple solutions of the production system to obtain more realistic production forecasts.","[Maschio, Celio; von Hohendorff Filho, Joao Carlos; Schiozer, Denis Jose] Univ Campinas Unicamp, Ctr Petr Studies CEPETRO, Campinas, SP, Brazil",,"Maschio, C (corresponding author), Univ Campinas Unicamp, Ctr Petr Studies CEPETRO, Campinas, SP, Brazil.",celio@cepetro.unicamp.br; hohendorff@cepetro.unicamp.br; denis@unicamp.br,,,PetrobrasFundacao de Amparo a Pesquisa do Amapa (FAPEAP)Petrobras [0050.0102146.16.9]; Energi Simulation within the ANP RD tax; Center of Petroleum Studies (CEPETRO-UNICAMP/Brazil); Department of Energy (DE-FEM-UNICAMP/Brazil)United States Department of Energy (DOE); Research Group in Reservoir Simulation and Management (UNISIM-UNICAMP/Brazil),"This work was conducted with the support of Petrobras (Grant Agreement No. 0050.0102146.16.9) and Energi Simulation within the ANP R&D tax as commitment to research and development in-vestments.

The k-nearest neighbor (kNN) algorithm is such a type of machine learning method, where no assumptions on the dataset distributions are made, but a minimal (no explicit) training stage is required. This is especially useful in river ice forecasting where weather and river condition indicators often do not obey the typical theoretical assumptions; the complex river ice mechanisms are difficult to directly quantify. However, few applications of kNN to river ice studies have been reported. Since the predictive performance of a single kNN is limited, we combine multiple KNN models (first-level) based on different numbers of inputs which are linearly or nonlinearly correlated to annual peak breakup flow (APBF); we use both simple average methods and kNN models as combining models (second-level), and we apply the kNN-based combination models to APBF forecasting of the Smoky River at Watino, Canada. The Mahalanobis distance is chosen in kNN since neither the standardization of input variables nor the assignments of weights to variables are required. The historical breakup data at this site for the past 33 years (1980 to 2012) were collected to facilitate the performance comparison of models. The results show that both training and validation performances of the combining models are substantially better than those of member models. The proposed framework can be potentially applied to various forecasting problems in water resources management practice.","[Sun, Wei; Trevor, Bernard] Alberta Environm & Pk, River Engn & Tech Serv Sect, Watershed Adaptat & Resilience Branch, River Forecast Ctr,Strategy Div, Edmonton, AB T5K 2J6, Canada",,"Sun, W (corresponding author), Alberta Environm & Pk, River Engn & Tech Serv Sect, Watershed Adaptat & Resilience Branch, River Forecast Ctr,Strategy Div, Edmonton, AB T5K 2J6, Canada.",Wei.Sun@gov.ab.ca,"Sun, Wei/K-9385-2017","Sun, Wei/0000-0003-3186-1156",Alberta Environment and Parks,"This study is financially supported by Alberta Environment and Parks.

Due to population growth, economic development and urbanization, the demand for water in these areas is increasing day by day and with all available resources, water management becomes more and more crucial. Therefore, rain probability analysis is needed to address a number of water management issues and to prevent crop damage due to deficits or excess rainfall. Scientific rainfall forecasting and crop planning can prove to be an important tool in the hands of farmers for better economic returns. An attempt was made to analyze the frequency of different rainfall data. Frequency analysis helps in determining the expected rainfall. An important step in analyzing the frequency of rainfall is selecting a suitable distribution to represent the depth of the rainfall to investigate the precipitation. The distributions namely, Gumbel, Log Normal, Log Pearson Type III and Van Te Chow were used for the prediction of the maximum annual rainfall. Annual rainfall data for 20 years (1991-2010) were collected from the National Institute of Hydrology (NIH), Roorkee, India. This research attempts to fit several theoretical probability distributions to the maximum annual rainfall for daily, two consecutive days, three consecutive days; and to select the best probability distribution for the prediction of maximum annual rainfall for daily, two consecutive days, three consecutive days.For determination of goodness of fit chi-square, percentage absolute deviation, integral square errorwere carried out by comparing the expected values with the observed values. The results found showed that the Gumbel distribution emerged to be the best fit for the prediction of annual maximum rainfall values of Roorkee for one, two and three consecutive days.

While the skill of such forecasts has been verified for several atmospheric variables, land hydrological states such as terrestrial water storage (TWS) have not been extensively investigated yet due to a lack of long observational records. Anomalies of TWS are globally observed with the satellite missions GRACE(2002-2017) and GRACE-FO(since 2018). By means of a GRACE-like reconstruction of TWS available over 41 years, we demonstrate that this data type can be used to evaluate the skill of decadal prediction experiments made available from different Earth system models as part of both CMIP5 and CMIP6. Analysis of correlation and root-mean-square deviation (RMSD) reveals that for the global land average the initialized simulations outperform the historical experiments in the first three forecast years. This predominance originates mainly from equatorial regions where we assume a longer influence of initialization due to longer soil memory times. Evaluated for individual grid cells, the initialization has a largely positive effect on the forecast year 1 TWS states; however, a general grid-scale prediction skill for TWS of more than 2 years could not be identified in this study for CMIP5. First results from decadal hindcasts of three CMIP6 models indicate a predictive skill comparable to CMIP5 for the multimodel mean in general, and a distinct positive influence of the improved soil-hydrology scheme implemented in the MPI-ESM for CMIP6 in particular.","[Jensen, Laura; Eicker, Annette] HafenCity Univ, Geodesy & Geoinformat, Hamburg, Germany; [Stacke, Tobias] Helmholtz Zentrum Geesthacht, Ctr Mat & Coastal Res, Geesthacht, Germany; [Dobslaw, Henryk] Helmholtz Ctr Potsdam, German Res Ctr Geosci GFZ, Potsdam, Germany",,"Jensen, L (corresponding author), HafenCity Univ, Geodesy & Geoinformat, Hamburg, Germany.",laura.jensen@hcu-hamburg.de,"Eicker, Annette/B-6076-2014","Eicker, Annette/0000-0002-9087-1445; Stacke, Tobias/0000-0003-4637-5337",,,,48,0,0,4,9,AMER METEOROLOGICAL SOC,BOSTON,"45 BEACON ST, BOSTON, MA 02108-3693 USA",0894-8755,1520-0442,,J CLIMATE,J.

These floods were driven by repeated heavy rainfall events in the lower Paraguay River basin. Alternating sequences of enhanced moisture inflow from the South American low-level jet and local convergence associated with baroclinic systems were conducive to mesoscale convective activity and enhanced precipitation. These circulation patterns were favored by cross-time-scale interactions of a very strong El Nino event, an unusually persistent Madden-Julian oscillation in phases 4 and 5, and the presence of a dipole SST anomaly in the central southern Atlantic Ocean. The simultaneous use of seasonal and subseasonal heavy rainfall predictions could have provided decision-makers with useful information about the start of these flooding events from two to four weeks in advance. Probabilistic seasonal forecasts available at the beginning of November successfully indicated heightened probability of heavy rainfall (90th percentile) over southern Paraguay and Brazil for December-February. Raw subseasonal forecasts of heavy rainfall exhibited limited skill at lead times beyond the first two predicted weeks, but a model output statistics approach involving principal component regression substantially improved the spatial distribution of skill for week 3 relative to other methods tested, including extended logistic regressions. A continuous monitoring of climate drivers impacting rainfall in the region, and the use of statistically corrected heavy precipitation seasonal and subseasonal forecasts, may help improve flood preparedness in this and other regions.","[Doss-Gollin, James] Columbia Univ, Columbia Water Ctr, New York, NY 10027 USA; [Doss-Gollin, James] Columbia Univ, Dept Earth & Environm Engn, New York, NY 10027 USA; [Munoz, Angel G.] Princeton Univ, Atmospher & Ocean Sci, Princeton, NJ 08544 USA; [Munoz, Angel G.; Mason, Simon J.] Columbia Univ, Earth Inst, Int Res Inst Climate & Soc, Palisades, NY USA; [Pasten, Max] Direcc Meteorol & Hidrol, Asuncion, Paraguay; [Pasten, Max] Univ Nacl Asuncion, Fac Politecn, San Lorenzo, Paraguay",,"Doss-Gollin, J (corresponding author), Columbia Univ, Columbia Water Ctr, New York, NY 10027 USA.; Doss-Gollin, J (corresponding author), Columbia Univ, Dept Earth & Environm Engn, New York, NY 10027 USA.",james.doss-gollin@columbia.edu,"Doss-Gollin, James/J-4273-2014; Mason, Simon/AAH-5699-2020","Doss-Gollin, James/0000-0002-3428-2224; ","NSF GRFP programNational Science Foundation (NSF)NSF - Office of the Director (OD) [DGE 16-44869]; National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, U.S. Department of CommerceNational Oceanic Atmospheric Admin (NOAA) - USA [NA14OAR4320106]","The authors thankDavid Farnham, Upmanu Lall, Laureline Josset, and Andrew Robertson for insightful conversations and guidance.

However, global seasonal forecasts are usually not directly applicable as they are provided at coarse spatial resolutions of at best 36 km and suffer from model biases and drifts. In this study, we therefore apply a bias-correction and spatial-disaggregation (BCSD) approach to seasonal precipitation, temperature and radiation forecasts of the latest long-range seasonal forecasting system SEAS5 of the European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts (ECMWF). As reference we use data from the ERA5-Land offline land surface rerun of the latest ECMWF reanalysis ERA5. Thereby, we correct for model biases and drifts and improve the spatial resolution from 36 km to 0.1 degrees. This is performed for example over four predominately semi-arid study domains across the world, which include the river basins of the Karun (Iran), the Sao Francisco River (Brazil), the Tekeze-Atbara river and Blue Nile (Sudan, Ethiopia and Eritrea), and the Catamayo-Chira river (Ecuador and Peru). Compared against ERA5-Land, the bias-corrected and spatially dis-aggregated forecasts have a higher spatial resolution and show reduced biases and better agreement of spatial patterns than the raw forecasts as well as remarkably reduced lead-dependent drift effects. But our analysis also shows that computing monthly averages from daily bias-corrected forecasts particularly during periods with strong temporal climate gradients or heteroscedasticity can lead to remaining biases especially in the lowest- and highest-lead forecasts. Our SEAS5 BCSD forecasts cover the whole (re-)forecast period from 1981 to 2019 and include bias-corrected and spatially disaggregated daily and monthly ensemble forecasts for precipitation, average, minimum, and maximum temperature as well as for shortwave radiation from the issue date to the next 215 d and 6 months, respectively. This sums up to more than 100 000 forecasted days for each of the 25 (until the year 2016) and 51 (from the year 2017) ensemble members and each of the five analyzed variables.

It is currently the first publicly available daily high-resolution seasonal forecast product that covers multiple regions and variables for such a long period. It hence provides a unique test bed for evaluating the performance of seasonal forecasts over semi-arid regions and as driving data for hydrological, ecosystem or climate impact models. Therefore, our forecasts provide a crucial contribution for the disaster preparedness and, finally, climate proofing of the regional water management in climatically sensitive regions.","[Lorenz, Christof; Portele, Tanja C.; Laux, Patrick; Kunstmann, Harald] Karlsruhe Inst Technol KIT, Inst Meteorol & Climate Res Atmospher Environm Re, Campus Alpin,Kreuzeckbahnstr 19, D-82467 Garmisch Partenkirchen, Germany; [Laux, Patrick; Kunstmann, Harald] Augsburg Univ, Inst Geog, Alter Postweg 118, D-86159 Augsburg, Germany",,"Lorenz, C (corresponding author), Karlsruhe Inst Technol KIT, Inst Meteorol & Climate Res Atmospher Environm Re, Campus Alpin,Kreuzeckbahnstr 19, D-82467 Garmisch Partenkirchen, Germany.",christof.lorenz@kit.edu,"Laux, Patrick/A-7671-2013; Kunstmann, Harald/A-7071-2013","Laux, Patrick/0000-0002-8657-6152; Kunstmann, Harald/0000-0001-9573-1743; Lorenz, Christof/0000-0001-5590-5470",German Federal Ministry of Education and Research (BMBF)Federal Ministry of Education & Research (BMBF),"The authors would like to thank the German Federal Ministry of Education and Research (BMBF) for funding this research within the Seasonal Water Resources Management: Regionalized Global Data and Transfer to Practise (SaWaM, http://grow-sawam.org, last access: 2 June 2021) project.

In this paper, these forecasts and their skills are evaluated through relevant criteria, particularly by considering forecast performances for different lead times. Furthermore, to enhance their performance, we propose to preprocess the EPS forecasts' output using bias correction methods. For this aim, forecasts for different ranges of precipitation as well as various climatic conditions are evaluated, which is particularly important for extreme events that can lead to flooding. The Karun River basin in Iran is used as case study, a large area including various climate conditions. The results showed that the performance of European Center for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts (ECMWF) forecasts vary with sub-basin properties, e.g., area and skewness of daily precipitation, and vary across dry to humid regions, between flooding and non-flooding seasons, and different lead times and show the effect of different methods for bias correction on the forecast skill. The forecast skill is decreasing from wet regions towards dry regions and the bias correction was more effective in the flooding season, for which the skill was increased by 40% based on continuous ranked probability skill score (CRPSS). When the precipitation thresholds were increased towards extreme values, the forecast performance of ECMWF became better.","[Abedi, Mozhgan; Shafizadeh-Moghadam, Hossein; Morid, Saeed; Delavar, Majid] Tarbiat Modares Univ, Dept Water Resources Engn, POB 14115-336, Tehran, Iran; [Booij, Martijn J.] Univ Twente, Fac Engn Technol, Water Engn & Management, Enschede, Netherlands",,"Shafizadeh-Moghadam, H (corresponding author), Tarbiat Modares Univ, Dept Water Resources Engn, POB 14115-336, Tehran, Iran.",mojgan.abedi@modares.ac.ir; h.shafizadeh@modares.ac.ir; morid_sa@modares.ac.ir; m.j.booij@utwente.nl; m.delavar@modares.ac.ir,"Booij, Martijn J./C-7753-2011","Booij, Martijn J./0000-0001-6208-9045",,,,23,1,1,0,2,SPRINGER WIEN,WIEN,"SACHSENPLATZ 4-6, PO BOX 89, A-1201 WIEN, AUSTRIA",0177-798X,1434-4483,,THEOR APPL CLIMATOL,Theor.

In accordance with the advancement of computer aids in this field, various machine learning (ML) models have been explored to solve this highly non-stationary, stochastic, and nonlinear problem. In the current research, a newly explored version of an ML model called the long short-term memory (LSTM) was investigated for streamflow prediction using historical data for forecasting for a particular period. For a case study located in a tropical environment, the Kelantan river in the northeast region of the Malaysia Peninsula was selected. The modelling was performed according to several perspectives: (i) The feasibility of applying the developed LSTM model to streamflow prediction was verified, and the performance of the developed LSTM model was compared with the classic backpropagation neural network model; (ii) In the experimental process of applying the LSTM model to the prediction of streamflow, the influence of the training set size on the performance of the developed LSTM model was tested; (iii) The effect of the time interval between the training set and the testing set on the performance of the developed LSTM model was tested; (iv) The effect of the time span of the prediction data on the performance of the developed LSTM model was tested. The experimental data show that not only does the developed LSTM model have obvious advantages in processing steady streamflow data in the dry season but it also shows good ability to capture data features in the rapidly fluctuant streamflow data in the rainy season.","[Fu, Minglei; Fan, Tingchao; Ding, Zi'ang] Zhejiang Univ Technol, Coll Informat Engn, Hangzhou 310023, Peoples R China; [Salih, Sinan Q.] Duy Tan Univ, Inst Res & Dev, Da Nang 550000, Vietnam; [Al-Ansari, Nadhir] Lulea Univ Technol, Civil Environm & Nat Resources Engn, S-97187 Lulea, Sweden; [Yaseen, Zaher Mundher] Ton Duc Thang Univ, Sustainable Dev Civil Engn Res Grp, Fac Civil Engn, Ho Chi Minh City, Vietnam",,"Yaseen, ZM (corresponding author), Ton Duc Thang Univ, Sustainable Dev Civil Engn Res Grp, Fac Civil Engn, Ho Chi Minh City, Vietnam.",yaseen@tdtu.edu.vn,"Salih, Sinan/F-6284-2019; Yaseen, Zaher Mundher/G-7029-2018","Salih, Sinan/0000-0003-0717-7506; Yaseen, Zaher Mundher/0000-0003-3647-7137; Al-Ansari, Nadhir/0000-0002-6790-2653; Fan, Tingchao/0000-0001-6515-0788; ziang, ding/0000-0002-5313-2686",,,,50,35,35,10,29,IEEE-INST ELECTRICAL ELECTRONICS ENGINEERS INC,PISCATAWAY,"445 HOES LANE, PISCATAWAY, NJ 08855-4141 USA",2169-3536,,,IEEE ACCESS,IEEE Access,,2020,8,,,,,,32632,32651,,10.1109/ACCESS.2020.2974406,,,20,"Computer Science, Information Systems; Engineering, Electrical & Electronic; Telecommunications",Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),Computer Science; Engineering; Telecommunications,LC6CZ,WOS:000525419700010,,gold,,,2022-02-17

Fiji, in particular, is often exposed to extreme rainfall events and associated flooding, with significant impacts on properties, infrastructure, agriculture, and the tourism sector. While these occurrences are often associated with tropical cyclones (TCs), the specific characteristics of TCs that produce extreme rainfall are not well understood. In particular, TC intensity does not appear to be a useful guide in predicting rainfall, since weaker TCs are capable of producing large rainfall compared to more intense systems. Therefore, other TC characteristics, in particular TC track morphology and background climate conditions, may provide more useful insights into what drives TC related extreme rainfall. This study aimed to address this problem by developing a decision tree to identify the most important predictors of TC related extreme rainfall (i.e., 95th percentile) for Fiji. TC attributes considered include; TC duration, the average moving speed of TCs, the minimum distance of TCs from land, seasonality, intensity (wind speed) and the geometry of TCs (i.e., geographical location, shape and length via cluster and sinuosity analyses of TC tracks). In addition, potential predictors based on the phases of Indo-Pacific climate modes were input to the decision tree to represent large scale background conditions. It was found that a TC's minimum distance from land was the most important influence on extreme rainfall, followed by TC cluster grouping, seasonality and duration. The application of this model could result in improved TC risk evaluations and could be used by forecasters and decision-makers on mitigating TC impacts over the Fiji Islands.","[Sharma, Krishneel K.; Verdon-Kidd, Danielle C.] Univ Newcastle, Coll Engn Sci & Environm, Sch Environm & Life Sci, Callaghan, NSW 2308, Australia; [Magee, Andrew D.] Univ Newcastle, Coll Engn Sci & Environm, Ctr Water Climate & Land CWCL, Callaghan, NSW 2308, Australia",,"Sharma, KK (corresponding author), Univ Newcastle, GG03,Earth Sci Bldg,Univ Dr, Callaghan, NSW 2308, Australia.",Krishneel.Sharma@uon.edu.au,"Sharma, Krishneel Kumar/AAA-7057-2022","Sharma, Krishneel Kumar/0000-0001-6802-2239",University of Newcastle (UoN); International Postgraduate Research Scholarship (UNIPRS) and Research Scholarship Central [UNRSC50:50]; Research Higher Degree (RHD) program at UoN,"Krishneel K.

The neural network model FFNN in the form of architecture I(8)-HL(9)-O(1) has been successfully developed to classify the water quality of the Dong Nai river during the period from 2012 to 2019. For this model, the RMSE values for the training, validation, and test sets are equal to 0.0392, 0.0411, and 0.0423, respectively. Also, the MAPE values for those data sets are 1.241, 1.444, and 1.511, respectively. The models ARIMA(0,1,3)(1,1,1), NAR, NAR-MA, LSTM, and LSTM-MA were used to forecast the water quality according to different time series (months) k = 12 and k = 24 at the monitoring points. The LSTM-MA hybrid model provided faster training time and more reliable forecasts than the ARIMA, NAR, NAR-MA, and LSTM models. The RMSE and MAPE values of the LSTM-MA hybrid model for predicting the forecast set are smaller than those from other models. The LSTM-MA hybrid model was used to classify the water quality over the years 2020 to 2022. The water quality classification derived from the LSTM-MA hybrid model in close agreement with the actual monitoring data.

Recent research in snow-dominated catchments showed that forecasts can be further enhanced by also including soil moisture measurements, but the impact of soil moisture data on forecast performance in rainfall-dominated watersheds remains unknown. Our objective was to evaluate the potential improvements gained by including in-situ soil moisture data in seasonal streamflow forecasting models in rainfall-dominated watersheds. Precipitation and soil moisture data from four watersheds in the U.S. were incorporated into a modified principal components analysis and regression method to predict seasonal (4-month) streamflow totals at 0-, 1-, 2-, and 3-month lead times. Forecasts derived from antecedent precipitation alone were often statistically insignificant and explained less than 30% of the variance in seasonal streamflow, as indicated by the Nash-Sutcliffe efficiency coefficient. Conversely, forecast models that included soil moisture information explained up to 87% of seasonal streamflow variance at the 0-month lead time, up to 81% at the 1-month lead time, up to 71% at the 2-month lead time, and up to 52% at the 3-month lead time. The root mean square errors for forecasts which included soil moisture data were on average 55% lower than for those based on antecedent precipitation alone. The soil moisture-based forecasts for rainfall-dominated watersheds exhibited accuracies comparable to those previously reported in snow-dominated watersheds. This new forecast method shows strong potential for use in surface water management in rainfall-dominated regions.","[Wyatt, Briana M.; Ochsner, Tyson E.; Krueger, Erik S.] Oklahoma State Univ, Dept Plant & Soil Sci, Stillwater, OK 74078 USA; [Jones, Eric T.] Natl Weather Serv Arkansas Red River Forecast Ctr, Tulsa, OK USA",,"Ochsner, TE (corresponding author), Oklahoma State Univ, Dept Plant & Soil Sci, Stillwater, OK 74078 USA.",tyson.ochsner@okstate.edu,,"Wyatt, Briana M./0000-0002-3393-1157; Ochsner, Tyson/0000-0003-0875-4491",USGS 104(b) program; Oklahoma Water Resources Center Berry Fellows Program; USDA National Institute of Food and AgricultureUnited States Department of Agriculture (USDA) [OKL02918]; Division of Agricultural Sciences and Natural Resources at Oklahoma State University,"Support for this work was provided by the USGS 104(b) program and the Oklahoma Water Resources Center Berry Fellows Program.

To overcome this challenge, the Climate Forecast System Reanalysis (CFSR) global weather data was evaluated and compared with the limited conventional weather data available in the Upper Awash Basin. The main objective of this study was to search for an optional data source for hydrological modeling, instead of using the limited available data, and for data-scarce areas of the basin. The Soil and Water Assessment Tool model was used to compare the performance of the two weather datasets at simulating monthly streamflow. For calibration, validation, and uncertainty analysis, the sequential uncertainty fitting algorithm was used. The model evaluation statistics showed that the CFSR global weather data performed similarly to the conventional weather data for simulating the observed streamflow at Melka Kunture. At Keleta, where the conventional data is scarce, the CFSR performed better. The CFSR performance at the two sub-basins indicated that it performed better for the large sub-basin, Melka Kunture. Generally, the CFSR weather data are a good addition to the dataset for areas where no reliable weather data exists for hydrological modeling in the basin. The precipitation data of the CFSR are slightly higher than that of the conventional data, which also resulted in a relatively higher water balance components.","[Tolera, Mesfin Benti; Chung, Il-Moon; Chang, Sun Woo] UST, Smart City & Construct Engn Dept, Daejeon 34113, South Korea; [Tolera, Mesfin Benti; Chung, Il-Moon; Chang, Sun Woo] Korea Inst Civil Engn & Bldg Technol KICT, Dept Land Water & Environm Res, Goyang 10223, South Korea",,"Chung, IM (corresponding author), UST, Smart City & Construct Engn Dept, Daejeon 34113, South Korea.; Chung, IM (corresponding author), Korea Inst Civil Engn & Bldg Technol KICT, Dept Land Water & Environm Res, Goyang 10223, South Korea.",mesfinbenti@kict.re.kr; imchung@kict.re.kr; chang@kict.re.kr,"Chang, Sun Woo/AAO-5551-2020",,"Ministry of Land, Infrastructure, and Transport of Korean government [18RDRP-B076272-05]","This work was supported by a grant (18RDRP-B076272-05) from Infrastructure and transportation technology promotion research program funded by the Ministry of Land, Infrastructure, and Transport of Korean government.",,38,21,21,0,4,MDPI,BASEL,"ST ALBAN-ANLAGE 66, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND",,2073-4441,,WATER-SUI,Water,JUN,2018,10,6,,,,,,,725,10.3390/w10060725,,,17,Environmental Sciences; Water Resources,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),Environmental Sciences & Ecology; Water Resources,GK8XL,WOS:000436515100056,,"Green Submitted, gold",,,2022-02-17

Statistical streamflow post-processing is an important technique available to improve the probabilistic properties of the forecasts. This study evaluates post-processing approaches based on three transformations - logarithmic (Log), log-sinh (Log-Sinh), and Box-Cox with lambda = 0.2 (BC0.2) - and identifies the best-performing scheme for post-processing monthly and seasonal (3-months-ahead) streamflow forecasts, such as those produced by the Australian Bureau of Meteorology. Using the Bureau's operational dynamic streamflow forecasting system, we carry out comprehensive analysis of the three post-processing schemes across 300 Australian catchments with a wide range of hydro-climatic conditions. Forecast verification is assessed using reliability and sharpness metrics, as well as the Continuous Ranked Probability Skill Score (CRPSS). Results show that the uncorrected forecasts (i. e. without post-processing) are unreliable at half of the catchments. Post-processing of forecasts substantially improves reliability, with more than 90% of forecasts classified as reliable. In terms of sharpness, the BC0.2 scheme substantially outperforms the Log and Log-Sinh schemes. Overall, the BC0.2 scheme achieves reliable and sharper-than-climatology forecasts at a larger number of catchments than the Log and Log-Sinh schemes. The improvements in forecast reliability and sharpness achieved using the BC0.2 post-processing scheme will help water managers and users of the forecasting service make better-informed decisions in planning and management of water resources.","[Woldemeskel, Fitsum; Shin, Daehyok] Bur Meteorol, Melbourne, Vic, Australia; [McInerney, David; Thyer, Mark; Kavetski, Dmitri] Univ Adelaide, Sch Civil Environm & Min Engn, Adelaide, SA, Australia; [Lerat, Julien; Tuteja, Narendra] Bur Meteorol, Canberra, ACT, Australia; [Kavetski, Dmitri; Kuczera, George] Univ Newcastle, Sch Engn, Callaghan, NSW, Australia",,"Woldemeskel, F (corresponding author), Bur Meteorol, Melbourne, Vic, Australia.",fitsum.woldemeskel@bom.gov.au,"McInerney, David J/I-4896-2015; Thyer, Mark A/A-9630-2011","McInerney, David J/0000-0003-4876-8281; Thyer, Mark A/0000-0002-2830-516X",Australian Research CouncilAustralian Research Council [LP140100978]; Australian Bureau of Meteorology; South East Queensland Water,Data for this study are provided by the Australian Bureau of Meteorology.

Results indicate that the simulated global irrigation and groundwater withdrawals (circa 2000) are similar to 3600 and similar to 370 km(3)/year, respectively, which are in good agreement with previous estimates from country statistics and offline-LSMs. Subseasonal predictions for boreal summers during the 1986-1995 period suggest that the spread among ensemble simulations of air temperature can be substantially reduced by using realistic land initializations considering irrigation-induced changes in soil moisture. Additionally, it is found that the subseasonal forecast skill for near-surface temperature and sea level pressure significantly improves when human-induced land disturbance is accounted for in the AGCM. These results underscore the need to incorporate irrigation into weather forecast models, such as the global forecast system.","[Yamada, Tomohito J.] Hokkaido Univ, Fac Engn, Kita Ku, N13 W8, Sapporo, Hokkaido 0608628, Japan; [Pokhrel, Yadu] Michigan State Univ, Dept Civil & Environm Engn, E Lansing, MI 48824 USA",,"Yamada, TJ (corresponding author), Hokkaido Univ, Fac Engn, Kita Ku, N13 W8, Sapporo, Hokkaido 0608628, Japan.",tomohito@eng.hokudai.ac.jp; ypokhrel@egr.msu.edu,"Pokhrel, Yadu/AAC-1776-2021; Pokhrel, Yadu/J-6440-2013","Pokhrel, Yadu/0000-0002-1367-216X","MEXT/SI-CAT; ADAP-T(SATREPS)/JICA-JST; National Science Foundation of the USNational Science Foundation (NSF) [1752729]; KAKENHIMinistry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology, Japan (MEXT)Japan Society for the Promotion of ScienceGrants-in-Aid for Scientific Research (KAKENHI) [19H02241]; ArCS","This study was partially supported by MEXT/SI-CAT, ADAP-T(SATREPS)/JICA-JST, ArCS, KAKENHI (19H02241), and a research grant (Award #1752729) from the National Science Foundation of the US.",,58,2,2,1,3,MDPI,BASEL,"ST ALBAN-ANLAGE 66, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND",,2073-4433,,ATMOSPHERE-BASEL,Atmosphere,NOV,2019,10,11,,,,,,,725,10.3390/atmos10110725,,,13,Environmental Sciences; Meteorology & Atmospheric Sciences,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),Environmental Sciences & Ecology; Meteorology & Atmospheric Sciences,JV3NC,WOS:000502272000087,,gold,,,2022-02-17

Forecast-based early action (FbA) is an approach to shift disaster response toward anticipation to mitigate impacts to at-risk communities; however, timely and accurate information is needed in the development of data-based triggers and thresholds for action. Therefore, this paper considers the readiness of a wide range of EO for flood monitoring and forecasting in the design, operations, and evaluation phases of FbA. The most significant opportunities for EO to inform FbA efforts lie in the design and evaluation phases, as EO can aid in the development of impact-based triggers. The EO products most readily applicable include precipitation, streamflow estimates, and exposure mapping, and those requiring the greatest amount of further research include vulnerability and impact assessments. This paper identifies collaboration opportunities for the EO and humanitarian communities to create tailored products, such as overlays combining flood extents with exposure maps. Such collaboration opportunities can be fostered by open data sharing, data verification efforts, and incentives for supporting boundary organizations capable of enabling the use of EO for FbA.

Because the virus is transmitted by mosquitoes, incidence is influenced by climate, environment, and socio-economic factors. Using epidemiological models to predict incidence or outbreaks of RRV fully utilises these data to inform decision-making. In this systematic review, we summarised models and their predictive performance, and highlighted significant exposures in order to increase understanding of transmission. Ross River virus (RRV) is the most common and widespread arbovirus in Australia. Epidemiological models of RRV increase understanding of RRV transmission and help provide early warning of outbreaks to reduce incidence. However, RRV predictive models have not been systematically reviewed, analysed, and compared. The hypothesis of this systematic review was that summarising the epidemiological models applied to predict RRV disease and analysing model performance could elucidate drivers of RRV incidence and transmission patterns. We performed a systematic literature search in PubMed, EMBASE, Web of Science, Cochrane Library, and Scopus for studies of RRV using population-based data, incorporating at least one epidemiological model and analysing the association between exposures and RRV disease. Forty-three articles, all of high or medium quality, were included. Twenty-two (51.2%) used generalised linear models and 11 (25.6%) used time-series models. Climate and weather data were used in 27 (62.8%) and mosquito abundance or related data were used in 14 (32.6%) articles as model covariates. A total of 140 models were included across the articles. Rainfall (69 models, 49.3%), temperature (66, 47.1%) and tide height (45, 32.1%) were the three most commonly used exposures. Ten (23.3%) studies published data related to model performance. This review summarises current knowledge of RRV modelling and reveals a research gap in comparing predictive methods. To improve predictive accuracy, new methods for forecasting, such as non-linear mixed models and machine learning approaches, warrant investigation.","[Qian, Wei; Harley, David] Univ Queensland MRI UQ, Mater Res Inst, Brisbane, Qld, Australia; [Viennet, Elvina] Australian Red Cross Lifeblood, Res & Dev, Brisbane, Qld, Australia; [Viennet, Elvina] Queensland Univ Technol QUT, Sch Biomed Sci, Inst Hlth & Biomed Innovat, Brisbane, Qld, Australia; [Glass, Kathryn] Australian Natl Univ, Res Sch Populat Hlth, Acton, ACT, Australia",,"Harley, D (corresponding author), Univ Queensland MRI UQ, Mater Res Inst, Brisbane, Qld, Australia.",d.harley@uq.edu.au,,"Wei, Qian/0000-0001-5753-7579; Glass, Kathryn/0000-0001-5905-1310",University of Queensland Research Training Scholarship; Frank Clair Scholarship; Australian governmentsAustralian Government,"This work is supported by the University of Queensland Research Training Scholarship and Frank Clair Scholarship.

The US Department of Agriculture Natural Resources Conservation Service (NRCS) operates the largest such system regionally. NRCS recently developed a next-generation WSF prototype, the multi-model machine-learning metasystem (M-4). Here, we test this ensemble artificial intelligence (AI)-based prototype against challenging theoretical and practical criteria for accepting a new operational WSF model. In 20 hindcasting test-cases spanning diverse environments across the western US and Alaska, on average out-of-sample R-2 and RPSS improved over 50% and RMSE improved 13% relative to current benchmarks. The M-4 ensemble mean forecast also performed more consistently than any of its diverse constituent models and in several cases outperformed all of them. Live operational testing at a subset of sites during the 2020 forecast season additionally demonstrated logistical feasibility of workflows, as well as geophysical explainability of results in terms of known hydrologic processes, belying the black-box reputation of machine learning and enabling relatable forecast storylines for clients. This was accomplished using WSF-focused pragmatic solutions, like popular votes for different candidate predictors among the constituent forecast systems, and graphical visualization of reduced-dimension, AI-extracted nonlinear feature-target relationships. We also found that certain M-4 technical design elements, including autonomous machine learning (AutoML), hyperparameter pre-calibration, and theory-guided data science, collectively permitted automated (over-the-loop) training and operation. Overall, the analyses confirmed M-4 meets requirements for NRCS operational adoption. This finding signals that, despite negligible operational-community uptake of machine learning so far, suitably purpose-designed novel AI systems have capacity to transition into large-scale practical applications with service-delivery organizations; it appears M-4 will be the largest AI migration into operational river forecasting to date. It may ultimately provide a broader integration platform for harnessing multiple data and model types.","[Fleming, Sean W.; Garen, David C.; Goodbody, Angus G.; McCarthy, Cara S.; Landers, Lexi C.] USDA, Natl Water & Climate Ctr, Nat Resources Conservat Serv, 1201 NE Lloyd Blvd,Suite 802, Portland, OR 97232 USA; [Fleming, Sean W.] Oregon State Univ, Coll Earth Ocean & Atmospher Sci, Corvallis, OR 97331 USA; [Fleming, Sean W.] Oregon State Univ, Water Resource Grad Program, Corvallis, OR 97331 USA; [Fleming, Sean W.] Univ British Columbia, Dept Earth Ocean & Atmospher Sci, Vancouver, BC, Canada",,"Fleming, SW (corresponding author), USDA, Natl Water & Climate Ctr, Nat Resources Conservat Serv, 1201 NE Lloyd Blvd,Suite 802, Portland, OR 97232 USA.",sean.fleming@usda.gov,,"Fleming, Sean William/0000-0002-0091-5302",,,,119,0,0,4,4,ELSEVIER,AMSTERDAM,"RADARWEG 29, 1043 NX AMSTERDAM, NETHERLANDS",0022-1694,1879-2707,,J HYDROL,J.

Forecasting yields of bioenergy crops at fine spatial resolutions can help to evaluate near-term and long-term pathways for scaling up bio-based fuel and chemical production, and for understanding the impacts of abiotic stressors such as severe droughts and temperature extremes on potential biomass supply. We used a large dataset of 28,364 Sorghum bicolor yield samples (uniquely identified by county and year of observation), environmental variables, and multiple approaches to analyze historical trends in sorghum productivity across the USA. We selected the most accurate machine learning approach (a variation of the random forest approach) to predict future trends in sorghum yields under four greenhouse gas (GHG) emission scenarios and two irrigation regimes. We identified irrigation practices, vapor pressure deficit, and time (a proxy for technological improvement) as the most important predictors of sorghum productivity. Our results showed a decreasing trend of sorghum yields over future years (on average 2.7% from 2018 to 2099), with greater decline under a high GHG emissions scenario (3.8%) and in the absence of irrigation (4.6%). Geographically, we observed the steepest predicted declines in the Great Lakes (8.2%), Upper Midwest (7.5%), and Heartland (6.7%) regions. Our study demonstrates the use of machine learning to identify environmental controllers of sorghum biomass yield and predict yields with reasonable accuracy. These results can inform the development of more realistic biomass supply projections for bioenergy if sorghum production is scaled up.

This study proposes a new hybrid approach that combines the Robust Local Mean Decomposition (RLMD) method and the Artificial Neural Network (ANN) method for the prediction of streamflow data. Monthly streamflow data were split into the training and the testing part firstly and threefold cross-validation was performed to obtain a more reliable model. After building of the model using the training data, the proposed model was tested on the testing data. Also to compare the performance of the RLMD-ANN model and the Support Vector Regression (SVR) model, Long Short-Term Memory Networks (LSTM) were used for forecasting of subband signal and streamflow data. Also, the hybrid Empirical Mode Decomposition (EMD) model and hybrid Autoregressive Integrated Moving Average (ARIMA) model were used for comparison of the proposed model. Therefore, the RLMD-ANN model was compared with RLMD-SVR, RLMD-LSTM, EMD-ANN, Additive-ARIMA-ANN, ANN, SVR, and LSTM models. The numerical results of the study were assessed concerning the Mean Square Error (MSE), Mean Absolute Error (MAE), Determination Coefficient (R-2), Correlation Coefficient (R), and Kruskal-Wallis test was used to indicate whether the results are statically significant. One- to three-ahead forecast and one-two inputs were applied to the models. The mean one-ahead forecasting performance of the three folds was calculated for two inputs with MSE, MAE, R-2, and R parameters as 0.0060, 0.0522, 0.7342, and 0.8532 respectively.

Near-real-time (NRT) discharge estimation is crucial to avoid the damages from flood disasters. The key input for the discharge estimation is precipitation. Directly using the ground stations to measure precipitation is not efficient, especially during a severe rainstorm, because precipitation varies even in the same region. This uncertainty might result in much less robust flood discharge estimation and forecasting models. The use of satellite precipitation products (SPPs) provides a larger area of coverage of rainstorms and a higher frequency of precipitation data compared to using the ground stations. In this paper, based on SPPs, a new NRT flood forecasting approach is proposed to reduce the time of the emergency response to flood disasters to minimize disaster damage. The proposed method allows us to forecast floods using a discharge hydrograph and to use the results to map flood extent by introducing SPPs into the rainfall-runoff model. In this study, we first evaluated the capacity of SPPs to estimate flood discharge and their accuracy in flood extent mapping. Two high temporal resolution SPPs were compared, integrated multi-satellite retrievals for global precipitation measurement (IMERG) and tropical rainfall measurement mission multi-satellite precipitation analysis (TMPA). The two products are evaluated over the Ottawa watershed in Canada during the period from 10 April 2017 to 10 May 2017. With TMPA, the results showed that the difference between the observed and modeled discharges was significant with a Nash-Sutcliffe efficiency (NSE) of -0.9241 and an adapted NSE (ANSE) of -1.0048 under high flow conditions. The TMPA-based model did not reproduce the shape of the observed hydrographs. However, with IMERG, the difference between the observed and modeled discharges was improved with an NSE equal to 0.80387 and an ANSE of 0.82874. Also, the IMERG-based model could reproduce the shape of the observed hydrographs, mainly under high flow conditions. Since IMERG products provide better accuracy, they were used for flood extent mapping in this study. Flood mapping results showed that the error was mostly within one pixel compared with the observed flood benchmark data of the Ottawa River acquired by RadarSat-2 during the flood event. The newly developed flood forecasting approach based on SPPs offers a solution for flood disaster management for poorly or totally ungauged watersheds regarding precipitation measurement.

However, its modelling in extreme cases is difficult, especially in semiarid regions. The main purpose of this paper is to evaluate the accuracy of artificial neural networks (ANNs) and hybrid wavelet-artificial neural networks (WA-ANNs) for multi-step monthly streamflow forecasting in two different hydro-climatic regions in Northern Algeria. Different issues have been addressed, both those related to the model's structure and those related to wavelet transform. The discrete wavelet transform has been used for the preprocessing of the input variables of the hybrid models, and the multi-step streamflow forecast was carried out by means of a recursive approach. The study demonstrated that WA-ANN models outperform the single ANN models for the two hydro-climatic regions. According to the performance criteria used, the results highlighted the ability of WA-ANN models with lagged streamflows, precipitations and evapotranspirations to forecast up to 19 months for the humid region with good accuracy [Nash-Sutcliffe criterion (N-s) equal 0.63], whereas, for the semiarid region, the introduction of evapotranspirations does not improve the model's accuracy for long lead time (N-s less than 0.6 for all combinations used). The maximum lead time achieved, for the semiarid region, was about 13 months, with only lagged streamflows as inputs.","[Fouchal, Amel; Souag-Gamane, Doudja] Univ Sci & Technol Houari Boumed, LEGHYD Lab, Dept Civil Engn, BP 32, Algiers, Algeria",,"Souag-Gamane, D (corresponding author), Univ Sci & Technol Houari Boumed, LEGHYD Lab, Dept Civil Engn, BP 32, Algiers, Algeria.",amfouchal@yahoo.com; souagd@yahoo.fr,"Doudja, SOUAG/ABF-7970-2021","SOUAG-GAMANE, Doudja/0000-0003-1777-3029",,,,60,3,3,2,11,SPRINGER INTERNATIONAL PUBLISHING AG,CHAM,"GEWERBESTRASSE 11, CHAM, CH-6330, SWITZERLAND",1895-6572,1895-7455,,ACTA GEOPHYS,Acta Geophys.,AUG,2019,67,4,,,,,1223,1240,,10.1007/s11600-019-00312-3,,,18,Geochemistry & Geophysics,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),Geochemistry & Geophysics,IK4AJ,WOS:000476529200016,,,,,2022-02-17

The hydrometeorological modeling chain includes the Weather Research and Forecasting Model (WRF) forcing the rainfall-runoff model MARINE dedicated to flash floods. Two distinct ensemble prediction systems accounting for (i) perturbed initial and lateral boundary conditions of the meteorological state and (ii) mesoscale model physical parameterizations have been implemented on the Agly catchment of the eastern Pyrenees with three subcatchments exhibiting different rainfall regimes. Different evaluations of the performance of the hydrometeorological strategies have been performed: (i) verification of short-range ensemble prediction systems and corresponding streamflow forecasts, for a better understanding of how forecasts behave; (ii) usual measures derived from a contingency table approach, to test an alert threshold exceedance; and (iii) overall evaluation of the hydrometeorological chain using the continuous rank probability score, for a general quantification of the ensemble performances. Results show that the overall discharge forecast is improved by both ensemble strategies with respect to the deterministic forecast. Threshold exceedance detections for flood warning also benefit from large hydrometeorological ensemble spread. There are no substantial differences between both ensemble strategies on these test cases in terms of both the issuance of flood warnings and the overall performances, suggesting that both sources of external-scale uncertainty are important to take into account.","[Roux, Helene] Univ Toulouse, CNRS, IMFT, Toulouse, France; [Amengual, Arnau; Romero, Romu] Univ Illes Balears, Grp Meteorol, Dept Fis, Palma De Mallorca, Majorca, Spain; [Blade, Ernest; Sanz-Ramos, Marcos] Univ Politecn Cataluna, ETS Eng Camins Canals & Ports Barcelona, Inst FLUMEN, Barcelona, Spain",,"Roux, H (corresponding author), Univ Toulouse, CNRS, IMFT, Toulouse, France.",helene.roux@imft.fr,"Sanz-Ramos, Marcos/AAE-9461-2019; Bladé, Ernest/L-9452-2014; Roux, Hélène/AAJ-7769-2021","Sanz-Ramos, Marcos/0000-0003-2534-0039; Bladé, Ernest/0000-0003-1770-3960; Roux, Hélène/0000-0001-7076-5015; Amengual, Arnau/0000-0002-6108-2850","call for projects Developpement durable, Ressource en eau - Gestion des risques of the Euroregion Pyrenees-Mediterranee; FEDER fundsEuropean Commission [PCIN-2015-221, CGL2017-82868-R]; French Central Service for Flood Forecasting (SCHAPI)","This work was carried out in the framework of the PGRI-EPM project (Prevision et gestion du risque d'inondation en Euroregion Pyrenees Mediterranee) funded by the call for projects Developpement durable, Ressource en eau - Gestion des risques of the Euroregion Pyrenees-Mediterranee.

Therefore, the flow forecasts for these plants subsidize the decision making within the scope of the Electric Sector, since they allow the evaluation of the operational conditions of the hydroelectric and thermoelectric plants through the use of energy optimization models, providing gains in the operations of SIN (Sistema Interligado Nacional - the Brazilian National Interconnected System). The precipitation forecast is of fundamental importance for the elaboration of these hydroelectric flow forecasts. For energy evaluations, the DECOMP and NEWAVE models are used, with the GEVAZP model being applied to generate scenarios through an AR (p) (autoregressive) model. Accordingly, this study shows the impact of precipitation forecast on flow predictions in the climate horizon. For this, a statistical correction was made in the rain predicted by the CFS (Climate Forecast System) model, which tends to overestimate the predicted rain, with rainfall-flow models being calibrated. Tests were performed with this new modeling system and the results, in the form of scenarios, were compared with the scenarios generated by the GEVAZP model, showing the possibility of reducing the generated range by the latter, consequently causing the DECOMP model to not consider ranges with little or no probability of occurrence, which can improve the optimization of the SIN operation planning. This work also shows that the SMAP model exhibited better performance when compared to the Neural Networks model, in terms of the average flow range predicted in relation to the observed flow. There was a clear improvement in the flow predictions with the incorporation of the rain observed one month ahead in the simulations, mainly in the forecast of high flows. Finally, the climate indices had a good relationship with the flow and rain variables.","[Gomes De Paiva, Luana Ferreira; Montenegro, Suzana Maria] Univ Fed Pernambuco, Recife, PE, Brazil; [Cataldi, Marcio] Univ Fed Fluminense, Niteroi, RJ, Brazil",,"De Paiva, LFG (corresponding author), Univ Fed Pernambuco, Recife, PE, Brazil.",luanag@ons.org.br; suzanam@ufpe.br; mcataldi@id.uff.br,"; Montenegro, Suzana/P-2632-2014","Cataldi, Marcio/0000-0001-9769-0105; Paiva, Luana/0000-0002-6154-2706; Montenegro, Suzana/0000-0002-2520-5761",ONS (Operador Nacional do Sistema Eletrico - the Brazilian National Electric System Operator); CNPqConselho Nacional de Desenvolvimento Cientifico e Tecnologico (CNPQ) [431980/2018-7],"The authors would like to thank ONS (Operador Nacional do Sistema Eletrico - the Brazilian National Electric System Operator) for the availability of the flow information used in this study and the researcher Reginaldo Ventura de Sa, a PhD student at UFF (Universidade Federal Fluminense - Fluminense Federal University Brazil), for the availability of the CFS model rainfall data.

In this study we employed a 50-model ensemble of three data-driven predictive models, namely the support vector regression (SVR), multivariate adaptive regression spline (MARS) and M5 model tree (M5Tree) to forecast river flow data in a semiarid and ecologically significant mountainous region of Pailugou catchment in northwestern China. To attain stable and accurate forecast results, 50 different models were trained by randomly sampling the entire river flow data into 80% for training and 20% for testing subsets. To attain a complete evaluation of the ensemble-model based results, the global mean of six quantitative statistical performance evaluation measures: the coefficient of correlation (R), mean absolute relative error (MAE), root mean squared error (RMSE), Nash-Sutcliffe efficiency coefficient (NS), relative RMSE, and the Willmott's Index (WI), and Taylor diagrams, including skill scores relative to a persistence model, were selected to assess the performances of the developed predictive models. The results indicated that all of the averaged R value attained was higher than 0.900 and all of the averaged NS values were higher than 0.800, representing good performance of the SVR, MARS and M5Tree models applied in the 1-, 2- and 3-day ahead modeling horizon, and this also accorded with the deductions made through an assessment of the Willmott's Index. However, the M5Tree model outperformed both the SVR and MARS models (with NS = 0.917 vs. 0.904 and 0.901 for 1-day, 0.893 vs. 0.854 and 0.845 for 2-day, and 0.850 vs. 0.828 and 0.810 for 3-day forecasting horizons, respectively), which was in concurrence with the high value of WI. Therefore, based on the ensemble of 50 models, the performance of the M5Tree can be considered as superior to the SVR and MARS models when applied in a problem of river flow forecasting at multiple forecast horizon. A detailed comparison of the overall performance of all three models evaluated through Taylor diagrams and boxplots indicated that the 1-day ahead forecasting results were more accurate for all of the predictive models compared to the 2- and 3-day ahead forecasting horizons. Data-intelligent models designed in this study indicate that the M5Tree method could successfully be explored for short-term river flow forecasting in semiarid mountainous regions, which may have useful implications in water resources management, ecological sustainability and assessment of river systems.","[Yin, Zhenliang; Feng, Qi; Wen, Xiaohu; Deo, Ravinesh C.; Yang, Linshan; Si, Jianhua; He, Zhibin] Chinese Acad Sci, Key Lab Ecohydrol Inland River Basin, Northwest Inst Ecoenvironm & Resources, Lanzhou 730000, Gansu, Peoples R China; [Deo, Ravinesh C.] Univ Southern Queensland, Sch Agr Computat & Environm Sci, Inst Agr & Environm IAg&E, Springfield, Australia",,"Wen, XH; Deo, RC (corresponding author), Chinese Acad Sci, Key Lab Ecohydrol Inland River Basin, Northwest Inst Ecoenvironm & Resources, Lanzhou 730000, Gansu, Peoples R China.; Deo, RC (corresponding author), Univ Southern Queensland, Sch Agr Computat & Environm Sci, Inst Agr & Environm IAg&E, Springfield, Australia.",xhwen@lzb.ac.cn; Ravinesh.Deo@usq.edu.au,"Deo, Ravinesh/F-6157-2012; Wen, Xiaohu/AAE-3378-2021","Deo, Ravinesh/0000-0002-2290-6749; ","National Key R&D Program of China [2017YFC0404302, 2016YFC0400908]; National Natural Science Foundation of ChinaNational Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC) [41601038]; Key Research Program of Frontier Sciences, CAS [QYZDJ-SSW-DQC031]; CAS Light of West China'' Program; China Postdoctoral Science FoundationChina Postdoctoral Science Foundation [2015M572620]; Foundation for Excellent Youth Scholars of Northwest Institute of Eco-Environment and Resources, CAS; CASChinese Academy of Sciences","This work was supported by the National Key R&D Program of China (Grant Numbers 2017YFC0404302, 2016YFC0400908), and the National Natural Science Foundation of China (Grant Number 41601038), and the Key Research Program of Frontier Sciences, CAS (Grant Number QYZDJ-SSW-DQC031), and CAS Light of West China'' Program, and the China Postdoctoral Science Foundation (Grant Number 2015M572620), and the Foundation for Excellent Youth Scholars of Northwest Institute of Eco-Environment and Resources, CAS.

How to improve forecast accuracy is a great challenge in hydrological studies. A lot of research has been conducted to address the streamflow forecasting problem, however, few methods are developed to make a systematic research. The objective of this study is to understand the underlying trend of streamflow so that a regression model can be developed to forecast the flow volume. In this paper, a hybrid streamflow forecast framework is proposed that integrates factor analysis, time series decomposition, data regression, and error suppression. Correlation coefficients between the current streamflow and the streamflow with lags are analyzed using autocorrelation function (ACF), partial autocorrelation function (PACE), and grey correlation analysis (GCA). Support vector regression (SVR) and generalized regression neural network (GRNN) models are integrated with seasonal and trend decomposition to make monthly streamflow forecast. Auto-regression and multi-model combination error correction methods are used to ensure the accuracy. In our experiments, the proposed method is compared with a stochastic autoregressive integrated moving average (ARIMA) streamflow forecast model. Fourteen models are developed, and the monthly streamflow data of Shigu and Xiangjiaba, China from 1961 to 2009 are used to evaluate our proposed method. Our results demonstrate that the integrated model of grey correlation analysis, Seasonal-Trend Decomposition Procedure Based on Loess (STL), Support Vector Regression (GCA-STL-SVR) exhibits an improved performance for monthly streamflow forecast. The average error of the proposed model is reduced to less than one-tenth in contrast to the state-of-the-art method and the standard deviation is also reduced by more than 30%, which implies a greater consistency.","[Luo, Xiangang; Zhu, Shuang; Xu, Zhanya; Peng, Jing] China Univ Geosci, Fac Informat Engn, Wuhan, Hubei, Peoples R China; [Yuan, Xiaohui] Univ North Texas, Dept Comp Sci & Engn, Denton, TX 76210 USA; [Meng, Lingsheng] Hubei Jinlang Survey & Design Co LTD, Luoshi Rd, Wuhan 430074, Hubei, Peoples R China",,"Yuan, XH (corresponding author), Univ North Texas, Dept Comp Sci & Engn, Denton, TX 76210 USA.",xiaohui.yuan@unt.edu,"Yuan, Xiaohui/AAQ-1172-2020","Zhu, Shuang/0000-0001-7667-4093; Yuan, Xiaohui/0000-0001-6897-4563",National Natural Science Foundation of ChinaNational Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC) [51809242]; China scholarship councilChina Scholarship Council,"This work is supported by the National Natural Science Foundation of China (No: 51809242), and special thanks are given to the China scholarship council's support and the anonymous reviewers and editors for their constructive comments.",,40,44,45,7,57,ELSEVIER,AMSTERDAM,"RADARWEG 29, 1043 NX AMSTERDAM, NETHERLANDS",0022-1694,1879-2707,,J HYDROL,J.

It becomes more important in mountain areas because most of the downstream populations have high dependency for their livelihood, agriculture, and commercial activities like hydro power production. In this context, in recent times, machine learning models have got high attention due to their high accuracy in forecasting through self-learning from physical processes. In this work, we consider the potential of a data driven methods of machine learning, namely multilayer perceptron (MLP), support vector regression (SVR), and random forest (RF), are explored to forecast Hunza river flow in Pakistan using in-situ dataset for the period from 1962 to 2008. A set of five input combinations with lagged river flow values are developed based on the autocorrelation (ACF) and partial autocorrelation function (PACF) on historical river flow data. A comparative investigation is conducted to assess the performance of MLP, SVR and RF. The results of machine learning models are compared using forecasting metrics defined as correlation coefficient (R), mean absolute error (MAE), root mean square error (RMSE), and mean square error (MSE) between the observed and forecasted river flow data to assess the models' effectiveness. The results show that RF performed the best followed by MLP and SVR. In measurable terms, superiority of RF over MPL and SVR models was demonstrated by R-2 = 0.993, 0.910, and 0.831, RMSE = 0.069, 0.084, and 0.104, MAE = 0.040, 0.058, and 0.062, respectively.

The application of artificial intelligence, in comparison with physical and empirical models, can be effective in the face of the complexity of hydrological processes. The present study was prepared with the aim of increasing the accuracy in monthly prediction of rainfall (R) and pan evaporation (EP) by providing a simple solution to determining new inputs for forecasting scenarios. Initially, the prediction of two parameters, R and EP, for the current and one-three lead times, by determining the different input modes, was developed with the SVM model. Then, in order to increase the accuracy of the predictions, the month number (tau) was added to all scenarios in predicting both the R and EP parameters. The results of the intelligent model using several statistical indices (i.e., root mean square error (RMSE), Kling-Gupta (KGE) and correlation coefficient (CC)), with the help of case visual indicators, were compared. The month number (tau) was able to greatly improve the prediction accuracy of both the R and EP parameters under the SVM model and overcome the complexities within these two hydrological processes that the scenarios were not initially able to solve with high accuracy. This is proven in all time steps. According to the RMSE, KGE and CC indices, the highest increase in the forecast accuracy for the upcoming two months of rainfall (Rt+2) for Ardabil station in scenario 2 (SVM-2) was 19.1, 858 and 125%, and for the current month of pan evaporation (EPt) for Urmia station in scenario 6 (SVM-6), this occurred at the rates of 40.2, 11.1 and 7.6%, respectively. Finally, in order to investigate the characteristic of the month number in the SVM model under special conditions such as considering the highest values of the R and EP time series, it was proved that by using the month number of the SVM model, again, the accuracy could be improved (on average, 17% improvement for rainfall, and 13% for pan evaporation) in almost all time steps. Due to the wide range of effects of the two variables studied in the hydrological discussion, the results of the present study can be useful in agricultural sciences and in water management in general and will help owners.","[Meidute-Kavaliauskiene, Ieva; Davidaviciene, Vida] Vilnius Gediminas Tech Univ, Dept Business Technol & Entrepreneurship, LT-10223 Vilnius, Lithuania; [Jabehdar, Milad Alizadeh; Ghorbani, Mohammad Ali] Univ Tabriz, Fac Agr, Dept Water Engn, Tabriz 5166616471, Iran; [Sammen, Saad Sh] Diyala Univ, Coll Engn, Dept Civil Engn, Baqubah 32001, Diyala, Iraq",,"Meidute-Kavaliauskiene, I (corresponding author), Vilnius Gediminas Tech Univ, Dept Business Technol & Entrepreneurship, LT-10223 Vilnius, Lithuania.",ieva.meidute-kavaliauskiene@vilniustech.lt; malizadehj97@gmail.com; vida.davidaviciene@vilniustech.lt; ghorbani@tabrizu.ac.ir; Saad123engineer@yahoo.com,"Sammen, Saad Shauket Shauket/F-3370-2019; Meidute-Kavaliauskiene, Ieva/AAD-6877-2019; Davidaviciene, Vida/L-5303-2018","Sammen, Saad Shauket Shauket/0000-0002-1708-0612; Meidute-Kavaliauskiene, Ieva/0000-0003-0435-7632; Davidaviciene, Vida/0000-0002-0931-0967",,,,33,0,0,1,2,MDPI,BASEL,"ST ALBAN-ANLAGE 66, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND",,2071-1050,,SUSTAINABILITY-BASEL,Sustainability,JUL,2021,13,14,,,,,,,7752,10.3390/su13147752,,,19,Green & Sustainable Science & Technology; Environmental Sciences; Environmental Studies,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Science & Technology - Other Topics; Environmental Sciences & Ecology,TO4LH,WOS:000676884800001,,gold,,,2022-02-17

Especially in remote areas, where reliability issues associated with integrated systems result in problems of insufficient power supply or supply loss due to the intermittency of renewable sources and varying freshwater demand. This research aims to design a sustainable and reliable hybrid renewable energy system (HRES) coupled with RO desalination system (HRES-RO), considering different operational scenarios with fluctuating renewable energy supply, and changeable water.demand. First, future energy supply from renewable sources, and water demand were forecasted to deal with the stochastic behavior of several variables including freshwater demand, ambient temperature, solar radiation, and wind speed by means of recurrent neural networks (RNN). Then, multi-criteria optimization was conducted using extended mathematical programming (EMP) with the aim of minimizing the total annual costs and greenhouse gas emission. Finally, the potential loss of power supply probability (PLPSP) was introduced as a tool to illustrate the sustainability of the proposed scenarios. The results showed that the proposed framework resulted in an HRES with optimized installation strategy using 111 photovoltaic panels and 5 wind turbines by considering three criteria (economic cost, environmental effect, and energy reliability). The designed system reduced PLPSP by 18.3% compared with the base case.

Seasonal autoregressive integrated moving average (SARIMA) models have been frequently used for predicting river flow. SARIMA models are linear and do not consider the random component of statistical data. To overcome this shortcoming, monthly inflow is predicted in this study based on a combination of seasonal autoregressive integrated moving average (SARIMA) and gene expression programming (GEP) models, which is a new hybrid method (SARIMA-GEP). To this end, a four-step process is employed. First, the monthly inflow datasets are pre-processed. Second, the datasets are modelled linearly with SARIMA and in the third stage, the non-linearity of residual series caused by linear modelling is evaluated. After confirming the non-linearity, the residuals are modelled in the fourth step using a gene expression programming (GEP) method. The proposed hybrid model is employed to predict the monthly inflow to the Jamishan Dam in west Iran. Thirty years' worth of site measurements of monthly reservoir dam inflow with extreme seasonal variations are used. The results of this hybrid model (SARIMA-GEP) are compared with SARIMA, GEP, artificial neural network (ANN) and SARIMA-ANN models. The results indicate that the SARIMA-GEP model (R-2=78.8, VAF=78.8, RMSE=0.89, MAPE=43.4, CRM=0.053) outperforms SARIMA and GEP and SARIMA-ANN (R-2=68.3, VAF=66.4, RMSE=1.12, MAPE=56.6, CRM=0.032) displays better performance than the SARIMA and ANN models. A comparison of the two hybrid models indicates the superiority of SARIMA-GEP over the SARIMA-ANN model.","[Moeeni, Hamid; Bonakdari, Hossein; Ebtehaj, Isa] Razi Univ, Dept Civil Engn, Kermanshah, Iran",,"Bonakdari, H (corresponding author), Razi Univ, Dept Civil Engn, Kermanshah, Iran.",bonakdari@yahoo.com,"Bonakdari, Hossein/B-9305-2018; Ebtehaj, Isa/I-7289-2018; Bonakdari, Hossein/AAW-5398-2021","Bonakdari, Hossein/0000-0001-6169-3654; Ebtehaj, Isa/0000-0002-6906-629X; ",,,,46,22,22,8,27,INDIAN ACAD SCIENCES,BANGALORE,"C V RAMAN AVENUE, SADASHIVANAGAR, P B #8005, BANGALORE 560 080, INDIA",2347-4327,0973-774X,,J EARTH SYST SCI,J.

Urbanization not only causes land use/cover (LUC) changes but also changes the flood responses of watersheds. Lumped conceptual hydrological models cannot be effectively used for flood forecasting in watersheds that lack long time series of hydrological data to calibrate model parameters. Thus, physically based distributed hydrological models are used instead in these areas, but considerable uncertainty is associated with model parameter derivation. To reduce model parameter uncertainty in physically based distributed hydrological models for flood forecasting in highly urbanized watersheds, a procedure is proposed to control parameter uncertainty. The core concept of this procedure is to identify the key hydrological and flood processes in the highly urbanized watersheds and the sensitive model parameters related to these processes. Then, the sensitive model parameters are adjusted based on local runoff coefficients to reduce the parameter uncertainty. This procedure includes these steps: collecting the latest LUC information or estimating this information using satellite remote sensing images, analyzing LUC spatial patterns and identifying dominant LUC types and their spatial structures, choosing and establishing a distributed hydrological model as the forecasting tool, and determining the initial model parameters and identifying the key hydrological processes and sensitive model parameters based on a parameter sensitivity analysis. A highly urbanized watershed called Shahe Creek in the Pearl River Delta area was selected as a case study. This study finds that the runoff production processes associated with both the ferric luvisol and acric ferralsol soil types and the runoff routing process on urban land are key hydrological processes. Additionally, the soil water content under saturated conditions, the soil water content under field conditions and the roughness of urban land are sensitive parameters.","[Wang, Huanyu; Chen, Yangbo] Sun Yat Sen Univ, Sch Geog & Planning, Guangzhou 510275, Guangdong, Peoples R China",,"Chen, YB (corresponding author), Sun Yat Sen Univ, Sch Geog & Planning, Guangzhou 510275, Guangdong, Peoples R China.",eescyb@mail.sysu.edu.cn,,,National Key Research and Development Program of China [2017YFC1502702]; National Science and Technology Pillar Program [2015BAK11B02]; Science and Technology Program of Guangdong Province [2014A050503031],"This study was supported by the National Key Research and Development Program of China (no. 2017YFC1502702), the National Science and Technology Pillar Program during the Twentieth Five-year Plan Period (no. 2015BAK11B02) and the Science and Technology Program of Guangdong Province (no. 2014A050503031).",,85,5,5,8,15,MDPI,BASEL,"ST ALBAN-ANLAGE 66, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND",,2073-4441,,WATER-SUI,Water,AUG,2019,11,8,,,,,,,1641,10.3390/w11081641,,,22,Environmental Sciences; Water Resources,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),Environmental Sciences & Ecology; Water Resources,IV9CM,WOS:000484561500115,,gold,,,2022-02-17

The goal of this research is to investigate and perform short-term forecasting of both streamflow and hydrological drought trends over the island. Eleven hydrometric stations with a 34-year common record length of the mean daily discharge from 10/1979 to 09/2013 are used for this purpose, with the relevant upstream catchments considered to represent pristine conditions. The Streamflow Drought Index (SDI) successfully captures the hydrological drought conditions over the island, and the performance of the index is validated based on both the historic drought archives and results from other drought indices for the island. The Mann-Kendall (M-K) test reveals that the annual and seasonal time series of the discharge volumes always illustrate a decreasing but insignificant trend at a significance level of a = 0.05; additionally, the decrease per decade in the average annual streamflow volume based on Sen's slope statistic is approximately -9.4%. The M-K test on the SDI reveals that drought conditions intensified with time. Ten autoregressive integrated moving average (ARIMA) models are built and used to forecast the mean monthly streamflow values with moderate accuracy; the best ARIMA forecast model in each catchment is derived by comparing two model-performance statistical measures for the different (p,d,q) model parameters. The predicted discharge values are processed by the SDI-3 index, revealing that non-drought conditions are expected in most catchments in the upcoming three months, although mild-drought conditions are anticipated for catchments 7, 8 and 9.","[Myronidis, Dimitrios] Aristotle Univ Thessaloniki, Sch Forestry & Nat Environm, Univ Campus,POB 268, Thessaloniki 54124, Greece; [Ioannou, Konstantinos] Eastern Macedonia & Thrace Inst Technol, Dept Forestry & Nat Environm Management, 1st Km Dramas Mikrochoriou, Drama 66100, Greece; [Fotakis, Dimitrios] Inst Plant Breeding & Phytogenet Resources, Hellen Agr Org Demeter, POB 60458, Thessaloniki 57001, Greece; [Dorflinger, Gerald] Water Dev Dept, Div Hydrometry, 100-110 Kennenty Ave, CY-1047 Pallouriotissa, Lefkosia, Cyprus",,"Myronidis, D (corresponding author), Aristotle Univ Thessaloniki, Sch Forestry & Nat Environm, Univ Campus,POB 268, Thessaloniki 54124, Greece.",myronid@gmail.com,"Ioannou, Konstantinos/J-9096-2019; Myronidis, Dimitrios/ABD-8611-2020","Ioannou, Konstantinos/0000-0003-0749-099X; Myronidis, Dimitrios/0000-0001-7549-2255; Dorflinger, Gerald/0000-0003-0209-4648",,,,66,42,42,1,39,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0920-4741,1573-1650,,WATER RESOUR MANAG,Water Resour.

Next, the future total freight volumes among these O-D pairs are forecasted by using the gray prediction model, and the sharing rate of RSDT is estimated by using the logit model.

These inherent features make them difficult to forecast, especially in a changing environment. To improve forecasting accuracy, an innovation uncertainty forecasting architecture is developed by coupling data decomposition method, feature selection, multiple artificial intelligence (AI) techniques and composite strategy to do unstable time series forecasting. In the designed architecture, the AVMD (adaptive variational mode decomposition) is first applied to excavate implicit information from the original time series. Then, the random forest is utilized to select the suitable inputs for each mode. After that, the GPR (Gaussian Process Regression), a very famous probabilistic AI technique, is driven by various neural networks (ELM (Extreme Learning Machine), BP (Back Propagation Neural Networks), GRNN(Generalized Regression Neural Networks) and RBF (Radial Basis Function Neural Networks)) to produce both deterministic and probabilistic forecasting results in a nonlinear manner to play strengths of each other. The effectiveness and applicability of the proposed approach is verified by unstable wind speed data and streamflow data, and also compared with eleven related models. Results indicate that the proposed model not only improves the forecasting accuracy for deterministic predictions, but also provides more probabilistic information for decision making. The proposed method achieves significantly better performance than the traditional forecasting models both on wind speed forecasting and streamflow forecasting with at least 50% average performance promotion over all the eleven competitors. Comprehensive comparisons demonstrate the superior performance of the proposed method than the involved models as a powerful tool for unstable series forecasting.","[Sun, Na; Peng, Tian] Huaiyin Inst Technol, Coll Automat, Huaian 223003, Peoples R China; [Zhang, Shuai] Xi An Jiao Tong Univ, Sch Energy & Power Engn, Minist Educ, Key Lab Thermofluid Sci & Engn, Xian 710049, Peoples R China; [Zhou, Jianzhong] Huazhong Univ Sci & Technol, Sch Hydropower & Informat Engn, Wuhan 430074, Peoples R China; [Sun, Xinguo] Huaiyin Inst Technol, Coll Management & Engn, Jiangsu Smart Factory Engn Res Ctr, Huaian 223003, Peoples R China",,"Sun, N (corresponding author), Huaiyin Inst Technol, Coll Automat, Huaian 223003, Peoples R China.",sunna1347@126.com,,"Peng, Tian/0000-0002-1811-2313","National Natural Science Foundation of ChinaNational Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC) [91547208, 51909010]; Natural Science Foundation of the Jiangsu Higher Education Institutions of ChinaNational Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC) [19KJB480007, 19KJB470012]","This work was supported in part by the National Natural Science Foundation of China under Grant 91547208 and Grant 51909010, and in part by the Natural Science Foundation of the Jiangsu Higher Education Institutions of China under Grant 19KJB480007 and Grant 19KJB470012.",,44,1,1,7,14,IEEE-INST ELECTRICAL ELECTRONICS ENGINEERS INC,PISCATAWAY,"445 HOES LANE, PISCATAWAY, NJ 08855-4141 USA",2169-3536,,,IEEE ACCESS,IEEE Access,,2020,8,,,,,,209251,209266,,10.1109/ACCESS.2020.3034127,,,16,"Computer Science, Information Systems; Engineering, Electrical & Electronic; Telecommunications",Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),Computer Science; Engineering; Telecommunications,OZ6DS,WOS:000595015000001,,gold,,,2022-02-17

This stems in part from the fact that, in many cases, calibration is based on recorded time series that do not comprise extreme events. The problem is particularly relevant in the case of data-driven models, which are focused in this work. Based on synthetic and real world streamflow forecasting examples, two main research questions are addressed: 1) would/should the models chosen by established practice be maintained were extreme events being considered and 2) how can established practice be improved in order to reduce the risks associated with the poor forecasting of extreme events? Among the data-driven models employed in streamflow forecasting, Support Vector Regression (SVR) has earned the researchers' interest due to its good comparative performance. The present contribution builds upon the theory underlying this model in order to illustrate and discuss its tendency to predictably underestimate extreme flood peaks, raising awareness to the obvious risks that entails. While focusing on SVR, the work highlights dangers potentially present in other non-linear regularized models. The results clearly show that, under certain conditions, established practices for validation and choice may fail to identify the best models for predicting extreme streamflow events. Also, the paper puts forward practical recommendations that may help avoiding potential problems, namely: establishing up to what return period does the model maintain good performances; privileging small lambda hyperparameters in Radial Basis Function (RBF) SVR models; preferring linear models when their validation performances are similar to those of non-linear models; and making use of predictions made by more than one type of data-driven model.","[Matos, Jos P.] Ecole Polytech Fed Lausanne, Lab Construct Hydraul, EPFL ENAC IIC LCH, GC F1 494,Stn 18, CH-1015 Lausanne, Switzerland; [Portela, Maria M.] Univ Lisbon, Inst Super Tecn, Lisbon, Portugal; [Schleiss, Anton J.] Ecole Polytech Fed Lausanne, Lab Construct Hydraul, Lausanne, Switzerland",,"Matos, JP (corresponding author), Ecole Polytech Fed Lausanne, Lab Construct Hydraul, EPFL ENAC IIC LCH, GC F1 494,Stn 18, CH-1015 Lausanne, Switzerland.",jose.matos@epfl.ch,"Matos, José Pedro/AAE-6998-2021; Portela, Maria Manuela/P-6312-2017","Schleiss, Anton J./0000-0003-1559-5740; Portela, Maria Manuela/0000-0002-5221-1139",Ecole Polytechnique Federale de Lausanne (EPFL); Swiss Competence Center Environment and Sustainability (CCES); Portuguese Foundation for Science and Technology (FTC) [SFRH/BD/33669/2009],"This contribution was mainly supported by the Ecole Polytechnique Federale de Lausanne (EPFL) and the Swiss Competence Center Environment and Sustainability (CCES), with part of the work having been developed under the scholarship SFRH/BD/33669/2009 of the Portuguese Foundation for Science and Technology (FTC).

A statistical model is developed to predict the weekly frequency of extreme warm days and 14-day standardized precipitation index (SPI) during boreal summer in the United States. We use a leading principal component of U.S. soil moisture and an index based on the North Pacific sea surface temperature (SST) as predictors. The model outperforms the NCEP Climate Forecast System, version 2 (CFSv2), at weeks 3-4 in the eastern United States. It is found that the North Pacific SST anomalies persist for several weeks and are associated with a persistent wave train pattern, which leads to increased occurrences of blocking and extreme temperature over the eastern United States. Extreme dry soil moisture conditions persist into week 4 and are associated with an increase in sensible heat flux and a decrease in latent heat flux, which may help to maintain the overlying anticyclone. The clear-sky conditions associated with blocking anticyclones further decrease soil moisture and increase the frequency of extreme warm days. This skillful statistical model has the potential to aid in irrigation scheduling, crop planning, and reservoir operation and to provide mitigation of impacts from extreme heat events.","[Miller, Douglas E.; Wang, Zhuo] Univ Illinois, Dept Atmospher Sci, Urbana, IL 61820 USA; [Li, Bo] Univ Illinois, Dept Stat, Urbana, IL USA; [Harnos, Daniel S.] NOAA, NCEP, NWS, Climate Predict Ctr, College Pk, MD USA; [Ford, Trent] Univ Illinois, Prairie Res Inst, Illinois State Water Survey, Urbana, IL USA",,"Miller, DE (corresponding author), Univ Illinois, Dept Atmospher Sci, Urbana, IL 61820 USA.",dmiller23@niu.edu,,,"National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA)National Oceanic Atmospheric Admin (NOAA) - USA [NA18OAR4310271, NA18NWS4680065]",This work is supported by the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) Grants NA18OAR4310271 and NA18NWS4680065.

In order to avoid financial and human losses, the importance of flood forecasting seems inevitable. Considering that floods are caused by many natural and anthropogenic factors and also have limitations such as lack of complete information. In this study, artificial neural networks have been used as an efficient method for flood prediction. The neural network inputs include the Dubai River and the Eshel River, this data was collected over 8 Years from the Maroon River. The network used is a multilayer perceptron, also the neural network weights are optimized by the Gray wolf algorithm and the results are compared with other common methods. Analysis of the output results shows that the neural network with the Gray Wolf algorithm has better results than neural network and Genetic algorithms and the error of this method is 0.53%, which indicates high accuracy and precision for flood prediction compared to other evolutionary algorithms. This method is used to obtain the best amount of data for testing and training. As the results, the best rate is 80% for training and 20% for testing. Obtained results show the neural network error squares with 80% of the training data and 20% of the test data.","[Doumari, Sajjad Amiri] Sirjan Univ Technol, Dept Math & Comp Sci, Sirjan, Iran",,"Doumari, SA (corresponding author), Sirjan Univ Technol, Dept Math & Comp Sci, Sirjan, Iran.",amiri@sirjantech.ac.ir,,,,,,22,0,0,0,0,"ALEXANDRU IOAN CUZA UNIV PRESS, FAC GEOGRAPHY & GEOLOGY",IASI,"STR PINILUI NR 1A, IASI, ROMANIA",1843-5971,2284-7820,,PRESENT ENV SUST DEV,Present Environ.

Forecast of rainfall offers attention to individuals and knows in advance about rainfall to avoid potential risk to shield their crop yields from severe rainfall. This study intends to investigate the dependability of integrating a data pre-processing technique called singular-spectrum-analysis (SSA) with supervised learning models called least-squares support vector regression (LS-SVR), and Random-Forest (RF), for rainfall prediction. Integrating SSA with LS-SVR and RF, the combined framework is designed and contrasted with the customary approaches (LS-SVR and RF). The presented frameworks were trained and tested utilizing a monthly climate dataset which is separated into 80:20 ratios for training and testing respectively. Performance of the model was assessed using Root Mean Square Error (RMSE) and Nash-Sutcliffe Efficiency (NSE) and the proposed model produces the values as 71.6 %, 90.2 % respectively.

Seasonal drought early warning is thus vital for the whole region. In this study, the predictability of hydrological droughts during the main runoff period from December to May is assessed using statistical approaches. Three methods (multiple linear models, artificial neural networks, random forest regression trees) are compared in terms of their ability to forecast streamflow with up to 12 months of lead time. The following four main findings result from the study. 1. There are stations in the basin at which standardised streamflow is predictable with lead times up to 12 months. The results show high inter-station differences of forecast skill but reach a coefficient of determination as high as 0.73 (cross validated). 2. A large range of potential predictors is considered in this study, comprising well-established climate indices, customised teleconnection indices derived from sea surface temperatures and antecedent streamflow as a proxy of catchment conditions. El Nino and customised indices, representing sea surface temperature in the Atlantic and Indian oceans, prove to be important teleconnection predictors for the region. Antecedent streamflow is a strong predictor in small catchments (with median 42% explained variance), whereas teleconnections exert a stronger influence in large catchments. 3. Multiple linear models show the best forecast skill in this study and the greatest robustness compared to artificial neural networks and random forest regression trees, despite their capabilities to represent nonlinear relationships. 4. Employed in early warning, the models can be used to forecast a specific drought level. Even if the coefficient of determination is low, the forecast models have a skill better than a climatological forecast, which is shown by analysis of receiver operating characteristics (ROCs). Seasonal statistical forecasts in the Limpopo show promising results, and thus it is recommended to employ them as complementary to existing forecasts in order to strengthen preparedness for droughts.","[Seibert, Mathias; Merz, Bruno; Apel, Heiko] GFZ German Ctr Geosci, Sect Hydrol 4, Sect Hydrol 5, Potsdam, Germany; [Merz, Bruno] Univ Potsdam, Inst Earth & Environm Sci, Potsdam, Germany",,"Seibert, M (corresponding author), GFZ German Ctr Geosci, Sect Hydrol 4, Sect Hydrol 5, Potsdam, Germany.",mathias.seibert@gmail.com,"Apel, Heiko/AAY-9969-2020; Apel, Heiko/G-6280-2013","Apel, Heiko/0000-0002-8852-652X; Apel, Heiko/0000-0002-8852-652X; Merz, Bruno/0000-0002-5992-1440",European UnionEuropean Commission,We thank the European Union for funding the work under the EU-FP7 project DEWFORA (Improved Drought Early Warning and Forecasting to strengthen preparedness and adaptation to droughts in Africa).,,63,32,32,2,44,COPERNICUS GESELLSCHAFT MBH,GOTTINGEN,"BAHNHOFSALLEE 1E, GOTTINGEN, 37081, GERMANY",1027-5606,1607-7938,,HYDROL EARTH SYST SC,Hydrol.

In this study, the sensitivity of the RCM, weather research and forecasting (WRF), in modeling the regional climate of the Nile River Basin (NRB) was investigated using 31 combinations of different physical parameterization schemes which include cumulus (Cu), microphysics (MP), planetary boundary layer (PBL), land-surface model (LSM) and radiation (Ra) schemes. Using the European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecast (ECMWF) ERA-Interim reanalysis data as initial and lateral boundary conditions, WRF was configured to model the climate of NRB at a resolution of 36 km with 30 vertical levels. The 1999-2001 simulations using WRF were compared with satellite data combined with ground observation and the NCEP reanalysis data for 2 m surface air temperature (T2), rainfall, short- and longwave downward radiation at the surface (SWRAD, LWRAD). Overall, WRF simulated more accurate T2 and LWRAD (with correlation coefficients > 0.8 and low root-mean-square error) than SWRAD and rainfall for the NRB. Further, the simulation of rainfall is more sensitive to PBL, Cu and MP schemes than other schemes of WRF. For example, WRF simulated less biased rainfall with Kain-Fritsch combined with MYJ than with YSU as the PBL scheme. The simulation of T2 is more sensitive to LSM and Ra than to Cu, PBL and MP schemes selected, SWRAD is more sensitive to MP and Ra than to Cu, LSM and PBL schemes, and LWRAD is more sensitive to LSM, Ra and PBL than Cu, and MP schemes. In summary, the following combination of schemes simulated the most representative regional climate of NRB: WSM3 microphysics, KF cumulus, MYJ PBL, RRTM longwave radiation and Dudhia shortwave radiation schemes, and Noah LSM. The above configuration of WRF coupled to the Noah LSM has also been shown to simulate representative regional climate of NRB over 1980-2001 which include a combination of wet and dry years of the NRB.","[Tariku, Tebikachew Betru; Gan, Thian Yew] Univ Alberta, Dept Civil & Environm Engn, Edmonton, AB T6G 1H9, Canada",,"Gan, TY (corresponding author), Univ Alberta, Dept Civil & Environm Engn, Edmonton, AB T6G 1H9, Canada.",tgan@ualberta.ca,,"Gan, Thian Yew/0000-0002-5196-2846",Natural Science and Engineering Research Council of CanadaNatural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada (NSERC); University of AlbertaUniversity of Alberta,"The authors would like to thank Chun Chao Kuo for his valuable advice and support throughout this study.

Soft computing and machine learning techniques are becoming popular day by day for their predictive capability when limited input data are available. In the present study, Support Vector Machine (SVM) technique is applied to forecast 1-day, 3-day, and 5-day ahead streamflow using daily streamflow time-series of Khanapur, Cholachguda, and Navalgund gauging stations in Malaprabha sub-basin located in the Karnataka state of India. Furthermore, Discrete Wavelet Transform is used as a data pre-processing method to evaluate the performance enhancement of SVM model, for which four different mother wavelet functions are used and tested separately, namely, Haar, Daubechies, Coiflets, and Symlets. Models are evaluated using coefficient of determination (R-2), root-mean-square error, and Nash-Sutcliffe efficiency. The study indicates that the performance of SVM model improves considerably when wavelet method is coupled. It is found that the R-2 values for Khanapur station using SVM are 0.91, 0.66, and 0.46 for 1-day, 3-day, and 5-day lead-time forecasts, respectively. However, when wavelet method is coupled with SVM model, the R-2 is improved to 0.99, 0.73, and 0.68 for 1-day, 3-day, and 5-day lead-time forecasts, respectively.","[Kambalimath, Shruti S.; Deka, Paresh Chandra] Natl Inst Technol Karnataka, Surathkal, Mangaluru, India",,"Kambalimath, SS (corresponding author), Natl Inst Technol Karnataka, Surathkal, Mangaluru, India.",shruti.kambalimath38@gmail.com,,,,,,43,3,3,3,8,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"ONE NEW YORK PLAZA, SUITE 4600, NEW YORK, NY, UNITED STATES",1866-6280,1866-6299,,ENVIRON EARTH SCI,Environ.

It is important to understand the drivers of Alex-andrium blooms to inform shellfish management and aquaculture, as well as to predict trends of PST in a changing climate. In this study, we aggregate environmental data sets from multiple agencies and tribal partners to model and predict concentrations of PSTs in Southeast Alaska from 2016 to 2019. We used daily PST concentrations interpolated from regularly sampled blue mussels (Mytilus trossulus) analyzed for total PSTs using a receptor binding assay. We then created random forest models to classify shellfish above and below a threshold of toxicity (80 mu g 100 g(-1)) and used two methods to determine variable importance. We obtained a multivariate model with key variables being sea surface temperature, salinity, freshwater discharge, and air temperature. We then used a similar model trained using lagged environmental variables to hindcast out-of-sample (OOS) shellfish toxicities during April-October in 2017, 2018, and 2019. Hindcast OOS accuracies were low (37-50%); however, we found forecasting using environmental variables may be useful in predicting the timing of early summer blooms. This study reinforces the efficacy of machine learning to determine important drivers of harmful algal blooms, although more complex models incorporating other parameters such as toxicokinetics are likely needed for accurate regional forecasts.","[Harley, John R. y; Bidlack, Allison] Univ Alaska Southeast, Alaska Coastal Rainforest Ctr, 11066 Auke Lake Way, Juneau, AK 99801 USA; [Lanphier, Kari; Kennedy, Esther; Whitehead, Chris] Sitka Tribe Alaska, Environm Res Lab, 456 Katlian St, Sitka, AK 99835 USA",,"Harley, JR (corresponding author), Univ Alaska Southeast, Alaska Coastal Rainforest Ctr, 11066 Auke Lake Way, Juneau, AK 99801 USA.",john.harley@alaska.edu,,,National Marine Fisheries Service Saltonstall-Kennedy Grant [NA17NMF4270238]; Central Council of Tlingit and Haida Indian Tribes of Alaska; Chilkoot Indian Association; Craig Tribal Association; Hoonah Indian Association; Hydaburg Cooperative Association; Ketchikan Indian Community; Klawock Cooperative Association; Kodiak Area Native Association; Metlakatla Indian Community; Organized Village of Kake; Organized Village of Kasaan; Petersburg Indian Association; Skagway Traditional Council; Sitka Tribe of Alaska; Sun'aq Tribe of Kodiak; Wrangell Cooperative Association; Yakutat Tlingit Tribe,"Funding for this work was provided by a National Marine Fisheries Service Saltonstall-Kennedy Grant (Award NA17NMF4270238).

The windblown dust emission algorithm was the Air Force Weather Agency model. In comparison with ground-based PM10 observations, the model unevenly reproduces the dust-storm events. The model adequately estimates the location and timing of the events, but it is unable to precisely replicate the magnitude and timing of the elevated hourly concentrations of particles 10 mu m and smaller ([PM10]).Furthermore, the model underestimated [PM10] in highly agricultural Pinal County because it underestimated surface wind speeds and because the model's erodible fractions of the land surface data were too coarse to effectively resolve the active and abandoned agricultural lands. In contrast, the model overestimated [PM10] in western Arizona along the Colorado River because it generated daytime sea breezes (from the nearby Gulf of California) for which the surface-layer speeds were too strong. In Phoenix, AZ, the model's performance depended on the event, with both under- and overestimations partly due to incorrect representation of urban features. Sensitivity tests indicate that [PM10] highly relies on meteorological forcing. Increasing the fraction of erodible surfaces in the Pinal County agricultural areas improved the simulation of [PM10] in that region. Both 24-hr and 1-hr measured [PM10] were, for the most part, and especially in Pinal County, extremely elevated, with the former exceeding the health standard by as much as 10-fold and the latter exceeding health-based guidelines by as much as 70-fold. Monsoonal thunderstorms not only produce elevated [PM10], but also cause urban flash floods and disrupt water resource deliveries. Given the severity and frequency of these dust storms, and conceding that the modeling system applied in this work did not produce the desired agreement between simulations and observations, additional research in both the windblown dust emissions model and the weather research/physicochemical model is called for.Implications: While many dust storms can be considered to be natural, in semi-arid climates such storms often have an anthropogenic component in their sources of dust. Applying the natural, exceptional events policy to these storms with strong signatures of anthropogenic sources would appear not only to be misguided but also to stifle genuine regulatory efforts at remediation. Those dust storms that have resulted, in part, from passage over abandoned farm land should no longer be considered natural; policymakers and lawmakers need to compel the owners of such land to reduce its potential for windblown dust.","[Hyde, Peter] Arizona State Univ, Sch Engn Matter Transport & Energy, POB 876106, Tempe, AZ 85287 USA; [Mahalov, Alex] Arizona State Univ, Sch Math & Stat Sci, Tempe, AZ USA; [Mahalov, Alex; Li, Jialun] Arizona State Univ, Julie Ann Wrigley Global Inst Sustainabil, Tempe, AZ USA",,"Hyde, P (corresponding author), Arizona State Univ, Sch Engn Matter Transport & Energy, POB 876106, Tempe, AZ 85287 USA.",Peter.Hyde@asu.edu,,,National Science Foundation (NSF)National Science Foundation (NSF) [DMS 1419593]; U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA)United States Department of Agriculture (USDA) [NIFA 2015-67003-23508]; NSF Sustainable Research Network grant [CBET 1444758]; Division Of Mathematical SciencesNational Science Foundation (NSF)NSF - Directorate for Mathematical & Physical Sciences (MPS) [1419593] Funding Source: National Science Foundation,"The authors thank JoshDeZeeuw of the Pinal County Air Quality Control District, Arizona, for providing hourly [PM<INF>10</INF>] and Joe Paul and staff of the Arizona Department of Environmental Quality for some of the dust storm narratives of Table 1.

Ensemble precipitation forecasts can take uncertainties under consideration, so they have been a research topic for improving reservoir operations. In this paper, a rainfall-runoff model, combined of a multiple linear regression model (for non-flood seasons) and the Xinanjiang model (for flood seasons), for inflow forecasts and a stochastic dynamic programming model for reservoir operations are developed in order to effectively use the ensemble precipitation forecast. To explore the best way for using the ensemble precipitation forecast, two post-processing techniques, i.e., ensemble forecast averaging (EFA) and interval value (IV), are tested. The ensemble precipitation forecast from the European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts (ECMWF) was chosen due to its high accuracy, and the Huanren reservoir, located in China, was used to test the newly developed models. The results show that, compared with the traditional rule curve, hydropower generation increases by 4.86% and 4.55%, respectively, when EFA and IV are used, which indicates that the use of ensemble forecasts facilitates considerable improvements in operating performance.","[Peng, Anbang] Nanjing Hydraul Res Inst, State Key Lab Hydrol Water Resources & Hydraul En, Nanjing 210029, Jiangsu, Peoples R China; [Zhang, Xiaoli] North China Univ Water Resources & Elect Power, Sch Water Conservancy, Zhengzhou, Henan, Peoples R China; [Peng, Yong; You, Fangfang] Dalian Univ Technol, Sch Hydraul Engn, Dalian, Peoples R China; [Xu, Wei] Chongqing Jiaotong Univ, Coll River & Ocean Engn, Chongqing, Peoples R China",,"Zhang, XL (corresponding author), North China Univ Water Resources & Elect Power, Sch Water Conservancy, Zhengzhou, Henan, Peoples R China.",zxl436@163.com,,,"National Key Research and Development Program of China [2017YFC0406005]; National Natural Science Foundation of ChinaNational Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC) [91547111, 51609025, 51709108]; Scientific Research Foundation for High-level Talents of North China University of Water Resources and Electric Power [201702013]","This work was supported by the National Key Research and Development Program of China (Grant No. 2017YFC0406005), the National Natural Science Foundation of China (Grant No. 91547111, 51609025, 51709108), and the Scientific Research Foundation for High-level Talents of North China University of Water Resources and Electric Power (Grant No. 201702013).",,14,7,7,0,21,IWA PUBLISHING,LONDON,"ALLIANCE HOUSE, 12 CAXTON ST, LONDON SW1H0QS, ENGLAND",1606-9749,1607-0798,,WATER SUPPLY,Water Supply,MAR,2019,19,2,,,,,588,595,,10.2166/ws.2018.105,,,8,"Engineering, Environmental; Environmental Sciences; Water Resources",Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),Engineering; Environmental Sciences & Ecology; Water Resources,HO2VF,WOS:000460773900026,,,,,2022-02-17

With the advantages of easy implementation and high flexibility, artificial neural network (ANN) has been widely employed to address the complex hydrological forecasting problem. However, the conventional ANN method often suffers from some defects in practice, like slow convergence and local minimum. In order to enhance the ANN performance, this study proposes a hybrid river flow forecasting method by integrating the novel cooperation search algorithm (CSA) into the learning process of ANN. In other words, the computational parameters of the ANN network (like threshold and linking weights) are iteratively optimized by the CSA method in the feasible state space. The proposed method is applied to the river flow data collected from two real-world hydrological stations in China. Several Quantitative indexes are chosen to compare the performance of the developed models, while the comprehensive analysis between the simulated and observed flow data are conducted. The experimental results show that in different scenarios, the hybrid method based on ANN and CSA always outperforms the control models and yields superior forecasting results during both training and testing phases. In Three Gorges Project, the presented method makes 11.10% and 5.42% improvements in the Nash-Sutcliffe efficiency and Coefficient correlation values of the standard ANN method in the testing phase. Thus, this interesting finding shows that the performance of the artificial intelligence models in river flow time series forecasting can be effectively improved by metaheuristic algorithm with outstanding global search ability.

As a case study, 12 streamflow measuring stations were selected from four different regions of New South Wales (NSW) in eastern Australia. A number of climate indices, Pacific Decadal Oscillation (PDO), Indian Ocean Dipole (IOD), El Nino Southern Oscillation (ENSO) and ENSO Modoki index (EMI), were selected as candidate predictors based on the findings of some preliminary studies. Higher predictabilities of the GEP-based models are evident from the Pearson correlation (r) values ranging between 0.57 and 0.97, which are mostly about twice the values achieved by multiple linear regression (MLR) models in the preliminary study. Performances of the developed models were assessed using standard statistical measures such as root relative squared error (RRSE), relative absolute error (RAE), root mean square error (RMSE), mean absolute error (MAE), Nash-Sutcliffe efficiency (NSE) and Pearson correlation (r) values.

Data-Driven Models (DDMs) are common approaches for streamflow prediction. DDMs try to obtain a mathematical relation between variables without any prior knowledge or assumption about the physical relation between them. Hence, these models are effective for complex process modeling. In this study, we use the Support Vector Regression (SVR) and Multiple Linear Regression (MLR) models for long-term streamflow prediction. Moreover, three approaches, Random Forest (RF), Deep Auto-Encoder (DAE), and Principle Component Analysis method (PCA) are employed as pre-processing methods and they are combined to SVR and MLR (six hybrid models produced) in order to improve the accuracy of prediction and reduce its uncertainty. Different evaluation criteria, including R-2, RMSE, NSE, P-factor, and R-factor are computed to evaluate the efficiency of the hybrid models. The results of our study on Bookan dam indicate that the DAE-SVR model, in comparison with the PCA-MLR, RF-MLR, DAE-MLR, PCA-SVR hybrid models, provides a significant improvement in the runoff prediction accuracy and the reduction of its uncertainty. DAE-SVR and RF-SVR have the highest values in NSE (0.93 and 0.87, respectively), and the lowest values in RMSE (33.85 and 43.68 MCM, respectively) for the first forecast horizon. The uncertainty analysis of the streamflow prediction shows that DAE-SVR has the best performance at the 95% confidence level due to its P-factor and R-factor values (0.9 and 0.64, respectively). Furthermore, the DAE-SVR performance is likewise better than other hybrid models in the two, three, and four months forecast horizons.","[Abbasi, Mahdi] Univ Tehran, Dept Irrigat & Reclamat Engn, Karaj, Iran; [Farokhnia, Ashkan; Bahreinimotlagh, Masoud; Roozbahani, Reza] Water Res Inst, Tehran, Iran",,"Bahreinimotlagh, M (corresponding author), Water Res Inst, Tehran, Iran.",m.abbasi@alumni.ut.ac.ir; a.farokhnia@wri.ac.ir; m.bahreini@wri.ac.ir; r.roozbahani@wri.ac.ir,,"Abbasi, Mahdi/0000-0002-9504-9426; Bahreinimotlagh, Masoud/0000-0001-9009-663X",Water Research Institute [1/2927],This study was funded by the Water Research Institute grant number 1/2927.,,46,10,10,13,23,ELSEVIER,AMSTERDAM,"RADARWEG 29, 1043 NX AMSTERDAM, NETHERLANDS",0022-1694,1879-2707,,J HYDROL,J.

An inter-comparison experiment was performed using meteorological inputs from different models corresponding to Hurricane Irene (2011), over three sub-basins of the Hudson River basin. The ensemble-based precipitation inputs were used as forcing in a hydrological model to retrospectively forecast hourly streamflow, with a 96-hour lead time. The inputs consisted of 73 ensemble members, namely one high-resolution ECMWF deterministic member, 51 ECMWF members and 21 NOAA/ESRL (GEFS Reforecasts v2) members. The precipitation inputs were resampled to a common grid using the bilinear resampling method that was selected upon analysing different resampling methods. The results show the advantages of forcing hydrologic forecasting systems with multi-model ensemble forecasts over using deterministic and single model ensemble forecasts. The work showed that using the median of all 73 ensemble streamflow forecasts relatively improved the Nash-Sutcliffe Efficiency and lowered the biases across the examined sub-basins, compared with using the ensemble median from an individual model. This research contributes to the growing literature that demonstrates the promising capabilities of multi-model systems to better describe the uncertainty in streamflow predictions.","[Saleh, F.; Georgas, N.; Blumberg, A.

Can hydrodynamic and geomorphological features be used to predict the establishment of macrophyte communities at the shoreline scale? LocationsTwo large, shallow lakes, southwest France. MethodsBased on field observations (vegetation occurrence and anthropogenic modifications of the shore) and data generated by a geographic information system (wave exposure, wave-induced sediment re-suspension, slope and land cover), we defined sites and community groups using cluster and indicator species analyses. The groups were then analysed by means of a statistical classifier (Random Forest). These different steps in data treatment enabled us to characterize the importance of each physical factor in determining macrophyte occurrence and distribution. As a result, a predictive map to forecast aquatic plant distribution at the shoreline scale was obtained. ResultsAnthropogenic disturbances were less important parameters than natural physical variables in structuring the distribution of lakeshore macrophytes. Within natural factors, wave-induced sediment re-suspension and slope had the most impact; nevertheless, the presence of swimming areas seemed to have a strong impact on aquatic habitats, being correlated with the total absence of aquatic vegetation. The predictive map obtained through the model spatially defined the position and occurrence of suitable sites for the settlement of both invasive and rare and endangered species. ConclusionsIn this study, natural disturbances play a major role in structuring aquatic plant distribution over physical anthropogenic factors. The model contributes to improving knowledge on plant communities with respect to local hydrodynamic and morphological features of lakeshores. Furthermore, the model provides a predictive map as a useful tool for the management of aquatic vegetation in temperate shallow lakes.","[Bertrin, Vincent; Boutry, Sebastien; Jan, Gwilherm; Moreira, Sylvia; Ribaudo, Cristina] Irstea, UR EABX, Cestas, France; [Alard, Didier] Univ Bordeaux, INRA, UMR1202, BIOGECO, Pessac, France; [Haury, Jacques] AGROCAMPUS OUEST, UMR ESE, Dept Ecol, Rennes, France; [Ribaudo, Cristina] ENSEGID, EA Georessources & Environm 4592, Pessac, France",,"Bertrin, V (corresponding author), Irstea, UR EABX, Cestas, France.",vincent.bertrin@irstea.fr,"Boutry, Sébastien/AAC-2141-2020","Boutry, Sébastien/0000-0001-8046-585X; Alard, Didier/0000-0003-2703-908X",Office National des Forets (ONF); Agence de l'Eau Adour-Garonne (AEAG); Conseil Regional Nouvelle Aquitaine (CCRRDT); Regional Research and Development Program (PSDR),Office National des Forets (ONF); Agence de l'Eau Adour-Garonne (AEAG); Conseil Regional Nouvelle Aquitaine (CCRRDT); Regional Research and Development Program (PSDR),,61,6,6,3,31,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",1402-2001,1654-109X,,APPL VEG SCI,Appl.

Firstly, the rainfall data were arranged to display the overall patterns of rainfall volume along with its frequency as well as the temperature during Thailand's rainy seasons. This makes it possible to see the cycle of rainfall, which is too long for people to intuitively understand the nature of precipitation. One puzzling phenomenon that has made rainfall forecast elusive is the unpredictability of the haphazard nature of rainfall in Thailand. A more precise prediction would certainly result in a better control of water volume in rivers and dams for fruitful agricultural business and adequate human consumption. This can also prevent the flooding that can devastate the economy and transportation of the whole country and also tremendously improve the future water management policy in many ways. This effective prediction could also be employed elsewhere around the globe for similar benefits.

However, the suitability of NARX in modeling groundwater level dynamics in urbanized and arid aquifer systems has not been comprehensively investigated. In this study, a NARX-based modeling approach is presented to establish a robust water management tool to aid urban water managers in controlling the development of shallow water tables induced by artificial recharge activity. Temperature data series are used as exogenous inputs for the NARX network, as they better reflect the intensity of artificial recharge activities, such as excessive lawns irrigation. Input delays and feedback delays for the NARX networks are determined based on the autocorrelation and cross-correlation analyses of detrended groundwater levels and monthly temperature averages. The validation of the proposed approach is assessed through a rolling validation procedure. Four observation wells in Kuwait City are selected to test the applicability of the proposed approach. The results showed the superiority of the NARX-based approach in modeling groundwater levels in such an urbanized and arid aquifer system, with coefficient of determination (R-2) values ranging between 0.762 and 0.994 in the validation period. Comparison with other statistical models applied to the same study area shows that NARX models presented here reduced the mean absolute error (MAE) of groundwater levels forecasts by 50%. The findings of this paper are promising and provide a valuable tool for the urban city planner to assist in controlling the problem of shallow water tables for similar climatic and aquifer systems.","[Alsumaiei, Abdullah A.] Kuwait Univ, Coll Engn & Petr COEP, Civil Engn Dept, Khaldiya Campus,POB 5969, Safat 13060, Kuwait",,"Alsumaiei, AA (corresponding author), Kuwait Univ, Coll Engn & Petr COEP, Civil Engn Dept, Khaldiya Campus,POB 5969, Safat 13060, Kuwait.",alsumaiei.a@ku.edu.kw,,"Alsumaiei, Abdullah/0000-0002-9148-3954",Kuwait University [ZE01/19],This research was funded under Kuwait University research sector grant: ZE01/19.,,46,17,17,4,6,MDPI,BASEL,"ST ALBAN-ANLAGE 66, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND",,2073-4441,,WATER-SUI,Water,MAR,2020,12,3,,,,,,,820,10.3390/w12030820,,,16,Environmental Sciences; Water Resources,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),Environmental Sciences & Ecology; Water Resources,LI1MS,WOS:000529249500205,,gold,,,2022-02-17

Assuming favorable conditions for development of LES, determining how far inland snow bands will extend is critical to forecasters making decisions supporting the NWS watch/warning/advisory program and resulting impact-based decision support services. This research sought to identify which atmospheric parameters commonly have the greatest influence on how far inland LES bands travel, and to develop forecasting techniques to assist meteorologists. Single band LES events for the 2006-2009 winter seasons were examined downwind of Lake Ontario. The IE of LES bands was measured over the duration of each event and broken into quartiles. The quartiles were used to create categories for IE (short, moderate, and long). Several parameters were analyzed, using statistical correlations at data points within, and just outside of, LES bands. Box-and-whiskers plots were constructed for individual parameters relative to each IE category. The most strongly correlated parameters to IE included existence of a multi-lake/upstream moisture source connection (MLC), mixed-layer (ML) stability (represented by lake-air temperature differentials), 0-1-km bulk shear, and mean ML wind speed. LES bands featuring an MLC showed a greater tendency to progress farther inland, compared to those without. A predictive equation for forecasting IE of LES downwind of Lake Ontario was developed from a statistical model using a stepwise and backwards selection algorithm. A crossvalidation method was used to determine skill.","[Villani, Joseph P.] NOAA, Natl Weather Serv, Weather Forecast Off, Albany, NY USA; [Jurewicz, Michael L., Sr.] NOAA, Natl Weather Serv, Weather Forecast Off, Binghamton, NY USA; [Reinhold, Karin] SUNY Albany, Dept Math & Stat, Albany, NY 12222 USA",,"Villani, JP (corresponding author), Natl Weather Serv, 251 Fuller Rd Suite B300, Albany, NY 12203 USA.",Joe.Villani@noaa.gov,,,,,,44,12,12,0,5,NATL WEATHER ASSOC,NORMAN,"350 DAVID L BOREN BLVD, STE 2750, NORMAN, OK USA",2325-6184,,,J OPER METEOROL,J.

Because instrumentation and numerical modeling of fens is labor intensive, easy-to-apply methods that model fen distribution and their vulnerability to development are desirable. Here we demonstrate that fen areas can be simulated using existing steady-state MODFLOW models when the unsaturated zone flow (UZF) package is included. In cells where the water table is near land surface, the UZF package calculates a head difference and scaled conductance at these seepage drain cells to generate average rates of vertical seepage to the land. This formulation, which represents an alternative to blanketing the MODFLOW domain with drains, requires very little input from the user because unsaturated flow-routing is inactive and results are primarily driven by easily obtained topographic information. Like the drain approach, it has the advantage that the distribution of seepage areas is not predetermined by the modeler, but rather emerges from simulated heads. Beyond the drain approach, it takes account of intracell land surface variation to explicitly quantify multiple surficial flows corresponding to infiltration, rejected recharge, recharge and land-surface seepage. Application of the method to a basin in southeastern Wisconsin demonstrates how it can be used as a decision-support tool to first, reproduce fen distribution and, second, forecast drawdown and reduced seepage at fens in response to shallow pumping.","[Feinstein, Daniel T.] Univ Wisconsin, Upper Midwest Water Sci Ctr, US Geol Survey, Lapham Hall,Room 338,3209 North Maryland Ave, Milwaukee, WI 53211 USA; [Hart, David J.] Univ Wisconsin, Wisconsin Geol & Nat Hist Survey, 3817 Mineral Point Rd, Madison, WI 53705 USA; [Gatzke, Sarah] Nature Conservancy, Mukwonago River Watershed Off, East Troy, WI 53120 USA; [Hunt, Randall J.; Fienen, Michael N.] US Geol Survey, Upper Midwest Water Sci Ctr, 8505 Res Way, Middleton, WI 53562 USA; [Niswonger, Richard G.] US Geol Survey, Water Resources Mission Area, 345 Middlefield Rd, Menlo Pk, CA 94025 USA",,"Hart, DJ (corresponding author), Univ Wisconsin, Wisconsin Geol & Nat Hist Survey, 3817 Mineral Point Rd, Madison, WI 53705 USA.",david.hart@wisc.edu,"Fienen, Michael N/D-2479-2009","Fienen, Michael N/0000-0002-7756-4651",The Nature Conservancy; U.S. Geological SurveyUnited States Geological Survey,"We thank The Nature Conservancy for funding this work as part of its ongoing efforts to protect water resources.

It is a serious pest in southern provinces. Because climate is a limiting factor in insect distribution, we used the model CLIMEX to predict the effect of climate change on potential current and future distributions of L. invasa in China. Data were collected on the current locations of this wasp, along with the damage incurred to Eucalyptus. These data were used to create a forecast model to predict potential current and future distribution maps of L. invasa in China. RESULTS The verification results showed that 99.5% of the distribution samples formulated by the model are highly reliable and accurate. The result predicted that the potential current distribution of L. invasa will concentrate south of the Yellow River basin. The future distribution maps predicted a small-scale potential expansion north-northwest of Guangxi and more areas within China will provide increasingly suitable habitats for colonization by L. invasa. CONCLUSION These distribution predications will be useful in determining where preventive and control measures should be implemented against this pest wasp in Eucalyptus throughout China.

Although much effort has gone into producing state-of-the-art seasonal streamflow forecasts from improving IHCs and SCFs, these developments are expensive and time consuming and the forecasting skill is still limited inmost parts of the world. Hence, sensitivity analyses are crucial to funnel the resources into useful modeling and forecasting developments. It is in this context that a sensitivity analysis technique, the variational ensemble streamflow prediction assessment (VESPA) approach, was recently introduced. VESPA can be used to quantify the expected improvements in seasonal streamflow forecast skill as a result of realistic improvements in its predictability sources (i.e., the IHCs and the SCFs)-termed skill elasticity''- and to indicate where efforts should be targeted. The VESPA approach is, however, computationally expensive, relying on multiple hindcasts having varying levels of skill in IHCs and SCFs. This paper presents two approximations of the approach that are computationally inexpensive alternatives. These new methods were tested against the original VESPA results using 30 years of ensemble hindcasts for 18 catchments of the contiguous United States. The results suggest that one of themethods, end point blending, is an effective alternative for estimating the forecast skill elasticities yielded by the VESPA approach. The results also highlight the importance of the choice of verification score for a goal- oriented sensitivity analysis.","[Arnal, Louise; Stephens, Elisabeth; Cloke, Hannah L.] Univ Reading, Dept Geog & Environm Sci, Shinfield Pk, Reading, Berks, England; [Arnal, Louise; Pappenberger, Florian] European Ctr Medium Range Weather Forecasts, Shinfield Pk, Reading, Berks, England; [Wood, Andrew W.] NCAR, Res Applicat Lab, Boulder, CO USA; [Cloke, Hannah L.] Univ Reading, Dept Meteorol, Reading, Berks, England; [Pappenberger, Florian] Univ Bristol, Sch Geog Sci, Bristol, Avon, England",,"Arnal, L (corresponding author), Univ Reading, Dept Geog & Environm Sci, Shinfield Pk, Reading, Berks, England.; Arnal, L (corresponding author), European Ctr Medium Range Weather Forecasts, Shinfield Pk, Reading, Berks, England.",l.l.s.arnal@pgr.reading.ac.uk,"Pappenberger, Florian/A-2839-2009","Pappenberger, Florian/0000-0003-1766-2898; Arnal, Louise/0000-0002-0208-2324; Cloke, Hannah/0000-0002-1472-868X; Stephens, Elisabeth/0000-0002-5439-7563",Horizon IMPREX project [641811]; Leverhulme Early Career FellowshipLeverhulme Trust [ECF-2013-492]; National Science FoundationNational Science Foundation (NSF); U.S. Bureau of Reclamation [R11AC80816]; U.S. Army Corps of Engineers (USACE) Climate Preparedness and Resilience Program [1254557],"L.

Yet to accurately forecast the drought hazard on a sub-seasonal to seasonal time scale remains a challenge, and usually, meteorological drought is forecasted instead of hydrological drought, although the latter is more relevant for several impacted sectors. Therefore, we evaluate the hydro-meteorological drought forecast skill for the pan-European region using categorical drought classification method. The results show that the hydrological drought forecasts outperform the meteorological drought forecasts. Hydrological drought forecasts even show predictive power (area with perfect prediction > 50%) beyond two months ahead. Our study also concludes that dynamical forecasts, derived from seasonal forecasts, have higher predictability than ensemble streamflow predictions. The results suggest that further development of seasonal hydrological drought forecasting systems are beneficial, particularly important in the context of global warming, where drought hazard will become more frequent and severe in multiple regions in the world.","[Sutanto, Samuel J.; Van Lanen, Henny A.

Among the different techniques used for seasonal forecasting, the ensemble streamflow prediction (ESP) approach has long been employed due to the singular dependence on past meteorological records. The Swedish Meteorological and Hydrological Institute is currently extending the use of long-range forecasts within its operational warning service, which requires a thorough analysis of the suitability and applicability of different methods with the national S-HYPE hydrological model. To this end, we aim to evaluate the skill of ESP forecasts over 39 493 catchments in Sweden, understand their spatio-temporal patterns, and explore the main hydrological processes driving forecast skill. We found that ESP forecasts are generally skilful for most of the country up to 3 months into the future but that large spatio-temporal variations exist. Forecasts are most skilful during the winter months in northern Sweden, except for the highly regulated hydropower-producing rivers. The relationships between forecast skill and 15 different hydrological signatures show that forecasts are most skilful for slow-reacting, baseflow-dominated catchments and least skilful for flashy catchments. Finally, we show that forecast skill patterns can be spatially clustered in seven unique regions with similar hydrological behaviour. Overall, these results contribute to identifying in which areas and seasons and how long into the future ESP hydrological forecasts provide an added value, not only for the national forecasting and warning service, but also, most importantly, for guiding decision making in critical services such as hydropower management and risk reduction.","[Lopez, Marc Girons; Crochemore, Louise; Pechlivanidis, Ilias G.] Swedish Meteorol & Hydrol Inst, S-60176 Norrkoping, Sweden; [Crochemore, Louise] INRAE, UR Riverly, F-69100 Villeurbanne, France",,"Lopez, MG (corresponding author), Swedish Meteorol & Hydrol Inst, S-60176 Norrkoping, Sweden.",marc.girons@smhi.se,"Pechlivanidis, Ilias/AAC-6979-2019; Girons Lopez, Marc/B-7097-2015","Pechlivanidis, Ilias/0000-0002-3416-317X; Girons Lopez, Marc/0000-0002-0835-8897","Swedish Energy AgencySwedish Energy AgencyMaterials & Energy Research Center (MERC) [46412-1]; EUEuropean Commission [870497, 776787]",This work was funded by the project Longterm forecasts of wind and hydropower supply in a fluctuating climate -Importance for production planning and investments in energy storage and power transmission granted by the Swedish Energy Agency (grant no. 46412-1).

There is, however, a rich variation in responses that depends on factors such as the topographic complexity of the basin and the strength of maritime influences. We illustrate the potential effects of a strong maritime influence by studying future changes in cold season flow variability in the Fraser River Basin (FRB) of British Columbia, a large extratropical watershed extending from the Rocky Mountains to the Pacific Coast. We use a process-based hydrological model driven by an ensemble of 21 statistically down-scaled simulations from the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project Phase 5 (CMIP5), following the Representative Concentration Pathway 8.5 (RCP 8.5). Warming under RCP 8.5 leads to reduced winter snowfall, shortening the average snow accumulation season by about one-third. Despite this, large increases in cold season rainfall lead to unprecedented cold season peak flows and increased overall runoff variability in the VIC simulations. Increased cold season rainfall is shown to be the dominant climatic driver in the Coast Mountains, contributing 60 % to mean cold season runoff changes in the 2080s. Cold season runoff at the outlet of the basin increases by 70 % by the 2080s, and its interannual variability more than doubles when compared to the 1990s, suggesting substantial challenges for operational flow forecasting in the region. Furthermore, almost half of the basin (45 %) transitions from a snow-dominated runoff regime in the 1990s to a primarily rain-dominated regime in the 2080s, according to a snowmelt pulse detection algorithm. While these projections are consistent with the anticipated transition from a nival to a nival-pluvial hydrologic regime, the marked increase in FRB cold season runoff is likely linked to more frequent landfalling atmospheric rivers in the region projected in the CMIP5 models, providing in-sights for other maritime-influenced extratropical basins.","[Ul Islam, Siraj; Dery, Stephen J.] Univ Northern British Columbia, Environm Sci & Engn Program, Prince George, BC V2N 4Z9, Canada; [Curry, Charles L.; Zwiers, Francis W.] Univ Victoria, Pacific Climate Impacts Consortium, Victoria, BC V8W 2Y2, Canada",,"Ul Islam, S (corresponding author), Univ Northern British Columbia, Environm Sci & Engn Program, Prince George, BC V2N 4Z9, Canada.",sirajul.islam@unbc.ca,"Islam, Siraj Ul/Z-1665-2019",,Canadian Sea Ice and Snow Evolution (CanSISE) Network - Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada (NSERC); Mountain Water Futures (MWF) initiative of the Global Water Futures (GWF) program; Nechako Environmental Enhancement Fund (NEEF),"This work was supported by the Canadian Sea Ice and Snow Evolution (CanSISE) Network funded by the Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada (NSERC), the Mountain Water Futures (MWF) initiative of the Global Water Futures (GWF) program and the Nechako Environmental Enhancement Fund (NEEF).

To do so they rely on experience and intuition to adjust the inputs, state variables, and parameters of hydrologic models. NWS hydrologists use the term modifiers to refer collectively to these adjustments. This paper demonstrates the development and application of tools (statistical and graphical) to aid operational hydrologists in the achievement of accurate flood forecasts. Analysis of variance (ANOVA) identifies the relative contribution to forecast uncertainty of each modifier. Heat map visualizations illustrate for operational hydrologists the basin, lead-time, and season-specific effects of their modifiers choices. The tools provide operational hydrologists with insight into which of three commonly applied modifiers (precipitation, soil moisture, and unit hydrograph shape) are most likely to provide improvement in flood forecast accuracy. The tools are demonstrated for a case study of four watersheds within in the Ohio River Valley, using data for flood events sampled from 1990 to 2018. The findings of this research show that operational hydrologists in the Ohio River Basin would do well apply no modifiers in the winter (leaving hydrologic input variables and parameters at baseline values). And though the forecast might be improved by real-time adjustments to the unit hydrograph in summer months, recommendations for particular unit hydrograph modification levels cannot be made with confidence. These findings call into question the modifier adjustment program as a standard process. In the evaluated cases, modifiers do not systematically improve flood forecasts. Improvement may be more efficiently achieved through better calibration of hydrologic models or techniques for reduction of precipitation uncertainty.","[Zhu, Zhipeng; Wasti, Asphota; Ray, Patrick A.] Univ Cincinnati, Coll Engn & Appl Sci, Cincinnati, OH 45220 USA; [Schade, Trent] Natl Weather Serv, Ohio River Forecast Ctr, Wilmington, OH USA",,"Ray, PA (corresponding author), Univ Cincinnati, Coll Engn & Appl Sci, Cincinnati, OH 45220 USA.",patrick.ray@uc.edu,,"Ray, Patrick/0000-0001-9495-2317","University Corporation for Atmospheric Research: COMET Program (National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration) [NA16NWS4670042, SUBAWD000724]","This work was funded by the University Corporation for Atmospheric Research: COMET Program (National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration Prime Award Number: NA16NWS4670042, UCAR subcontract SUBAWD000724).

The experimental results of the computational intelligence techniques applications in various domains, as well as the comparative studies that were reported in the literature can be analyzed and synthesized as development strategies for new successful applications of CI algorithms. Starting from an application domain-oriented survey of selected recently reported research work, the paper presents a general benchmarking framework applicable to computational intelligence algorithms and a set of guidelines for the selection of the best or more suitable CI algorithm for solving forecasting problems. Our approach proposes the integration of software and knowledge engineering best practice towards CI benchmarking, being a computational intelligence engineering methodology. The framework uses two knowledge bases, one for the application domain and one for the CI algorithms, providing heuristic knowledge for a more informed and efficient benchmarking, a case base in which solved problems are recorded with their solution and lessons that were learned, and a knowledge-based problem instance features selection. Some examples of how to apply the framework for problems of forecasting in seismology, environmental protection, hydrology and energy are also discussed. We point out that the framework might be implemented as a software tool (e.g. a decision support system) or as a tool suite. The main conclusion of our research work is that the integration of the derived knowledge from an application domain-oriented survey into the general benchmarking framework along with the set of guidelines for best or proper CI algorithms selection can improve significantly the forecasting accuracy and the response time, in case of real time forecasters.

Future climate projections can be used to estimate how the hydrologic cycle may change, but the coarse resolution of global climate models (GCMs) (>1 degrees) makes it difficult to evaluate regional changes, such as over a single watershed. To estimate changes in hydroclimatic variables at finer spatial resolutions, we dynamically downscale the Community Climate System Model version 4 (CCSM4) with the Weather Research and Forecasting (WRF) regional climate model over the western United States at 9 km spatial resolution. By running WRF at a higher spatial resolution, we estimate future climate conditions, including 99% event magnitude, over 17 watersheds: the Columbia, Lower Colorado, Upper Colorado, the Upper Missouri/Yellowstone, and 12 basins draining the western slope of the Sierra Nevada in California. Over each basin, we compare a historical period (1996-2005) with mid-century (2041-2050) and end-century (2091-2100). From the WRF/CCSM simulations, most basins are projected to have earlier peaks in springtime streamflow. The Columbia and the Lower Colorado watersheds are both expected to experience more extreme wet days, with the 99th percentile of daily precipitation estimated to increase by over 10%. For the Upper Colorado, however, the 99th percentile of daily runoff is projected to decrease by over 30%. Basins in the northern and central Sierra Nevada are projected to have substantial increases in extreme runoff, with doubling of high flow event magnitude possible for some basins. By end-century, the contribution of high-magnitude runoff (>90th percentile) to total runoff is projected to increase from 46 to 56%, when averaged across all 12 Sierra Nevada basins.

The model consists of wavelet decomposition, a particle swarm optimization support vector machine (PSO-SVM), and an artificial bee colony algorithm-optimized BP neural network (ABC-BP). First, the wavelet decomposition method is used to decompose the non-stationary precipitation time series into multiple decomposition terms with different frequencies. Second, the high-frequency component is predicted and verified by a PSO-SVM, while the low-frequency component is predicted and verified by the ABC-BP. Thirdly, the prediction results of the high- and low-frequency components are superimposed to obtain the final prediction result. The validity of the WDPRM is verified by using precipitation data from the Wujiang River Basin in Guizhou Province from 1961 to 2018. Compared to single prediction methods using BP or PSO, the WDPRM has the advantages of low mean absolute percentage error (MAPE) and root mean square error (RMSE), high alpha and Omega, and higher prediction accuracy. The precipitation forecast, and drought assessment for the next 10 years (2019-2028), have been completed.

The system provides daily 120 h weather forecasts focusing on Greece (4 km horizontal resolution) and hydrological forecasts for the Spercheios and Evrotas rivers in Greece (100 m horizontal resolution), also providing flash flood inundation forecasts when needed (5 m horizontal resolution). The main aim of this study is to evaluate precipitation forecasts produced in a 4-year period (September 2015-August 2019) using measurements from meteorological stations across Greece. Water level forecasts for the Evrotas and Spercheios rivers were also evaluated using measurements from hydrological stations operated by the IMBRIW. Moreover, the forecast skill of the chained meteorological-hydrological-hydraulic operation of the system was investigated during a catastrophic flash flood in the Evrotas river. The results indicated that the system provided skillful precipitation and water level forecasts. The best evaluation results were yielded during rainy periods. They also demonstrated that timely flash flood forecasting products could benefit flood warning and emergency responses due to their efficiency and increased lead time.","[Varlas, George; Papadopoulos, Anastasios; Papaioannou, George; Dimitriou, Elias] Hellen Ctr Marine Res, Inst Marine Biol Resources & Inland Waters, Attica 19013, Greece",,"Varlas, G (corresponding author), Hellen Ctr Marine Res, Inst Marine Biol Resources & Inland Waters, Attica 19013, Greece.",gvarlas@hcmr.gr; tpapa@hcmr.gr; gpapaioan@hcmr.gr; elias@hcmr.gr,"Papadopoulos, Anastasios/L-6578-2013; Varlas, George/L-8082-2019; Papaioannou, George/K-2683-2019; Dimitriou, Elias/H-4237-2011","Papadopoulos, Anastasios/0000-0002-4441-3443; Varlas, George/0000-0001-7929-9452; Papaioannou, George/0000-0002-7389-6640; Dimitriou, Elias/0000-0001-6669-6897",Greek Research and Technology Network (GRNET) [PR007018/HYMETGRID-3],"Several of the calibration simulations of this work have been performed using computational time granted by the Greek Research and Technology Network (GRNET) in the National High-Performance Computer (HPC) facility ARIS (https://hpc.grnet.gr/(accessed on 12 July 2021)), under project PR007018/HYMETGRID-3.

The research results show that the IFAS model can accurately simulate the runoff process in the Tokachi River basin.

J,"Snieder, E; Abogadil, K; Khan, UT",,,,"Snieder, Everett; Abogadil, Karen; Khan, Usman T.",,,Resampling and ensemble techniques for improving ANN-based high-flow forecast accuracy,y,HYDROLOGY AND EARTH SYSTEM SCIENCES,,,English,Article,,,,,,,ARTIFICIAL NEURAL-NETWORKS; PREDICTION; MODELS; EFFICIENCY; SELECTION; ERROR; ADABOOST.RT; PERFORMANCE; VARIABLES; BASINS,"Data-driven flow-forecasting models, such as artificial neural networks (ANNs), are increasingly featured in research for their potential use in operational riverine flood warning systems. However, the distributions of observed flow data are imbalanced, resulting in poor prediction accuracy on high flows in terms of both amplitude and timing error. Resampling and ensemble techniques have been shown to improve model performance on imbalanced datasets. However, the efficacy of these methods (individually or combined) has not been explicitly evaluated for improving high-flow forecasts. In this research, we systematically evaluate and compare three resampling methods, random undersampling (RUS), random oversampling (ROS), and the synthetic minority oversampling technique for regression (SMOTER), and four ensemble techniques, randomised weights and biases, bagging, adaptive boosting (Ad-aBoost), and least-squares boosting (LSBoost), on their ability to improve high stage prediction accuracy using ANNs. These methods are implemented both independently and in combined hybrid techniques, where the resampling methods are embedded within the ensemble methods. This systematic approach for embedding resampling methods is a novel contribution. This research presents the first analysis of the effects of combining these methods on high stage prediction accuracy. Data from two Canadian watersheds (the Bow River in Alberta and the Don River in Ontario), representing distinct hydrological systems, are used as the basis for the comparison of the methods. The models are evaluated on overall performance and on typical and high stage subsets. The results of this research indicate that resampling produces marginal improvements to high stage prediction accuracy, whereas ensemble methods produce more substantial improvements, with or without resampling. Many of the techniques used produced an asymmetric trade-off between typical and high stage performance; reduction of high stage error resulted in disproportionately larger error on a typical stage. The methods proposed in this study highlight the diversity-in-learning concept and help support future studies on adapting ensemble algorithms for resampling. This research contains many of the first instances of such methods for flow forecasting and, moreover, their efficacy in addressing the imbalance problem and heteroscedasticity, which are commonly observed in high-flow and flood-forecasting models.","[Snieder, Everett; Abogadil, Karen; Khan, Usman T.] York Univ, Dept Civil Engn, 4700 Keele St, Toronto, ON M3J 1P3, Canada",,"Khan, UT (corresponding author), York Univ, Dept Civil Engn, 4700 Keele St, Toronto, ON M3J 1P3, Canada.",usman.khan@lassonde.yorku.ca,,"Snieder, Everett/0000-0003-4997-3404",Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of CanadaNatural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada (NSERC)CGIAR [RGPIN-2017-05661],This research has been supported by the Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada (grant no.

The enhanced HBV model generated ensemble hydrographs and an average stream-flow simulation. The proposed approach was developed to examine the possibility of using data (e.g., precipitation and soil moisture) from the European Organisation for the Exploitation of Meteorological Satellites (EUMETSAT) Satellite Application Facility for Support to Operational Hydrology and Water Management (H-SAF), and to explore its usefulness in improving model updating and forecasting. Data from the Sola mountain catchment in southern Poland between 1 January 2008 and 31 July 2014 were used to calibrate the HBV model, while data from 1 August 2014 to 30 April 2015 were used for validation. A bias correction algorithm for a distribution-derived transformation method was developed by exploring generalized exponential (GE) theoretical distributions, along with gamma (GA) and Weibull (WE) distributions for the different data used in this study. When using the ensemble Kalman filter, the stochastically-generated ensemble of the model states generally induced bias in the estimation of non-linear hydrologic processes, thus influencing the accuracy of the Kalman analysis. In order to reduce the bias produced by the assimilation procedure, a post-processing bias correction (BC) procedure was coupled with the ensemble Kalman filter (EnKF), resulting in an ensemble Kalman filter with bias correction (EnKF-BC). The EnKF-BC, dynamically coupled with the HBV model for the assimilation of the satellite soil moisture observations, improved the accuracy of the simulated hydrographs significantly in the summer season, whereas, a positive effect from bias corrected (BC) satellite precipitation, as forcing data, was observed in the winter. Ensemble forecasts generated from the assimilation procedure are shown to be less uncertain. In future studies, the EnKF-BC algorithm proposed in the current study could be applied to a diverse array of practical forecasting problems (e.g., an operational assimilation of snowpack and snow water equivalent in forecasting models).","[Ciupak, Maurycy] Natl Res Inst, Inst Meteorol & Water Management, Hydrol Dept, Ul Podlesna 61, PL-01673 Warsaw, Poland; [Ozga-Zielinski, Bogdan] Natl Res Inst, Inst Meteorol & Water Management, Water Management & Engn Syst Dept, Ul Podlesna 61, PL-01673 Warsaw, Poland; [Adamowski, Jan] McGill Univ, Dept Bioresource Engn, 21 111 Lakeshore, Ste Anne de Bellevue, PQ H9X 3V9, Canada; [Deo, Ravinesh C.] Univ Southern Queensland, Inst Agr & Environm, Sch Agr Computat & Environm Sci, Toowoomba, Qld 01673, Australia; [Kochanek, Krzysztof] Polish Acad Sci, Inst Geophys, Ulica Ksiecia Janusza 64, PL-01452 Warsaw, Poland",,"Adamowski, J (corresponding author), McGill Univ, Dept Bioresource Engn, 21 111 Lakeshore, Ste Anne de Bellevue, PQ H9X 3V9, Canada.",Maurycy.Ciupak@imgw.pl; Bogdan.Ozga-Zielinski@imgw.pl; jan.adamowski@mcgill.ca; ravinesh.deo@usq.edu.au; kochanek@igf.edu.pl,"Deo, Ravinesh/F-6157-2012; Ozga-Zielinski, Bogdan/G-4447-2014","Deo, Ravinesh/0000-0002-2290-6749; Ozga-Zielinski, Bogdan/0000-0002-8702-3541",NSERC Discovery and Accelerate Grant,This research was partially funded by an NSERC Discovery and Accelerate Grant held by J.A.,,66,5,5,2,6,MDPI,BASEL,"ST ALBAN-ANLAGE 66, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND",,2073-4441,,WATER-SUI,Water,OCT,2019,11,10,,,,,,,2138,10.3390/w11102138,,,31,Environmental Sciences; Water Resources,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),Environmental Sciences & Ecology; Water Resources,JL5VD,WOS:000495598400182,,"Green Accepted, gold",,,2022-02-17

As a result of its slow and creeping nature, it is problematic to establish the onset as well as the termination of drought. Irrespective of its spatial and temporal variability, drought occurs in almost all regions. A wide range of drought studies has been conducted by many researchers over a long period of time. The damage caused by drought has a huge impact on the social, economic and agricultural sectors. Researchers have defined drought in different ways depending upon the parameters and its characteristics, and universally there is no proper definition for drought because of its complexity in nature. This review is focused mainly on various Artificial Intelligence techniques used in drought assessment, monitoring, management and forecasting. The findings from the study shows that drought prediction has become significance in the field of hydrology, Water Resources Management, sustainable agriculture, etc. by using the various AI techniques. In recent studies, AI has been used widely in analysing drought in different regions. The applications of AI techniques in the domain of drought assessing, monitoring, forecasting, etc., shows a rapid growth and that the impact of these will be increasing in future. For understanding the different concepts of drought study, it is needed to establish different system of drought management in order to monitor the different factors affecting drought and then take proper measures to mitigate the damage. Literature studies have been done to analyze the onset and other measures of drought management. Future research may be oriented towards Modeling and probabilistic analysis of climatic data for refining the drought vulnerability mapping, analysis of onset and termination, warning system and drought declaration process depending on the conditions of the region.","[Kikon, Ayilobeni; Deka, Paresh Chandra] Natl Inst Technol, Dept Water Resources & Ocean Engn, Surathkal, Karnataka, India",,"Kikon, A (corresponding author), Natl Inst Technol, Dept Water Resources & Ocean Engn, Surathkal, Karnataka, India.",ayilobeni@gmail.com,,"Kikon, Ayilobeni/0000-0003-4821-1037",,,,90,0,0,19,19,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"ONE NEW YORK PLAZA, SUITE 4600, NEW YORK, NY, UNITED STATES",1436-3240,1436-3259,,STOCH ENV RES RISK A,Stoch.

Seven factors are used as the input for the LSTM model and eight years of daily data (from 2003 to 2012) are used to train the model. Then, the model is applied to the test dataset (from 2011 to 2013) for forecasting and is evaluated using the root mean squared error (RMSE) and the coefficient of determination (R-2). The test shows the LSTM model has better accuracy compared to the support vector machine (SVM) model. Furthermore, the model is adjusted to simulate the situation where the TGD does not exist to explore the dam's impact. The experiment shows that the water level of Dongting Lake drops conspicuously every year from September to November during the TGD impounding period, and the water level increases mildly during dry seasons due to TGD replenishment. Additionally, the impact of the TGD results in a water level decline in Dongting Lake during flood peaks and a subsequent lagged rise. This research provides a tool for flood forecasting and offers a reference for TGD water regulation.","[Liang, Chen; Du, Qingyun] Wuhan Univ, Sch Resource & Environm Sci, 129 Luoyu Rd, Wuhan 430079, Hubei, Peoples R China; [Li, Hongqing] Changjiang Water Resources Protect Inst, Wuhan 430010, Hubei, Peoples R China; [Lei, Mingjun] Yangtze River Water Resources Protect Bur, Wuhan 430010, Hubei, Peoples R China; [Du, Qingyun] Wuhan Univ, Key Lab Geog Informat Syst, Minist Educ, 129 Luoyu Rd, Wuhan 430079, Hubei, Peoples R China; [Du, Qingyun] Wuhan Univ, Natl Adm Surveying Mapping & Geoinformat, Key Lab Digital Mapping & Land Informat Applicat, 129 Luoyu Rd, Wuhan 430079, Hubei, Peoples R China",,"Du, QY (corresponding author), Wuhan Univ, Sch Resource & Environm Sci, 129 Luoyu Rd, Wuhan 430079, Hubei, Peoples R China.; Du, QY (corresponding author), Wuhan Univ, Key Lab Geog Informat Syst, Minist Educ, 129 Luoyu Rd, Wuhan 430079, Hubei, Peoples R China.; Du, QY (corresponding author), Wuhan Univ, Natl Adm Surveying Mapping & Geoinformat, Key Lab Digital Mapping & Land Informat Applicat, 129 Luoyu Rd, Wuhan 430079, Hubei, Peoples R China.",chenliang90210@whu.edu.cn; hqli88@163.com; mjlei@163.com; qydu@whu.edu.cn,,,National Key Research and Development Program of China [2016YFC0803106],This research was funded by the National Key Research and Development Program of China (2016YFC0803106).,,50,17,17,15,47,MDPI,BASEL,"ST ALBAN-ANLAGE 66, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND",2073-4441,,,WATER-SUI,Water,OCT,2018,10,10,,,,,,,1389,10.3390/w10101389,,,20,Environmental Sciences; Water Resources,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),Environmental Sciences & Ecology; Water Resources,HB6UP,WOS:000451208400104,,"gold, Green Submitted",,,2022-02-17

Therefore, it is important to improve forecasts of AR occurrence and characteristics. Although prior work has examined the skill of numerical weather prediction (NWP) models in forecasting atmospheric rivers, these studies only cover several years of reforecasts from a handful of models. Here, we expand this previous work and assess the performance of 10-30 years of wintertime (November-February) AR landfall reforecasts from the control runs of nine operational weather models, obtained from the International Subseasonal to Seasonal (S2S) Project database. Model errors along the west coast of North America at leads of 1-14 days are examined in terms of AR occurrence, intensity, and landfall location. Occurrence-based skill approaches that of climatology at 14 days, while models are, on average, more skillful at shorter leads in California, Oregon, and Washington compared to British Columbia and Alaska. We also find that the average magnitude of landfall integrated water vapor transport (IVT) error stays fairly constant across lead times, although overprediction of IVT is common at later lead times. Finally, we show that northward landfall location errors are favored in California, Oregon, and Washington, although southward errors occur more often than expected from climatology. These results highlight the need for model improvements, while helping to identify factors that cause model errors.","[Nardi, Kyle M.; Barnes, Elizabeth A.] Colorado State Univ, Dept Atmospher Sci, Ft Collins, CO 80523 USA; [Ralph, F.

Concurrent with this growth, demand for seasonal drought forecasting has risen. While there is obvious synergy between these fields, S2S meteorological forecasting has typically focused on low-resolution global models, whereas the development of drought can be sensitive to the local expression of weather anomalies and their interaction with local surface properties and processes. This suggests that downscaling might play an important role in the application of meteorological S2S forecasts to skillful forecasting of drought. Here, we apply the generalized analog regression downscaling (GARD) algorithm to downscale meteorological hindcasts from the NASA Goddard Earth Observing System global S2S forecast system. Downscaled meteorological fields are then applied to drive offline simulations with the Catchment Land Surface Model to forecast U.S. Drought Monitor-style drought indicators derived from simulated surface hydrology variables. We compare the representation of drought in these downscaled hindcasts with hindcasts that are not downscaled, using the North American Land Data Assimilation System Phase 2 (NLDAS-2) dataset as an observational reference. We find that downscaling using GARD improves hindcasts of temperature and temperature anomalies but that the results for precipitation are mixed and generally small. Overall, GARD downscaling led to improved hindcast skill for total drought across the contiguous United States, and improvements were greatest for extreme (D3) and exceptional (D4) drought categories.","[Zamora, Ryan A.; Zaitchik, Benjamin F.] Johns Hopkins Univ, Baltimore, MD 21218 USA; [Rodell, Matthew; Getirana, Augusto; Kumar, Sujay; Arsenault, Kristi] NASA, Hydrol Sci Lab, Goddard Space Flight Ctr, Greenbelt, MD USA; [Arsenault, Kristi] Sci Applicat Int Corp, Mclean, VA USA; [Gutmann, Ethan] Natl Ctr Atmospher Res, POB 3000, Boulder, CO 80307 USA",,"Zamora, RA (corresponding author), Johns Hopkins Univ, Baltimore, MD 21218 USA.",ryan.zamora@jhu.edu,,,NASA's Applied Sciences Program-Water Resources Award [13-WATER13-0030]; National Science FoundationNational Science Foundation (NSF); GRACE and GRACE Follow On Science Team,This study was funded by NASA'sApplied Sciences Program-Water Resources Award 13-WATER13-0030 and the GRACE and GRACE Follow On Science Team.

While local communities are often recognised as key producers of knowledge on adaptation and resilience, their role as producers of knowledge of meteorology and flood forecasting has drawn lesser interest than their consumption of it as end users. Moreover, the opinion that has carried through to limited research on this issue has been largely that of men. This paper attempts to address such a research gap, by recording various sophisticated means deployed by local communities living in villages in transboundary Gandak River basin in Bihar, India, to forecast floods and heavy rainfall. This research documents the gendered process by which local knowledge is produced through complex interaction between fine-grained observations and official early warning systems. It also explores how communities practice knowledge innovation by making generic and centralized flood forecasting information locally applicable, through triangulation. Our research argues that 'local' should not be recognised purely for dissemination of flood early warning information but also as a place of knowledge generation on flood forecasting. Current discourse on flood forecasting needs to recognize the gendered production of meteorological and flood forecasting knowledge in local communities. Furthermore, strengthening local knowledge systems on flood forecasting can work to counterbalance the drawbacks of centralized flood early warning systems, provided gender concerns embedded in both are recognised. Based on field research, this paper concludes that production and consumption of flood forecasting knowledge needs local and scientific communities to work together for reducing knowledge gaps at both ends.","[Acharya, Amitangshu] Univ Edinburgh, Res Inst Geog & Lived Environm, Sch GeoSci, Edinburgh, Midlothian, Scotland; [Prakash, Anjal] Int Ctr Integrated Mt Dev ICIMOD, HI AWARE, Kathmandu, Nepal",,"Acharya, A (corresponding author), Univ Edinburgh, Res Inst Geog & Lived Environm, Sch GeoSci, Edinburgh, Midlothian, Scotland.",amitangshu.acharya@ed.ac.uk,,"Acharya, Amitangshu/0000-0003-2333-7936","International Development Research Centre (IDRC), Ottawa, Canada; IDRC [107641]; government of Afghanistan; government of Australia; government of Austria; government of Bangladesh; government of Bhutan; government of China; government of India; government of Myanmar; government of Nepal; government of Norway; government of Pakistan; government of Switzerland; government of United Kingdom","This work was carried out by the Himalayan Adaptation, Water and Resilience (HI-AWARE) consortium under the Collaborative Adaptation Research Initiative in Africa and Asia (CARIAA) with financial support from International Development Research Centre (IDRC), Ottawa, Canada.

Therefore, in this paper, an equal ensemble drought prediction (EEDP) model, a weighted ensemble drought prediction (WEDP) model, and a conditional ensemble drought prediction (CEDP) model were established and elaborately compared for drought prediction. The EEDP model directly uses the concept of ensemble streamflow prediction and assigns an equal weight to each ensemble member. The WEDP model assigns weights to ensemble members given the similarity of climate indexes between the historical and forecast year. The CEDP model considers the climate information as predictors and generates conditional ensembles of drought given the climate indexes. The verification of the proposed models was carried out using 26 meteorological stations in Jiangxi province (China), using the standard precipitation index to depict meteorological drought conditions in October, November, and December. The results show that compared to the EEDP model, the WEDP and CEDP models remarkably improved the accuracy and reduced the uncertainty of the drought prediction, indicating that a model considering climate information is much better than a purely statistical model. Meanwhile, the CEDP model outperformed the WEDP model in parameter estimation and accuracy. The prediction in southern Jiangxi province gets the best results compared with other regions. Our results provide a basis for drought planning and management in Jiangxi province.","[Zhang, Xu; Dong, Qianjin; Chen, Jie] Wuhan Univ, State Key Lab Water Resources & Hydropower Engn S, Wuhan 430072, Hubei, Peoples R China; [Dong, Qianjin; Chen, Jie] Wuhan Univ, Res Inst Water Secur, Wuhan 430072, Hubei, Peoples R China",,"Dong, QJ (corresponding author), Wuhan Univ, State Key Lab Water Resources & Hydropower Engn S, Wuhan 430072, Hubei, Peoples R China.; Dong, QJ (corresponding author), Wuhan Univ, Res Inst Water Secur, Wuhan 430072, Hubei, Peoples R China.",dqjin@whu.edu.cn,,"Zhang, Xu/0000-0002-0957-3636","National Key R&D Program of China [2016YFC0402708, 2017YFA0603704]; National Nature Science Foundation of ChinaNational Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC) [51439007, 91647119]; Innovation group of Hubei Natural Science Foundation [2017CFA015]","This research is financially supported by the National Key R&D Program of China (Grant Nos. 2016YFC0402708, 2017YFA0603704), National Nature Science Foundation of China (Grant Nos. 51439007, 91647119), and Innovation group of Hubei Natural Science Foundation (Grant No. 2017CFA015).

Why the Meiyu duration doubled in 2020 remains a puzzle. We show that the long-lasting Meiyu can be divided into three stages: advanced-onset, strong-persisting, and delayed-withdrawal. The advanced-onset was associated with an extremely negative-phase East Atlantic/West Russia teleconnection. The strong-persisting was attributed to a positive-phase Pacific-Japan (PJ) pattern sustained by La Nina's rapid development. The delayed withdrawal was related to the combined effect of a positive PJ pattern and a mid-troposphere two ridge-one trough pattern over Asia. Two subseasonal forecasting systems predicted the positive rainfall anomalies over the YHRV in the first two stages, but not the third stage, which may be associated with poor prediction of the two ridge-one trough pattern. These results highlight the role of subseasonal evolution in extreme climate events. Plain Language Summary During the northward advance of the East Asian summer monsoon, the East Asian subtropical region is normally characterized by a quasi-stationary rainband that persists from mid-June to mid-July, which is known as Meiyu in China and Baiu in Japan. Both the duration and the accumulated rainfall of the 2020 Meiyu set the highest record since 1961, which caused a severe flood and an enormous economic loss in the Yangtze and Huaihe River valleys (YHRV), central-eastern China. We investigated the mechanism and predictions of this long-lasting flood. The record-long 2020 Meiyu can be divided into three stages: advanced-onset, strong-persisting, and delayed withdrawal. The advanced-onset stage was mainly induced by the extratropical climate anomalies associated with the East Atlantic/West Russia teleconnection. In contrast, the strong-persisting stage was due to the enhanced tropical forcing via triggering the Pacific-Japan pattern. The delayed withdrawal stage arises from the combined effect of tropical forcing and mid-latitude teleconnection. The current advanced forecasting systems can predict the positive rainfall anomalies over the YHRV in the first two stages, but not the third stage. These findings advance our understanding of the extreme 2020 flood and help improve future extreme monsoon prediction. Key Points The long-lasting 2020 Meiyu season was characterized by three stages: advanced-onset, strong-persisting, and delayed withdrawal The mid-latitude teleconnection played a crucial role in the 2020 Meiyu onset and withdrawal, while tropical forcing's role is enhanced in the last two stages Advanced forecasting systems cannot predict the delayed withdrawal due to the failure in predicting the mid-latitude teleconnection","[Qiao, Shaobo; Cheung, Ho-Nam; Liu, Fei; Dong, Wenjie] Sun Yat Sen Univ, Sch Atmospher Sci, Zhuhai, Peoples R China; [Qiao, Shaobo; Cheung, Ho-Nam; Liu, Fei; Dong, Wenjie] Sun Yat Sen Univ, Minist Educ, Key Lab Trop Atmosphere Ocean Syst, Zhuhai, Peoples R China; [Qiao, Shaobo; Cheung, Ho-Nam; Liu, Fei; Feng, Guolin; Dong, Wenjie] Southern Marine Sci & Engn Guangdong Lab, Zhuhai, Peoples R China; [Chen, Dong; Zhang, Zengping; Feng, Guolin] Yangzhou Univ, Sch Phys Sci & Technol, Yangzhou, Jiangsu, Peoples R China; [Wang, Bin] Univ Hawaii Manoa, Dept Atmospher Sci, Honolulu, HI 96822 USA; [Wang, Bin] Univ Hawaii Manoa, Int Pacific Res Ctr, Honolulu, HI 96822 USA; [Cheng, Jianbo] Yancheng Inst Technol, Sch Environm Sci & Engn, Yancheng, Peoples R China; [Tang, Shankai] Lanzhou Univ, Sch Atmospher Sci, Lanzhou, Peoples R China; [Feng, Guolin] China Meteorol Adm, Lab Climate Studies, Natl Climate Ctr, Beijing, Peoples R China",,"Feng, GL (corresponding author), Southern Marine Sci & Engn Guangdong Lab, Zhuhai, Peoples R China.; Feng, GL (corresponding author), Yangzhou Univ, Sch Phys Sci & Technol, Yangzhou, Jiangsu, Peoples R China.; Feng, GL (corresponding author), China Meteorol Adm, Lab Climate Studies, Natl Climate Ctr, Beijing, Peoples R China.",fenggl@cma.gov.cn,,,"National Key Research and Development Program of China [2017YFC1502300]; Key Program of the National Natural Science Foundation of ChinaNational Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC) [41530531]; National Natural Science Foundation of ChinaNational Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC) [41905057, 41905050, 41975088, 41875100]; China Postdoctoral Science FoundationChina Postdoctoral Science Foundation [2018M640848]","The authors acknowledge the support of the National Key Research and Development Program of China (2017YFC1502300), the Key Program of the National Natural Science Foundation of China (41530531), the General Program of the National Natural Science Foundation of China (41905057, 41905050, 41975088, and 41875100), and the China Postdoctoral Science Foundation funded project (2018M640848).",,51,8,8,11,12,AMER GEOPHYSICAL UNION,WASHINGTON,"2000 FLORIDA AVE NW, WASHINGTON, DC 20009 USA",0094-8276,1944-8007,,GEOPHYS RES LETT,Geophys.

In this study, we conducted a comprehensive study of scarce data that addressed both rainfall-runoff and runoff-pollutant processes, whereby the impacts of data scarcity on two commonly used methods, including Unit Hydrograph (UH) and Loads Estimator (LOADEST), were quantified. A case study was performed in a typical small catchment of the Three Gorges Reservoir Region (TGRR) of China. Based on our results, the classification of rainfall patterns should be carried out first when analyzing modeling results. Compared to data based on a missing rate and a missing location, key information generates more impacts on the simulated flow and NPS loads. When the scarcity rate exceeds a certain threshold (20% in this study), measured data scarcity level has clear impacts on the model's accuracy. As the model of total nitrogen (TN) always performs better under different data scarcity conditions, researchers are encouraged to pay more attention to continuous the monitoring of total phosphorus (TP) for better NPS-TP predictions.

Potential impacts, especially to transportation infrastructure such as roads and bridges, are magnified due to their age. Also, transportation infrastructure experiences strain to keep up with increasing land development, which causes more flow into streams. To mitigate the resulting impacts of bridge overtopping and roadway washouts on the public, a software tool is proposed that contributes to decision making in disaster response for extreme rainfall events. To create the software tool, an accurate, high resolution surface terrain model (including channels, roadways, and infrastructure for bridges and culverts) is produced of the selected study area using QL2 LiDAR data sets. Additionally, stormwater flow models are generated for flow at stream and bridge intersections, and through culverts at various storm return periods. The resulting software tool will integrate bridge overtopping and roadway washout location identification to show the severity of impact for selected watersheds in near real time. This tool will be in the form of open source software (e.g., Python) and an interactive map to display the locations and levels of severity based on forecasted rain data input for the study area.

Though numerous research studies have witnessed the improved estimate of ANN models, the practical applications are sometimes limited. The black box nature of ANN models and their parameters hardly convey the physical meaning of catchment characteristics, which result in lack of transparency. In addition, it is perceived that the point prediction provided by ANN models does not explain any information about the prediction uncertainty, which reduce the reliability. Thus, there is an increasing consensus among researchers for developing methods to quantify the uncertainty of ANN models, and a comprehensive evaluation of uncertainty methods applied in ANN models is an emerging field that calls for further improvements. In this paper, methods used for quantifying the prediction uncertainty of ANN based hydrologic models are reviewed based on the research articles published from the year 2002 to 2015, which focused on modeling streamflow forecast/prediction. While the flood forecasting along with uncertainty quantification has been frequently reported in applications other than ANN in the literature, the uncertainty quantification in ANN model is a recent progress in the field, emerged from the year 2002. Based on the review, it is found that methods for best way of incorporating various aspects of uncertainty in ANN modeling require further investigation. Though model inputs, parameters and structure uncertainty are mainly considered as the source of uncertainty, information of their mutual interaction is still lacking while estimating the total prediction uncertainty. The network topology including number of layers, nodes, activation function and training algorithm has often been optimized for the model accuracy, however not in terms of model uncertainty. Finally, the effective use of various uncertainty evaluation indices should be encouraged for the meaningful quantification of uncertainty. This review article also discusses the effectiveness and drawbacks of each method and suggests recommendations for further improvement.","[Kasiviswanathan, K.

There are many factors affecting turbidity, and its time series is non-linear, making prediction difficult. Therefore, it is necessary to carry out research on reservoir turbidity prediction methods. In this study, the Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) neural network was identified, validated and tested for the computation of turbidity in the Qingcaosha Reservoir. The model employed historical data of turbidity, water level, wind direction and wind speed over a period of 2 years at various monitoring points. Within 40 iterations of the model, the mean square error converged to less than 0.05 steadily, and the Nash efficiency coefficient of the 24 h prediction was above 0.5. It showed that the model has the characteristics of fast convergence, high stability, and accurate prediction, which meant this model can be well applied to prediction of reservoir turbidity. This study also tried to use the forecasted wind field data to improve the actual turbidity prediction of the reservoir. The results showed that the accuracy is slightly lower than the predicted result using the measured wind field data, but it was significantly higher than the prediction result using the extended wind field data at the previous time point. Therefore, using forecasted wind field data can effectively improve the accuracy of the actual reservoir turbidity forecast. The results of this study indicate that the LSTM neural network model is fast, stable, and highly accurate, indicating that it is suitable for prediction of turbidity in reservoirs and can provide support for water quality management of reservoirs.","[Song, Chenyu; Zhang, Haiping] Tongji Univ, Shanghai 200092, Peoples R China",,"Zhang, HP (corresponding author), Tongji Univ, Shanghai 200092, Peoples R China.",hpzhang@tongji.edu.cn,,,Major Science and Technology Program for Water Pollution Control and Treatment [2017ZX07207003-02]; Ministry of Housing and Urban-Rural Development of the People's of China,This research was supported by the Major Science and Technology Program for Water Pollution Control and Treatment (No. 2017ZX07207003-02) funded by Ministry of Housing and Urban-Rural Development of the People's of China.

Where one-year in advance forecasting of reservoir inflows can provide data to have an optimal reservoir operation, reports show we still need more accurate models which include all effective parameters to have more forecasting accuracy than traditional linear models (ARMA and ARIMA). Thus, hybridization of models was employed for improving the accuracy of flow forecasting. Moreover, various forecasters including large-scale climate signals were tested to promote forecasting. This paper focuses on testing MARMA-NARX hybrid model to enhance the accuracy of monthly inflow forecasts. Since the inflow in different periods of the year has in linear and non-linear trends, the hybrid model is proposed as a means of combining linear model, monthly autoregressive moving average (MARMA), and non-linear model, nonlinear autoregressive model with exogenous (NARX) inputs to upgrade the accuracy of flow forecasting.

During this period a number of SCF systems have been developed for the prediction of seasonal-to-interannual variability of rainfall and surface temperatures. Areas of highest predictability, albeit relatively modest, have also been identified. The north-eastern parts of South Africa that includes the Limpopo province has been demonstrated to be one of the areas of highest SCF skill in the country. Statistical post-processing techniques applied to global climate model output were part of this forecast system development, and were subsequently successfully used in the construction of forecasts systems for applications in sectors which are associated with ENSO-driven climate variability, such as dry-land crop yields and river flows. Here we follow a similar post-model processing approach to test SCF systems for application to the incidence of seasonal malaria in Limpopo. The malaria forecast system introduced here makes use of the seasonal rainfall output fields of one of the North American Multi-Model Ensemble (NMME) climate models, which is then linked statistically through multiple linear regression to observed malaria incidence. The verification results as calculated over a 20-year hindcast period show that the season of highest malaria incidence forecast skill is during the austral mid-summer time of December to February. Moreover, the hindcasts based on the NMME model outscore those of statistical forecast models that separately use Indian and Pacific Ocean sea-surface temperatures as predictors, thus justifying the use of physical global climate models for this kind of application. Additional results indicate that model skill levels may include quasi-decadal variability, that the periods over which forecast verification is performed strongly influences forecast skill, and that poorly predicted malaria seasons may have serious financial implications on public health operations.","[Landman, Willem A.] Univ Pretoria, Dept Geog Geoinformat & Meteorol, Pretoria, South Africa; [Sweijd, Neville] CSIR, Alliance Collaborat Climate & Earth Syst Sci, Cape Town, South Africa; [Masedi, Nyakallo] Malaria Control Program, Dept Hlth, Polokwane, Limpopo Provinc, South Africa; [Minakawa, Noboru] Nagasaki Univ, Sch Trop Med & Global Hlth, Nagasaki, Japan",,"Landman, WA (corresponding author), Univ Pretoria, Dept Geog Geoinformat & Meteorol, Pretoria, South Africa.",Willem.Landman@up.ac.za,,"Sweijd, Neville/0000-0002-6713-0171; , Noboru/0000-0003-3664-9605",Japan Agency for Medical Research and Development (AMED)Japan Agency for Medical Research and Development (AMED) [JP18jm0110007]; Japan International Cooperation Agency (JICA) through Science and Technology Research Partnership for Sustainable Development (SATREPS) project for iDEWS South Africa; NMME-Phase II system,"This research is supported by The Japan Agency for Medical Research and Development (AMED; Grant JP18jm0110007) and Japan International Cooperation Agency (JICA) through Science and Technology Research Partnership for Sustainable Development (SATREPS) project for iDEWS South Africa.

Thus, accurate and reliable predictions of coal mine water inflow and aquifer water level variations are required to ensure mining safety and assess the impact of coal mining on groundwater aquifers. A three-dimensional numerical model was established for unsteady groundwater flows based on a conceptual hydrogeologic model. The numerical simulation predicted mine water inflow via repeated parameter adjustments and model identification and verification, and the simulated water inflow values were compared with the water inflow values predicted by the hydrogeological analytical method. Similarly, the numerical simulation also forecasted the changes in the water levels of the phreatic and karst fissure aquifers. The numerical simulation predicted greater water inflow than that determined by the big well method for the 5th coal seam of Panel 1, whereas the opposite results were obtained for the water inflow estimates for the coal seams in the other two panels. The calculated combined mine water inflows for the three mined panels were 14940m(3)/day and 14774m(3)/day using the big well method and the numerical simulation, respectively. A comparative analysis of the water levels in different periods showed that the water levels slightly decreased for both the mined and unmined cases, and the maximum variation differences between the unmined and mined cases were 1.39 and 2.72m in the phreatic aquifer and karst fissure aquifer, respectively. The maximum water level decrease occurred in the northeast area of the coalfield. Based on this work, such results can be used by decision maker to improve mine safety and protect water resources.","[Wu, Chu; Wu, Xiong; Zhu, Ge; Qian, Cheng] China Univ Geosci, Sch Water Resources & Environm, Beijing 100083, Peoples R China",,"Wu, X (corresponding author), China Univ Geosci, Sch Water Resources & Environm, Beijing 100083, Peoples R China.",wuxiong@cugb.edu.cn,,,Ministry of Land and Resources of China [201511056-3]; National Natural Science Foundation of ChinaNational Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC) [41572227]; Department of Land and Resources of Anhui Province [2016-k-10],"This study was supported by a project supported by the Ministry of Land and Resources of China (201511056-3), the National Natural Science Foundation of China (no. 41572227) and a project supported by Department of Land and Resources of Anhui Province (2016-k-10).",,33,5,5,12,61,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"233 SPRING ST, NEW YORK, NY 10013 USA",1866-6280,1866-6299,,ENVIRON EARTH SCI,Environ.

Over the past few years, the water quality of rivers is adversely affected due to harmful wastes and pollutants. This ever-increasing water pollution is a big matter of concern as it deteriorating the water quality, making it unfit for any type of use. Recently, water quality modelling using machine learning techniques has generated a lot of interest and can be very beneficial in ecological and water resources management. However, they suffer many times from high computational complexity and high prediction error. The good performance of a deep neural network like long short-term memory network (LSTM) has been exploited for the time-series data. In this paper, a deep learning-based Bi-LSTM model (DLBL-WQA) is introduced to forecast the water quality factors of Yamuna River, India. The existing schemes do not perform missing value imputation and focus only on the learning process without including a loss function pertaining to training error. The proposed model shows a novel scheme which includes missing value imputation in the first phase, the second phase generates the feature maps from the given input data, the third phase includes a Bi-LSTM architecture to improve the learning process, and finally, an optimized loss function is applied to reduce the training error. Thus, the proposed model improves forecasting accuracy. Data comprising monthly samples of different water quality factors were collected for 6 years (2013-2019) at several locations in the Delhi region. Experimental results reveal that predicted values of the model and the actual values were in a close agreement and could reveal a future trend. The performance of our model was compared with various state of the art techniques like SVR, random forest, artificial neural network, LSTM, and CNN-LSTM. To check the accuracy, metrics like root mean square errors (RMSE), the mean absolute error (MAE), mean square error (MSE), and mean absolute percentage error (MAPE) have been used. Experimental analysis is carried out by measuring the COD and BOD levels. COD analysis reveals the MSE, RMSE, MAE, and MAPE values as 0.015, 0.117, 0.115, and 20.32, respectively, for the Palla region. Similarly, BOD analysis indicates the MSE, RMSE, MAE, and MAPE values as 0.107, 0.108, 0.124, and 18.22, respectively. A comparative analysis reveals that the proposed model outperforms all other models in terms of the best forecasting accuracy and lowest error rates.","[Khullar, Sakshi] Guru Gobind Singh Indraprastha Univ, New Delhi 110008, India; [Singh, Nanhey] AIACTR, GGSIPU, CSE, Krishna Nagar Rd Chacha Nahru Bal Chikitsalaya, New Delhi 110031, India",,"Khullar, S (corresponding author), Guru Gobind Singh Indraprastha Univ, New Delhi 110008, India.",sakshikhullar2809@gmail.com; nsingh1973@gmail.com,,"Singh, Prof.Nanhay/0000-0002-3303-1386",,,,31,2,2,22,52,SPRINGER HEIDELBERG,HEIDELBERG,"TIERGARTENSTRASSE 17, D-69121 HEIDELBERG, GERMANY",0944-1344,1614-7499,,ENVIRON SCI POLLUT R,Environ.

In flood season, the river should be controlled to ensure the ecological and landscape water level. In non-flood season, the water level should be lowered to ensure smooth drainage. In urban areas, the response of the river water level to rainfall and artificial regulation is relatively rapid and strong. Therefore, building a mathematical model to forecast the short-term trend of urban river water levels can provide a scientific basis for decision makers and is of great significance for the management of urban water systems. With a focus on the high uncertainty of urban river water level prediction, a real-time rolling forecast method for the short-term water levels of urban internal rivers and external rivers was constructed, based on long short-term memory (LSTM).

In this study, improved accuracy of forecasts (up to three months) of Lake Michigan and Lake Ontario WLs was achieved by coupling Boundary Corrected (BC) Maximal Overlap Discrete Wavelet Transform (MODWT) data preprocessing, with a hybrid Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) Long-Short Term Memory (LSTM) deep learning (DL) model. Hybrid DL-based model performance was compared to that of BC-MODWT machine learning (ML) [e.g., Random Forest (RF) and Support Vector Regression (SVR)] models. For each lake, all models were calibrated using 70% of the monthly WL (in meters) data series (January 1918 to February 1988), with the remaining 30% (March 1988 to December 2018) serving for validation. In both standalone and wavelet-machine learning models, a hybrid correlation-based feature selection (CFS)-particle swarm optimization (PSO) search method served to select input variables among candidate WL lags of up to twelve months, whereas for the CNN-LSTM DL models, input variable selection was carried out automatically by the CNN structure. For the MODWT-based ML and DL models, input time series were decomposed using a BC-MODWT approach. Scaling coefficients were developed through several mother wavelet approaches (i.e., Haar, Daubechies, Symlets, Fejer-Korovkin and Coiflets) with different filter lengths (up to twelve) and decomposition levels (up to seven). Model performance was evaluated using several visual and statistical metrics, including the correlation coefficient, r; the root mean standard error, RMSE; and Willmot's Index, WI. The CNN-LSTM DL model outperformed the standalone SVR and RF models. For all time horizons, coupled MODWT-based CNN-LSTM models outperformed standalone and hybrid models in WL forecasting. Not all wavelet family/filter length/decomposition combinations improved standalone models; however, the proposed BC-MODWT-CNN-LSTM model implementing the Haar mother wavelet (for Lake Michigan - one-month ahead: r = 0.994, RMSE = 0.04 m, WI = 0.996; two-months ahead: r = 0.979, RMSE = 0.07 m, WI = 0.989; threemonths ahead: r = 0.957, RMSE = 0.102 m, WI = 0.976; for Lake Ontario - one-month ahead: r = 0.956, RMSE = 0.082 m, WI = 0.978; two-months ahead: r = 0.864, RMSE = 0.141, WI = 0.912; three-months ahead: r = 0.755, RMSE = 0.182 m, WI = 0.841) outperformed standalone ML and BC-MODWT-ML-based models. Accordingly, the BC-MODWT-CNN-LSTM model can be viewed as a potentially useful approach to increase the accuracy of lake WL forecasts.","[Barzegar, Rahim; Aalami, Mohammad Taghi] Univ Tabriz, Fac Civil Engn, 29 Bahman Blvd, Tabriz 5166616471, Iran; [Barzegar, Rahim; Adamowski, Jan] McGill Univ, Dept Bioresource Engn, 21111 Lakeshore, Ste Anne De Bellevue, PQ H9X 3V9, Canada",,"Barzegar, R (corresponding author), Univ Tabriz, Fac Civil Engn, 29 Bahman Blvd, Tabriz 5166616471, Iran.",rm.barzegar@tabrizu.ac.ir,,,"University of Tabriz, Iran [5979]; NSERCNatural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada (NSERC)","The authors are thankful to the University of Tabriz, Iran for providing a Postdoctoral Research Grant (NO. 5979) to Rahim Barzegar.

This model yields high classification performance against variation in aqua pond water quality parameters and also provides the status of pond water continuously along with a remedy to keep up the water quality.","[Palani, Suryasankar Ramalakshmi; Balasubramaniyan, Kannapiran; Durairaj, Devaraj] Kalasalingam Accademy Res & Educ, Sch Elect & Elect Engn, Srivilliputtur, Tamil Nadu, India",,"Palani, SR (corresponding author), Kalasalingam Accademy Res & Educ, Sch Elect & Elect Engn, Srivilliputtur, Tamil Nadu, India.",rpssr20jan76@gmail.com,,,,,,29,1,1,1,1,SPRINGER HEIDELBERG,HEIDELBERG,"TIERGARTENSTRASSE 17, D-69121 HEIDELBERG, GERMANY",0944-1344,1614-7499,,ENVIRON SCI POLLUT R,Environ.

Despite improvements in ocean models, dynamical processes involving multiscale interactions remain poorly represented, leading to errors in forecasts. We present recent advances in understanding, quantifying, and representing physical and numerical sources of uncertainty in novel regional and global ocean ensembles at different horizontal resolutions. At coarse resolution, uncertainty in 21st century projections of the upper overturning cell in the Atlantic is mostly a result of buoyancy fluxes, while the uncertainty in projections of the bottom cell is driven equally by both wind and buoyancy flux uncertainty. In addition, freshwater and heat fluxes are the largest contributors to Atlantic Ocean heat content regional projections and their uncertainties, mostly as a result of uncertain ocean circulation projections. At both coarse and eddy-permitting resolutions, unresolved stochastic temperature and salinity fluctuations can lead to significant changes in large-scale density across the Gulf Stream front, therefore leading to major changes in large-scale transport. These perturbations can have an impact on the ensemble spread on monthly time-scales and subsequently interact nonlinearly with the dynamics of the flow, generating chaotic variability on multiannual time-scales. In the Gulf Stream region, the ratio of chaotic variability to atmospheric-forced variability in meridional heat transport is larger than 50% on time-scales shorter than 2 years, while between 40 and 48 degrees S the ratio exceeds 50% on on time-scales up to 28 years. Based on these simulations, we show that air-sea interaction and ocean subgrid eddies remain an important source of error for simulating and predicting ocean circulation, sea level, and heat uptake on a range of spatial and temporal scales. We discuss how further refinement of these ensembles can help us assess the relative importance of oceanic versus atmospheric uncertainty in weather and climate.","[Zanna, L.; Huber, M.] Univ Oxford, Atmospher Ocean & Planetary Phys, Dept Phys, Parks Rd, Oxford OX1 3PU, England; [Brankart, J.

Previous work in aquatic ecosystems has used climate data at large scales and chemistry data at small scales; the consequence of using these different data types has not been evaluated. This study combines a survey of macrophyte diversity and water chemistry measurements at a large regional scale to demonstrate the feasibility and necessity of including ecological measurements, in addition to climate data, in species distribution models of aquatic macrophytes. A survey of 740 water bodies stratified across 327,000 square kilometers was conducted to document Characeae (green macroalgae) species occurrence and water chemistry data. Chemistry variables and climate data were used separately and in concert to develop species distribution models for ten species across the study area. The impacts of future environmental changes on species distributions were modeled using a range of global climate models (GCMs), representative concentration pathways (RCPs), and pollution scenarios. Models developed with chemistry variables generally gave the most accurate predictions of species distributions when compared with those using climate variables. Calcium and conductivity had the highest total relative contribution to models across all species. Habitat changes were most pronounced in scenarios with increased road salt and deicer influences, with two species predicted to increase in range by >50% and four species predicted to decrease in range by >50%. Species of Characeae have distinct habitat ranges that closely follow spatial patterns of water chemistry. Species distribution models built with climate data alone were insufficient to predict changes in distributions in the study area. The development and implementation of standardized, large-scale water chemistry databases will aid predictions of habitat changes for aquatic ecosystems.","[Sleith, Robin S.; Karol, Kenneth G.] New York Bot Garden, Lewis B & Dorothy Cullman Program Mol Systemat, Bronx, NY 10458 USA; [Wehr, John D.] Fordham Univ, Dept Biol Sci, Bronx, NY 10458 USA",,"Sleith, RS (corresponding author), New York Bot Garden, Lewis B & Dorothy Cullman Program Mol Systemat, Bronx, NY 10458 USA.",rsleith@nybg.org,,,"Northeast Algal Society; Northeast Aquatic Plant Management Society; International Phycological Society; Phycological Society of America; Sarah K.

Therefore, in this study, we trained and tested the performance of several evolutionary algorithms, including Fire-Fly Algorithm(FFA), Genetic Algorithm (GA), Grey Wolf Optimization (GWO), Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO), and Differential Evolution (DE) hybridized with ANFIS. Three forecast horizons, short-term (Daily), mid-term (Weekly and Monthly) and long-term (Annual) with fifteen input-output combinations, a total of 90 models, were developed and tested. A Monte Carlo Simulation (MCS) framework is used for uncertainty analysis. Daily inflow to the Karun III dam, located in the southeast of Iran, for the period of June 2005 to December 2016 were used. Results indicated that: 1) All developed hybrid algorithms significantly outperformed the traditional ANFIS model performance for all prediction horizons.

This paper deals with the modeling of the run-of-river hydropower production based on climate variables on the European scale. A better understanding of future run-of-river generation patterns has important implications for power systems with increasing shares of solar and wind power. Run-of-river plants are less intermittent than solar or wind but also less dispatchable than dams with storage capacity. However, translating time series of climate data (precipitation and air temperature) into time series of run-of-river-based hydropower generation is not an easy task as it is necessary to capture the complex relationship between the availability of water and the generation of electricity. This task is also more complex when performed for a large interconnected area. In this work, a model is built for several European countries by using machine learning techniques. In particular, we compare the accuracy of models based on the Random Forest algorithm and show that a more accurate model is obtained when a finer spatial resolution of climate data is introduced. We then discuss the practical applicability of a machine learning model for the medium term forecasts and show that some very context specific but influential events are hard to capture.","[Sessa, Valentina; Assoumou, Edi] MINES Paris Tech, Ctr Mathemat Appl CMA, F-06560 Paris, France; [Bossy, Mireille] Univ Cote dAzur, CNRS, INRIA, F-06560 Valbonne, France; [Simoes, Sofia G.] IP Estrada Portela, LNEG Lab Nacl Energia Geol, Bairro Zambujal Ap 7586, P-2610999 Amadora, Portugal",,"Sessa, V (corresponding author), MINES Paris Tech, Ctr Mathemat Appl CMA, F-06560 Paris, France.",valentina.sessa@mines-paristech.fr; edi.assoumou@mines-paristech.fr; mireille.bossy@inria.fr; sofia.simoes@lneg.pt,"Bossy, Mireille/AAA-3670-2020","Bossy, Mireille/0000-0002-6972-9022",Europen Clim2power project; FORMASSwedish Research Council Formas; DLRHelmholtz AssociationGerman Aerospace Centre (DLR); BMWFW; FCTPortuguese Foundation for Science and TechnologyEuropean Commission; EPAUnited States Environmental Protection Agency; ANRFrench National Research Agency (ANR); European UnionEuropean Commission [690462];  [CLIM2POWER],"This research was supported by the Europen Clim2power project.

However, credible and reliable predicting results are hard to achieve even to extensively applied artificial intelligence (AI) models considering the uncontrollable error, indefinite inputs and unneglectable uncertainty during the modelling process. The AI model ensembled with the data pretreatment technique, the input selection method, or uncertainty analysis has been successfully used to tackle this issue, whereas studies about the comprehensive deterministic and uncertainty analysis of hybrid models in groundwater level forecast are rarely reported. In this study, a novel hybrid predictive model combining the variational mode decomposition (VMD) data pretreatment technique, Boruta input selection method, bootstrap based uncertainty analysis, and the extreme learning machine (ELM) model named VBELM was developed for 1-, 2- and 3-month ahead groundwater level prediction in a typical arid oasis area of northwestern China. The historical observed monthly groundwater level, precipitation and temperature data were used as inputs to train and test the model. Specifically, the VMD was used to decompose all the input-outputs into a set of intrinsic mode functions (IMFs), the Boruta method was applied to determine input variables, and the ELM was employed to forecast the value of each IMF. In order to ascertain the efficiency of the proposed VBELM model, the performance of the coupled model (VELM) hybridizing VMD with ELM algorithm and the single ELM model were estimated in comparison. The results indicate that the VBELM performed best, while the single ELM model performed the worst among the three models. Furthermore, the VBELM model presented lower uncertainty than the VELM model with more observed groundwater level values falling inside the confidence interval. In summary, the VBELM model demonstrated an excellent performance for both certainty and uncertainty analyses, and can serve as an effective tool for multi-scale groundwater level forecasting.","[Wu, Min; Feng, Qi; Wen, Xiaohu; Yin, Zhenliang; Yang, Linshan; Sheng, Danrui] Chinese Acad Sci, Northwest Inst Ecoenvironm & Resources, Key Lab Ecohydrol Inland River Basin, Lanzhou 730000, Peoples R China; [Wu, Min; Sheng, Danrui] Univ Chinese Acad Sci, Beijing 100049, Peoples R China; [Wu, Min; Feng, Qi; Wen, Xiaohu; Yin, Zhenliang; Yang, Linshan; Sheng, Danrui] Qilian Mt Ecoenvironm Res Ctr Gansu Prov, Lanzhou 730000, Peoples R China",,"Feng, Q; Wen, XH (corresponding author), Chinese Acad Sci, Northwest Inst Ecoenvironm & Resources, Key Lab Ecohydrol Inland River Basin, Lanzhou 730000, Peoples R China.; Feng, Q; Wen, XH (corresponding author), Qilian Mt Ecoenvironm Res Ctr Gansu Prov, Lanzhou 730000, Peoples R China.",wumin@nieer.ac.cn; qifeng@lzb.ac.cn; xhwen@lzb.ac.cn; yinzhenliang@lzb.ac.cn; yanglsh08@lzb.ac.cn; shengdanrui@lzb.ac.cn,"Wen, Xiaohu/AAE-3378-2021","Feng, Qi/0000-0002-5469-1738; Yin, Zhenliang/0000-0001-9050-6328; Yang, Linshan/0000-0002-6862-4106","National Key Research and Development Program, China [2017YFC0404305]; Key Research Program of Frontier Sciences, CAS [QYZDJ-SSW-DQC031]; Natural Science Foundation of Gansu province, China [18JR2RA026, 18JR3RA393]; CAS Light of West China Program","This research was funded by the National Key Research and Development Program, China (2017YFC0404305), the Key Research Program of Frontier Sciences, CAS (QYZDJ-SSW-DQC031), Natural Science Foundation of Gansu province, China (18JR2RA026, 18JR3RA393), CAS Light of West China Program.",,73,6,6,7,11,MDPI,BASEL,"ST ALBAN-ANLAGE 66, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND",,2073-4441,,WATER-SUI,Water,JAN,2021,13,2,,,,,,,139,10.3390/w13020139,,,29,Environmental Sciences; Water Resources,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),Environmental Sciences & Ecology; Water Resources,PY0YJ,WOS:000611775500001,,gold,,,2022-02-17

Implementation of protective and adaptive measures for ocean ecosystems requires a combination of ocean observations with analysis and prediction tools. These can guide assessments of the current state of ocean ecosystems, elucidate ongoing trends and shifts, and anticipate impacts of climate change and management policies. Analysis and prediction tools are defined here as ocean circulation models that are coupled to biogeochemical or ecological models. The range of potential applications for these systems is broad, ranging from reanalyses for the assessment of past and current states, and short-term and seasonal forecasts, to scenario simulations including climate change projections. The objectives of this article are to illustrate current capabilities with regard to the three types of applications, and to discuss the challenges and opportunities. Representative examples of global and regional systems are described with particular emphasis on those in operational or pre-operational use. With regard to the benefits and challenges, similar considerations apply to biogeochemical and ecological prediction systems as do to physical systems. However, at present there are at least two major differences: (1) biogeochemical observation streams are much sparser than physical streams presenting a significant hinderance, and (2) biogeochemical and ecological models are largely unconstrained because of insufficient observations. Expansion of biogeochemical and ecological observation systems will allow for significant advances in the development and application of analysis and prediction tools for ocean biogeochemistry and ecosystems, with multiple societal benefits.","[Fennel, Katja] Dalhousie Univ, Dept Oceanog, Halifax, NS, Canada; [Gehlen, Marion] LSCE, UMR8212, Gif Sur Yvette, France; [Brasseur, Pierre] Univ Grenoble Alpes, Grenoble INP, CNRS, IGE,IRD, Grenoble, France; [Brown, Christopher W.; Kim, Hae-Cheol] NOAA, College Pk, MD USA; [Ciavatta, Stefano] Plymouth Marine Lab, Natl Ctr Earth Observat, Plymouth, Devon, England; [Cossarini, Gianpiero; Crise, Alessandro] Ist Nazl Oceanog & Geofis Sperimentale OGS, Trieste, Italy; [Edwards, Christopher A.] Univ Calif Santa Cruz, Ocean Sci Dept, Santa Cruz, CA 95064 USA; [Ford, David] Met Off, Exeter, Devon, England; [Friedrichs, Marjorie A.

The El Nino Southern Oscillation, North Atlantic Oscillation, and Indian Ocean Dipole indices were used as inputs. Predictability was evaluated for average summer inflows conditional on the tercile of the preceding winter climate mode. We find that the winter Nino 3.4 index was significantly positively correlated with following summer inflows to Nurek, Andijan, and Toktogul reservoirs during the period 1941-1980. Kruskal-Wallis and Kolmogorov-Smirnov tests show significant differences in the distributions of summer inflows depending on previous winter Nino 3.4 for all three reservoirs. At Nurek, summer inflows were on average 19% greater following a winter El Nino. During 1941-2016, mean summer inflows to Nurek reservoir linked to previous November-December Nino 3.4 achieved a Heidke Hit Proportion of 51-59% (compared with 33% expected by chance). Acceptable predictions of summer inflow volume were made 44% of the time. Higher inflows are explained by a south-westerly moisture flux that brings above average precipitation to Central Asia during winter El Nino conditions. Our procedure requires limited data, technical or computing resources-all considerations in data sparse, low capacity regions. Given planned developments of other large, headwater impoundments in Central Asia, early outlooks of discharge could contribute to improved dam safety, economic performance, and transboundary water sharing around such projects.","[Dixon, Samuel G.] Moors Future Partnership, Edale, Derby, England; [Wilby, Robert L.] Loughborough Univ, Dept Geog & Environm, Loughborough LE11 3TU, Leics, England",,"Wilby, RL (corresponding author), Loughborough Univ, Dept Geog & Environm, Loughborough LE11 3TU, Leics, England.",r.l.wilby@lboro.ac.uk,,,European Bank for Reconstruction and Development,"We dedicate this paper to the memory of Geoff Petts who was respectively the PhD grandfather and father to the authors.

Standardized Precipitation Index (SPI) is a rainfall-based metric that caters for different time-scales at which the drought occurs, and due to its standardization, is well-suited for forecasting drought at different periods in climatically diverse regions. This study advances drought modelling using multivariate adaptive regression splines (MARS), least square support vector machine (LSSVM), and M5Tree models by forecasting SPI in eastern Australia. MARS model incorporated rainfall as mandatory predictor with month (periodicity), Southern Oscillation Index, Pacific Decadal Oscillation Index and Indian Ocean Dipole, ENSO Modoki and Nino 3.0, 3.4 and 4.0 data added gradually. The performance was evaluated with root mean square error (RMSE), mean absolute error (MAE), and coefficient of determination (r(2)). Best MARS model required different input combinations; where rainfall, sea surface temperature and periodicity were used for all stations, but ENSO Modoki and Pacific Decadal Oscillation indices were not required for Bathurst, Collarenebri and Yamba, and the Southern Oscillation Index was not required for Collarenebri. Inclusion of periodicity increased the r(2) value by 0.5-8.1% and reduced RMSE by 3.0-178.5%. Comparisons showed that MARS superseded the performance of the other counterparts for three out of five stations with lower MAE by 15.0-73.9% and 7.3-42.2%, respectively. For the other stations, M5Tree was better than MARS/LSSVM with lower MAE by 13.8-13.4% and 25.7-52.2%, respectively, and for Bathurst, LSSVM yielded more accurate result. For droughts identified by SPI <= -0.5, accurate forecasts were attained by MARS/M5Tree for Bathurst, Yamba and Peak Hill, whereas for Collarenebri and Barraba, M5Tree was better than LSSVM/MARS. Seasonal analysis revealed disparate results where MARS/M5Tree was better than LSSVM. The results highlight the importance of periodicity in drought forecasting and also ascertains that model accuracy scales with geographic/seasonal factors due to complexity of drought and its relationship with inputs and data attributes that can affect the evolution of drought events.

Current flash flood warning techniques provide limited guidance on determining potential severity of flood impacts. Recent software updates allowing for the estimation of rainfall average recurrence intervals (ARIs) in real-time help improve the nowcasting of flash flood events, but guidance is lacking on specific ARIs to use as thresholds. Researchers at the NWS Lower Mississippi River Forecast Center collected data for 24 flash flood events across the eastern United States. Reports of flash flooding were characterized based upon relative severity, and then matched to rainfall ARIs. Preliminary results from this study suggest that utilizing the 2-yr ARI contour derived from 3-h rainfall would capture approximately 90% of flash flood reports. It also was found that more significant flash flood impacts generally became more common with an increased 3-h rainfall ARI, with major flooding of roadways or structures (>= 0.91 m, or 3 ft, of inundation) becoming likely by around a 25-yr max ARI for the storm. Because of biases in the available cases used in the analysis, results are considered preliminary and subject to considerable case-by-case variability.","[Lincoln, W.

The Yom River Basin experiences perennial droughts and floods that heavily impact the agricultural sector. In order to reduce the impact, water management, including water level estimation, must be applied to critical basins like the Yom River Basin. An important task of management is the quantitative prediction of water levels. Four different modeling approaches were applied to forecast the average monthly water level (AMWL) data from four water level measurement stations for the wet season (May-October) and dry season (November-April) from 2007 to 2020. The forecast patterns obtained from the four approaches were similar to the observed historical values, except the upstream in wet season and downstream in dry season. Furthermore, the artificial neural network (ANN) approach overestimated forecasts for almost every station in both seasons. All four approaches were more accurate in the dry season than the wet season. This study proposed a forecasting method called dynamic seasonal regression (DSR), which was obtained by combining multiple linear regression (MLR) and the autoregressive integrated moving average (ARIIVIA) model of the random error from MLR. DSR was more efficient than ANN, seasonal-ARIMA (SARIMA) and a hybridized SARIMA and ANN approach (SARIMANN). On average, for all stations in wet and dry seasons, DSR reduced RMSE by over 40.86%, 9.10% and 23.07% with respect to ANN, SARIMA and SARIMANN, and MAPE by over 35.01%, 13.02% and 15.96% with respect to ANN, SARIMA and SARIMANN. The RMSE of upstream was higher than the RMSE downstream in the wet season for all methods, and the MAPE of upstream was lower than the downstream in both seasons for all methods. Moreover, the RMSE of upstream was lower than the downstream in the dry season for all methods except the ANN method.","[Nualtong, Kitipol; Chinram, Ronnason; Khwanmuang, Piyawan; Panityakul, Thammarat] Prince Songkla Univ, Fac Sci, Div Computat Sci, Hat Yai 90110, Songkhla, Thailand; [Kirtsaeng, Sukrit] Thai Meteorol Dept, Bangkok 10260, Thailand",,"Panityakul, T (corresponding author), Prince Songkla Univ, Fac Sci, Div Computat Sci, Hat Yai 90110, Songkhla, Thailand.",thammarat.p@psu.ac.th,"Chinram, Ronnason/C-4819-2018","Chinram, Ronnason/0000-0002-6113-3689",,,,21,0,0,0,1,AMER INST MATHEMATICAL SCIENCES-AIMS,SPRINGFIELD,"PO BOX 2604, SPRINGFIELD, MO 65801-2604 USA",2372-0344,2372-0352,,AIMS ENVIRON SCI,AIMS Environ.

Integrating these features into a trait-based quantitative framework requires a conceptual and quantitative synthesis of how multiple species and their functional traits interact and respond to changing environments, a challenge known in community ecology as the fourth-corner problem. We propose such a novel synthesis, implemented as an integrated Bayesian hierarchical model. This allows us to (1) simultaneously model trait-trait and trait-environment relationships by explicitly accounting for both intra- and interspecific trait variabilities in a single analysis using all available data types, (2) quantify the strength of the trait-environment relationships, (3) identify trade-offs between multiple traits in multiple species, and (4) faithfully propagate our modeling uncertainties when making species-specific and community-wide trait predictions, reducing false confidence in our spatial prediction results. We apply this integrated approach to the world's largest mangrove forest, the Sundarbans, a sentinel ecosystem impacted simultaneously by both climate change and multiple types of human exploitation. The Sundarbans presents extensive variability in environmental variables, such as salinity and siltation, driven by changing seawater levels from the south and freshwater damming from the north. We find that tree species growing under stress have a typical functional response to the environmental drivers with inter-specific variability around this average, and the amount of variability is further contingent upon the nature and magnitude of the environmental drivers. Our model captures the retreat in traits related to resource acquisition and a plastic enhancement of traits related to resource conservation, both clear indications of stress. We predict that, if historical increases in salinity and siltation are maintained, one-third of whole-ecosystem productivity will be lost by 2050. Our integrated modeling approach bridges community and ecosystem ecology through simultaneously modeling trait-environment correlations and trait-trait trade-offs at organismal, community, and ecosystem levels; provides a generalizable foundation for powerful modeling of trait-environment linkages under changing environments to predict their consequences on ecosystem functioning and services; and is readily applicable across the Earth's ecosystems.","[Sarker, Swapan Kumar; Reeve, Richard; Matthiopoulos, Jason] Univ Glasgow, Coll Med Vet & Life Sci, Inst Biodivers Anim Hlth & Comparat Med, Boyd Orr Ctr Populat & Ecosyst Hlth, Glasgow G12 8QQ, Lanark, Scotland; [Sarker, Swapan Kumar] Shahjalal Univ Sci & Technol, Dept Forestry & Environm Sci, Sylhet 3114, Bangladesh",,"Reeve, R (corresponding author), Univ Glasgow, Coll Med Vet & Life Sci, Inst Biodivers Anim Hlth & Comparat Med, Boyd Orr Ctr Populat & Ecosyst Hlth, Glasgow G12 8QQ, Lanark, Scotland.",Richard.Reeve@glasgow.ac.uk,,"Sarker, Swapan Kumar/0000-0002-9933-0493","Commonwealth Scholarship Commission, United Kingdom [BDCA-2013-6]; SUST Research Centre, Bangladesh [FES/2020/2/01]; BBSRCUK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Biotechnology and Biological Sciences Research Council (BBSRC) [BB/L004070/1, BB/ P004202/1]; University of Glasgow start-up fund","We are thankful to the editor and reviewers for suggestions that improved this manuscript.

However, predictions by hydrological models are prone to errors due to a variety of sources of uncertainty. More accurate quantification of these uncertainties using a large number of ensembles and model runs is hampered by the high computational burden. In this study, we developed a highly efficient surrogate model constructed by sparse polynomial chaos expansion (SPCE) coupled with the least angle regression method, which enables efficient uncertainty quantifications. Polynomial chaos expansion was employed to surrogate a storage function-based hydrological model (SFM) for nine streamflow events in the Hongcheon watershed of South Korea. The efficiency of SPCE is investigated by comparing it with another surrogate model, full polynomial chaos expansion (FPCE) built by a well-known, ordinary least square regression (OLS) method. This study confirms that (1) the performance of SPCE is superior to that of FPCE because SPCE can build a more accurate surrogate model (i.e., smaller leave-one-out cross-validation error) with one-quarter the size (i.e., 500 versus 2000). (2) SPCE can sufficiently capture the uncertainty of the streamflow, which is comparable to that of SFM. (3) Sensitivity analysis attained through visual inspection and mathematical computation of the Sobol' index has been of great success for SPCE to capture the parameter sensitivity of SFM, identifying four parameters, alpha, K-bas, P-bas, and P-chn, that are most sensitive to the likelihood function, Nash-Sutcliffe efficiency. (4) The computational power of SPCE is about 200 times faster than that of SFM and about four times faster than that of FPCE. The SPCE approach builds a surrogate model quickly and robustly with a more compact experimental design compared to FPCE. Ultimately, it will benefit ensemble streamflow forecasting studies, which must provide information and alerts in real time.","[Tran, Vinh Ngoc; Kim, Jongho] Univ Ulsan, Sch Civil & Environm Engn, Ulsan 44610, South Korea",,"Kim, J (corresponding author), Univ Ulsan, Sch Civil & Environm Engn, Ulsan 44610, South Korea.",vinhtn@hus.edu.vn; kjongho@ulsan.ac.kr,,"Tran, Vinh/0000-0001-8272-4843",University of Ulsan,This work was supported by the 2018 Research Fund of University of Ulsan.,,58,1,1,4,6,MDPI,BASEL,"ST ALBAN-ANLAGE 66, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND",,2073-4441,,WATER-SUI,Water,JAN,2021,13,2,,,,,,,203,10.3390/w13020203,,,19,Environmental Sciences; Water Resources,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),Environmental Sciences & Ecology; Water Resources,PY5AP,WOS:000612057200001,,,,,2022-02-17

Therefore, this research was conducted to forecast the source of soil erosion and sedimentation rate using the Revised Universal Soil Loss Equation (RUSLE) empirical model technique in the integration of Geographic Information System (GIS). Spaceborne IFSAR with an accuracy of +/- 5 m was used and generated Digital Elevation Model (DEM) for terrain and elevation conditions. Rainfall Erosivity (R), Soil Erodibility (K), Topographic (LS), Cover Management (C), Support Practice (P) are the factors need to be included in the RUSLE's formula. The annual rainfall data of 11 rainfall stations were used in the study for modeling the R factor, an average annual amount of rainfall was collected from the year 2007 until 2017. Land use maps comprising three different years namely; 2003, 2006 and 2017 have been used to calculate the C factor and P factor. The result indicated that the rate of potential soil loss was increased by almost 94.8% between 2006 and 2017. Sediment yield was expected to be higher due to an increment of soil loss in the year 2003, 2006 and 2017. The sediment yield for Sultan Abu Bakar Dam situated at Ringlet Reservoir was indicated 349,633.99 m(3)/year in 2003, whilst 142,970.71 m(3)/year in 2006 was expected to decrease after 2003 where recorded 59% of reduction. Subsequently, the sediment yield rate was projected to increase by about 56% or 331,449.01 m(3)/year in 2017. Hence, these findings have significant implications for soil loss and sediment yield because of major land-use changes which depend on topography and rainfall factor.","[Ishak, N.

To prevent this, besides various structural measures, many non-structural solutions, such as the implementation of flood warning systems, have been proposed in recent years. In this study, we suggest a low computational cost method to produce a probabilistic flood prediction system using a single forecast precipitation scenario perturbed via a spatial shift. In fact, it is well-known that accurate forecasts of heavy precipitation, especially associated with deep moist convection, are challenging due to uncertainties arising from the numerical weather prediction (NWP), and high sensitivity to misrepresentation of the initial atmospheric state. Inaccuracies in precipitation forecasts are partially due to spatial misplacing. To produce hydro-meteorological simulations and forecasts, we use a flood forecasting system which comprises the physically-based rainfall-runoff hydrological model FEST-WB developed by the Politecnico di Milano, and the MOLOCH meteorological model provided by the Institute of Atmospheric Sciences and Climate (CNR-ISAC). The areas of study are the hydrological basins of the rivers Seveso, Olona, and Lambro located in the northern part of Milan city (northern Italy) where this system works every day in real-time. In this paper, we show the performance of reforecasts carried out between the years 2012 and 2015: in particular, we explore the Shift-Target' (ST) approach in order to obtain 40 ensemble members, which we assume equally likely, derived from the available deterministic precipitation forecast. Performances are shown through statistical indexes based on exceeding the threshold for different gauge stations over the three hydrological basins. Results highlight how the Shift-Target approach complements the deterministic MOLOCH-based flood forecast for warning purposes.","[Lombardi, Gabriele; Ceppi, Alessandro; Ravazzani, Giovanni; Mancini, Marco] Politecn Milan, Dept Civil & Environm Engn, DICA, I-20133 Milan, Italy; [Davolio, Silvio] Natl Res Council Italy, Inst Atmospher Sci & Climate, CNR ISAC, I-40129 Bologna, Italy",,"Lombardi, G (corresponding author), Politecn Milan, Dept Civil & Environm Engn, DICA, I-20133 Milan, Italy.",gabriele.lombardi@polimi.it; alessandro.ceppi@polimi.it; giovanni.ravazzani@polimi.it; s.davolio@isac.cnr.it; marco.mancini@polimi.it,"DAVOLIO, SILVIO/C-8425-2017; Ravazzani, Giovanni/A-2740-2013","DAVOLIO, SILVIO/0000-0001-8704-1814; Ravazzani, Giovanni/0000-0002-6850-0883",,,,40,2,2,0,4,MDPI,BASEL,"ST ALBAN-ANLAGE 66, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND",,2076-3263,,GEOSCIENCES,Geosciences,MAY,2018,8,5,,,,,,,181,10.3390/geosciences8050181,,,14,"Geosciences, Multidisciplinary",Emerging Sources Citation Index (ESCI),Geology,GJ3KR,WOS:000435194000036,,"gold, Green Published, Green Submitted",,,2022-02-17

This study uses hindcast data from the European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts (ECMWF) S2S forecast system to evaluate global subseasonal prediction skill of atmospheric rivers (ARs), which are intense lower tropospheric plumes of moisture transport that often project strongly onto extreme precipitation. An aggregate quantity is introduced to assess AR subseasonal prediction skill, defined as the number of AR days occurring over a week-long period (AR1wk occurrence). The observed pattern of seasonal mean AR1wk occurrence strongly resembles the general pattern of daily AR frequency. The ECMWF S2S forecast system generally shows positive (negative) biases relative to reanalysis in the mid-latitude regions in summer (winter) of up to 0.5-1.0 AR days in AR1wk occurrence in regions of highest AR activity. ECMWF AR1wk occurrence forecast skill outperforms a reference forecast based on monthly climatology of AR1wk occurrence at week-3 (14-20days) lead over a number of subtropical to midlatitude regions, with slightly better skill evident in wintertime. The magnitude and subseasonal forecast skill of AR1wk occurrence are shown to vary interannually, and both quantities are modulated during certain phases of the El Nino-Southern Oscillation, Arctic Oscillation, Pacific-North America teleconnection pattern, and Madden-Julian Oscillation.","[DeFlorio, Michael J.; Waliser, Duane E.; Guan, Bin] CALTECH, Jet Prop Lab, 4800 Oak Grove Dr M-S 300-330, Pasadena, CA 91109 USA; [Waliser, Duane E.; Guan, Bin] Univ Calif Los Angeles, Joint Inst Reg Earth Syst Sci & Engn, Los Angeles, CA USA; [Ralph, F.

As a second step a kinetic evaluation led to the selection of the most relevant parameters to be included in a novel static and dynamic model theoretical formulation. The static and dynamic models reliably described the experimental findings (bacterial inactivation under various climatic conditions) and were considered as equally eligible candidates for disinfection modeling. The final step considered ambient temperature, incident radiation and cloud-cover data to forecast (in silico) SODIS efficacy in Africa as a case study. The simulation results were compared with the experimental data and indicated that most African regions are suitable for SODIS processes, but there are areas of risk correlated with climatological conditions (cloudcover and temperature). The results of this study could be applied for regional in decision-making strategies for application of SODIS or in the search for viable alternatives to SODIS in cases where it is deemed unsuitable.","[Samoili, Sofia] European Commiss, Joint Res Ctr JRC, Seville 41092, Spain; [Farinelli, Giulio; Pulgarin, Cesar] Ecole Polytech Fed Lausanne EPFL, Inst Chem Sci & Engn ISIC, Sch Basic Sci SB, Grp Adv Oxidat Proc GPAO, Stn 6, CH-1015 Lausanne, Switzerland; [Farinelli, Giulio] Politecn Torino, Dept Environm Land & Infrastruct Engn DIATI, Corso Duca Abruzzi 24, I-10129 Turin, Italy; [Moreno-SanSegundo, Jose Angel; Marugan, Javier] Univ Rey Juan Carlos, Dept Chem & Environm Technol, ESCET, C Tulipan S-N, Madrid 28933, Spain; [McGuigan, Kevin G.] RCSI Univ Med & Healthcare, Dept Physiol & Med Phys, Dublin D02 YN77, Ireland; [Pulgarin, Cesar] Colombian Acad Exact Phys & Nat Sci, Carrera 28 A 39A-63, Bogota, Colombia; [Giannakis, Stefanos] Univ Politecn Madrid UPM, Dept Ingn Civil Hidraul Energia & Medio Ambiente, Unidad Docente Ingn Sanitaria, ETS Ingenieros Caminos Canales & Puertos, C Prof Aranguren S-N, ES-28040 Madrid, Spain",,"Giannakis, S (corresponding author), Univ Politecn Madrid UPM, Dept Ingn Civil Hidraul Energia & Medio Ambiente, Unidad Docente Ingn Sanitaria, ETS Ingenieros Caminos Canales & Puertos, C Prof Aranguren S-N, ES-28040 Madrid, Spain.",stefanos.giannakis@upm.es,"Giannakis, Stefanos/S-2537-2017; McGuigan, Kevin/A-3656-2010; Marugan, Javier/A-7370-2008","Giannakis, Stefanos/0000-0002-6982-7351; Moreno San Segundo, Jose Angel/0000-0002-7732-9088; McGuigan, Kevin/0000-0002-3775-8339; Marugan, Javier/0000-0003-1195-462X","European project WATERSPOUTT H2020-Water-5c-2015 [688928]; Swiss State Secretariat for Education, Research and Innovation (SEFRI-WATERSPOUTT) [588141]; Spanish Ministry of Science, Innovation and Universities (MICIU)Spanish Government [RYC2018-024033-I]","Cesar Pulgarin, Kevin McGuigan and Javier Marugan would like to acknowledge the financial support through the European project WATERSPOUTT H2020-Water-5c-2015 (GA 688928) and the Swiss State Secretariat for Education, Research and Innovation (SEFRI-WATERSPOUTT, No.: 588141) .

The time series decomposition has been applied to separate the different frequencies in hydrogeological and climatic data. The time series data have been decomposed into the long-term, seasonal-term, and short-term components using the Kolmogorov-Zurbenko filter. For the application of the time series regression model, we determine the lags of the hydrogeological and climatic variables that provide the maximum performance for the model. The lags applied in the predictor variables of the model have been used for the physical interpretation of the model to strengthen the relationship between the water discharge and the climatic and hydrogeological variables. The overall model accuracy has been increased up to 73%.

However, climate seasonal forecasts are often under-used, because potential users are not well aware of the capabilities and limitations of these products. This study aims at assessing the merits and caveats of a statistical empirical method, the ensemble streamflow prediction system (ESP, an ensemble based on reordering historical data) and an operational dynamical forecast system, the European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts-System 4 (S4) in predicting summer drought in Europe. Droughts are defined using the Standardized Precipitation Evapotranspiration Index for the month of August integrated over 6 months. Both systems show useful and mostly comparable deterministic skill. We argue that this source of predictability is mostly attributable to the observed initial conditions. S4 shows only higher skill in terms of ability to probabilistically identify drought occurrence. Thus, currently, both approaches provide useful information and ESP represents a computationally fast alternative to dynamical prediction applications for drought prediction.","[Turco, Marco] Univ Barcelona, Dept Appl Phys, Ave Diagonal 647, E-08028 Barcelona, Spain; [Turco, Marco; Prodhomme, Chloe; Soret, Albert; Francisco, J.

We compared the strengths of varying levels of effort (field measures, laboratory chemistry, land use, and multiple combinations of these) to explain macroinvertebrate assemblage response along a gradient of urban land use intensity among 30 headwater streams in northern West Virginia. Because the spatial arrangement of human disturbance can govern biotic response, land use effects were analyzed at five spatial scales (whole catchment, and 100 m buffer zone at three fixed upstream distances and total stream network upstream of site); instream ecological measures included physical habitat, algal concentrations and water chemistry. Of the five spatial scales, we predicted that riparian land use nearest the site would explain the most variation but that instream measures would be the overall driver of the macroinvertebrate assemblages. Regression analysis evaluated the strength of single and multiple variables in explaining macroinvertebrate multimetric index (MMI) and ordination patterns, and revealed that assemblages were highly responsive to numerous stressors. In contrast to predictions, total upstream network riparian forest cover explained the most variation overall (83%) while specific conductance was the single best instream measure (64%). Stepwise regression models using combinations of field, laboratory, and land use variables all performed reasonably well but we found that a 3-variable model [% forest (catchment), road density, and specific conductance] that minimized colinearity and cost/effort explained 90% of the variation in the MMI. Validation and spatial autocorrelation results suggest that this model could potentially be used to forecast stream condition for prioritizing conservation and remediation efforts in headwaters within the ecoregion, and our general approach would be broadly applicable in other settings.","[Pond, Gregory J.; Krock, Kelly J.

We propose and test a stochastic data-driven ensemble forecasting framework that uses archived deterministic forecasts as input and results in probabilistic water resources forecasts. In addition to input data and (ensemble) model output uncertainty, the proposed approach integrates both ensemble member selection and weighting uncertainties, using input variable selection and data-driven methods, respectively. Therefore, it does not require one to perform ensemble member selection and weighting separately. We applied the proposed forecasting framework to a previous real-world case study in Montreal, Canada, to forecast daily UWD at multiple lead times. Using wavelet-based forecasts as input data, we develop the Ensemble Wavelet-Stochastic Data-Driven Forecasting Framework, the first multiwavelet ensemble stochastic forecasting framework that produces probabilistic forecasts. For the considered case study, several variants of Ensemble Wavelet-Stochastic Data-Driven Forecasting Framework, produced using different input variable selection methods (partial correlation input selection and Edgeworth Approximations-based conditional mutual information) and data-driven models (multiple linear regression, extreme learning machines, and second-order Volterra series models), are shown to outperform wavelet- and nonwavelet-based benchmarks, especially during a heat wave (first time studied in the UWD forecasting literature).","[Quilty, John; Adamowski, Jan] McGill Univ, Dept Bioresource Engn, Montreal, PQ, Canada; [Boucher, Marie-Amelie] Univ Sherbrooke, Dept Civil & Bldg Engn, Sherbrooke, PQ, Canada",,"Quilty, J (corresponding author), McGill Univ, Dept Bioresource Engn, Montreal, PQ, Canada.",johnmquilty@gmail.com,,"Boucher, Marie-Amelie/0000-0002-4246-2444",NSERC Discovery and Accelerator grants,"We thank the City of Montreal for providing the urban water demand data used in this study.

Runoff forecasting is a time series prediction problem with a series of past runoff data (water level and discharge series data) as inputs and a fixed-length series of future runoff as output. Most previous work paid attention to the sufficiency of input data and the structural complexity of deep learning, while less effort has been put into the consideration of data quantity or the processing of original input data-such as time series decomposition, which can better capture the trend of runoff-or unleashing the effective potential of deep learning. Mutual information and seasonal trend decomposition are two useful time series methods in handling data quantity analysis and original data processing. Based on a former study, we proposed a deep learning model combined with time series analysis methods for daily runoff prediction in the middle Yangtze River and analyzed its feasibility and usability with frequently used counterpart models. Furthermore, this research also explored the data quality that affect the performance of the deep learning model. With the application of the time series method, we can effectively get some information about the data quality and data amount that we adopted in the deep learning model. The comparison experiment resulted in two different sites, implying that the proposed model improved the precision of runoff prediction and is much easier and more effective for practical application. In short, time series analysis methods can exert great potential of deep learning in daily runoff prediction and may unleash great potential of artificial intelligence in hydrology research.","[Li, Zhenghe; Ling, Kang; Zhou, Liwei] Huazhong Univ Sci & Technol, Sch Civil & Hydraul Engn, Wuhan 430074, Peoples R China; [Li, Zhenghe; Ling, Kang; Zhou, Liwei] Joint Int Water Secur Res Ctr, Wuhan 430074, Peoples R China; [Li, Zhenghe; Zhu, Modi] Georgia Inst Technol, Sch Civil & Environm Engn, Atlanta, GA 30038 USA",,"Ling, K (corresponding author), Huazhong Univ Sci & Technol, Sch Civil & Hydraul Engn, Wuhan 430074, Peoples R China.; Ling, K (corresponding author), Joint Int Water Secur Res Ctr, Wuhan 430074, Peoples R China.",lizhenghe@hust.edu.cn; kling@hust.edu.cn; zhoulw@hust.edu.cn; modizhu@gatech.edu,,"Li, Zhenghe/0000-0002-5523-5080",National Key R&D Program of China [2016YFC0402202],"This research was financially supported by the National Key R&D Program of China, grant number 2016YFC0402202.",,52,4,4,38,50,MDPI,BASEL,"ST ALBAN-ANLAGE 66, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND",,2073-4441,,WATER-SUI,Water,FEB,2021,13,4,,,,,,,575,10.3390/w13040575,,,16,Environmental Sciences; Water Resources,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),Environmental Sciences & Ecology; Water Resources,QR0DZ,WOS:000624886900001,,gold,,,2022-02-17

A distinctive feature of the system is the complete automation of the entire simulation cycle - from loading initial data to interpreting results, visualizing and alerting interested parties. The theoretical basis for ensuring the coordinated functioning of all system components is the qualimetry of models and polymodel complexes. The practical implementation is carried out using open codes, free software and GIS platform RegionView. All the complexity associated with the use of heterogeneous geographically distributed information resources is hidden from the user.

This study conducted evaluations using the 1-9 days cumulative precipitation forecast data of five typical operational global ensemble prediction systems (EPSs) from TIGGE (i.e., The Observing System Research and Predictability Experiment Interactive Grand Global Ensemble) and the observed daily precipitation data of 40 meteorological stations over the Huaihe River basin (HB). A series of verification metrics is used to evaluate the performances of quantitative precipitation forecasts (QPFs) and probabilistic quantitative precipitation forecasts (PQPFs) from the five EPSs from April to December 2015 in terms of overall performance, different precipitation thresholds, different lead times and the spatial distribution over the HB. The adaptability of the multimodel superensemble integrated from the five EPSs by the Bayesian model average is also examined during the main flood season. The results show that (1) the forecast quality of the China Meteorological Administration EPS is the worst for all lead times, which may relate to its having the fewest ensemble members. The European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts (ECMWF) EPS performs the best in terms of QPF and PQPF qualities for longer lead times because ECMWF has the largest ensemble members. (2) All EPSs have better discrimination at low thresholds, indicating the reference value for drought warnings. ECMWF is expected to obtain the best PQPF skill for a large threshold through postprocessing; (3) due to the differences in climates in the North and South of the basin, QPF and PQPF qualities are better in the northern HB than in the southern HB; (4) except for climate, the PQPF skill is also influenced by precipitation type, while the QPF accuracy is affected by terrain. The PQPF is good at forecasting the precipitation caused by ocean effects but not by mountain topography. The QPF accuracy decreases in mountainous areas; and (5) the multimodel superensemble has little effect on PQPF skill improvement but can improve QPF accuracy when raw EPSs have significantly different QPF accuracies.","[Wang, Han; Zhong, Ping-an; Zhu, Fei-lin; Lu, Qing-wen; Ma, Yu-fei; Xu, Sun-yu] Hohai Univ, Coll Hydrol & Water Resources, 1 Xikang Rd, Nanjing 210098, Peoples R China; [Zhong, Ping-an] Hohai Univ, Natl Engn Res Ctr Water Resources Efficient Utili, 1 Xikang Rd, Nanjing 210098, Peoples R China",,"Zhong, PA (corresponding author), Hohai Univ, Coll Hydrol & Water Resources, 1 Xikang Rd, Nanjing 210098, Peoples R China.; Zhong, PA (corresponding author), Hohai Univ, Natl Engn Res Ctr Water Resources Efficient Utili, 1 Xikang Rd, Nanjing 210098, Peoples R China.",wanghan_hhu@163.com; zpa_hhu@163.com; zhufeilin@hhu.edu.cn; luqw@hhu.edu.cn; mayufei@hhu.edu.cn; 3022529385@qq.com,,,"National Key Technologies R&D Program of ChinaNational Key Technology R&D Program [2017YFC0405606]; Fundamental Research Funds for the Central UniversitiesFundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities [B200202032]; China Postdoctoral Science FoundationChina Postdoctoral Science Foundation [2019M661715]; National Natural Science Foundation of China, ChinaNational Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC) [51909062]; National Natural Science Foundation of Jiangsu Province, ChinaNatural Science Foundation of Jiangsu Province [BK20180509]","This study is supported by the National Key Technologies R&D Program of China (Grant No. 2017YFC0405606), the Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities (Grant No. B200202032), the China Postdoctoral Science Foundation (Grant No. 2019M661715), National Natural Science Foundation of China, China (Grant No. 51909062), National Natural Science Foundation of Jiangsu Province, China (Grant No. BK20180509).",,64,1,1,2,11,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"ONE NEW YORK PLAZA, SUITE 4600, NEW YORK, NY, UNITED STATES",1436-3240,1436-3259,,STOCH ENV RES RISK A,Stoch.

Species distribution models may result in misrepresented projections for species living in extreme conditions if based on truncated response functions. Model extrapolation may not detect declines that could occur if future environment conditions exceeded the physiological tolerance of the species. We developed a novel method aimed to overcome this constrain by incorporating the physiological response function of a tropical hydrocoral to temperature as a predictor variable in a Hybrid SDM. Location Atlantic Ocean. Methods We conducted ecophysiological experiments simulating heat and cold stress to determine the maximum photochemical efficiency of the hydrocoral's symbiont along a thermal gradient to identify sublethal and lethal conditions. The response curve obtained was then applied to a temperature raster to create a new physio-climatic variable, which was integrated into the Hybrid SDM as a predictor. Simple Physiological and Correlative SDMs were compared with the Hybrid model. Results The Hybrid SDM outperformed the Correlative SDM allowing predictions without extrapolations in the physio-climatic predictor. It suggested habitat contractions in tropical regions with forecasted temperatures above the coral's physiological tolerance, which were underrepresented by the Correlative SDM. It also incorporated habitat suitability restrictions by other predictors of unknown physiological response by incorporating correlative information (as limitations in river mouths by low salinity). In this way, by integrating mechanistic and correlative knowledge, the Hybrid SDM also predicted a potential expansion to higher latitudes, which agreed with the recent evidence of its expansion into the subtropical Canary Islands. Main conclusion Integrating physiological knowledge into Hybrid SDMs by adding a physio-climatic predictor improves model transferability resulting in predictions of decline in future climates, which may be misrepresented by SDMs trained at present-day conditions, and therefore are advisable for early warning in conservation management.","[Rodriguez, Laura; Jose Garcia, Juan; Carreno, Francisco; Martinez, Brezo] Rey Juan Carlos Univ, Biodivers & Conservat Unit, Mostoles, Spain",,"Martinez, B (corresponding author), Rey Juan Carlos Univ, Biodivers & Conservat Unit, Mostoles, Spain.",brezo.martinez@urjc.es,"Martínez, Brezo/AAE-9825-2019; García, Laura Rodríguez/F-3084-2012; Rodríguez, Laura/ABI-1607-2020","Martínez, Brezo/0000-0002-7501-7726; García, Laura Rodríguez/0000-0002-3961-3598; Rodríguez, Laura/0000-0002-3961-3598; Carreno, Francisco/0000-0002-5040-5204","Ministerio de Ciencia e InnovacionInstituto de Salud Carlos IIISpanish GovernmentEuropean Commission [AP2012-3702, CGL2014-60193-P]; REMEDINAL 3 [P2013-MAE2719]","Ministerio de Ciencia e Innovacion, Grant/Award Number: AP2012-3702 and CGL2014-60193-P; REMEDINAL 3, Grant/Award Number: P2013-MAE2719",,81,17,17,1,19,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",1366-9516,1472-4642,,DIVERS DISTRIB,Divers.

Time series analysis and artificial neural networks are combined for the explanation and forecasting of the daily water discharge using hydrogeological and climatic variables. A low pass filter (Kolmogorov-Zurbenko filter) is applied for the decomposition of the time series into different components (long, seasonal, and short-term components). For the prediction of the water discharge time series, each component has been described by applying the multiple linear regression models (MLR), and the artificial neural network (ANN) model. The MLR retains the advantage of the physical interpretation of the water discharge time series. We prove that time series decomposition is essential before the application of any model. Also, decomposition shows that the Mohawk River is affected by multiple time scale components that contribute to the hydrologic cycle of the included watersheds. Comparison of the models proves that the application of the ANN on the decomposed time series improves the accuracy of forecasting flood events. The hybrid model which consists of time series decomposition and artificial neural network leads to a forecasting up to 96% of the explanation for the water discharge time series.","[Tsakiri, Katerina] Rider Univ, Dept Informat Syst & Supply Chain Management, Lawrenceville, NJ 08648 USA; [Marsellos, Antonios] Hofstra Univ, Dept Geol Environm & Sustainabil, Hempstead, NY 11549 USA; [Kapetanakis, Stelios] Univ Brighton, Sch Comp Engn & Math, Brighton BN2 4GJ, E Sussex, England",,"Tsakiri, K (corresponding author), Rider Univ, Dept Informat Syst & Supply Chain Management, Lawrenceville, NJ 08648 USA.",ktsakiri@rider.edu; antonios.e.marsellos@hofstra.edu; s.kapetanakis@brighton.ac.uk,,", Stelios/0000-0003-1749-7327",,,,57,30,30,2,6,MDPI,BASEL,"ST ALBAN-ANLAGE 66, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND",,2073-4441,,WATER-SUI,Water,SEP,2018,10,9,,,,,,,1158,10.3390/w10091158,,,20,Environmental Sciences; Water Resources,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),Environmental Sciences & Ecology; Water Resources,GY7UR,WOS:000448821900050,,gold,,,2022-02-17

This paper presents the analyses including an assessment of the condition of the existing hydrometric data and works related to the way in which the record was treated for flow forecasting purposes and the construction of the artificial neural network (ANN) models used for predicting the flows. The study was led based on 15-min rainfall, water surface elevation and discharge data, derived from the continuous real-time monitoring station located in the del Medio River Basin from the years 2012 to 2016. As a result, the proposed modeling approach followed two modeling methods, one employing the missing data record and the other was used a multiple imputation (MI) technique to impute the missing data and forecast flow for 1, 2 and 4 h ahead under each approach. The statistical metrics results for the two-modeling approaches, suggest the non-imputed data scenario to rule out the imputed data. This means it is recommended to further optimize the MI technique if to be used effectively to fill in the missing required days of measurements for estimating H3 gaps and afterwards to forecast the flow employing multilayer perceptron (MLP), artificial neural networks (ANNs) with 10-fold cross-validation.","[Simmonds, Jose; Ledezma, Agapito] Univ Carlos III Madrid, Dept Informat, Ave Univ 30, Leganes 28911, Spain; [Gomez, Juan A.] Univ Panama, Dept Biol Marina, Estafeta Univ,Apartado 3366, Panama City 4, Panama",,"Simmonds, J (corresponding author), Univ Carlos III Madrid, Dept Informat, Ave Univ 30, Leganes 28911, Spain.",jose.simmonds@alumnos.uc3m.es; juanay05@hotmail.com; ledezma@inf.uc3m.es,"LEDEZMA, AGAPITO ISMAEL/K-3929-2014","LEDEZMA, AGAPITO ISMAEL/0000-0002-0041-6829","Spanish MICINNSpanish Government [TRA2015-63708-R, TRA2016-78886-C3-1-R]","The authors of this experiment will like to express their appreciation to Minera Panama S.A., Environmental Department for providing the necessary data.

In 2018, three flash-flood episodes resulted in 46 casualties in the deserts of Israel and Jordan alone. This paper presents the hydrometeorological analysis and forecasting of a substantial storm (25-27 April 2018) that hit an arid desert basin (Zin, similar to 1400km(2), southern Israel) claiming 12 human lives. This paper aims to (a) spatially assess the severity of the storm, (b) quantify the timescale of the hydrological response, and (c) evaluate the available operational precipitation forecasting. Return periods of the storm's maximal rain intensities were derived locally at 1 km(2) resolution using weather radar data and a novel statistical methodology. A high-resolution grid-based hydrological model was used to study the intra-basin flash-flood magnitudes which were consistent with direct information from witnesses. The model was further used to examine the hydrological response to different forecast scenarios. A small portion of the basin (1 %-20 %) experienced extreme precipitation intensities (75- to 100-year return period), resulting in a local hydrological response of a high magnitude (10 to 50-year return period). Hillslope runoff, initiated minutes after the intense rainfall occurred, reached the streams and resulted in peak discharge within tens of minutes. Available deterministic operational precipitation forecasts poorly predicted the hydrological response in the studied basins (tens to hundreds of square kilometers) mostly due to location inaccuracy. There was no gain from assimilating radar estimates in the numerical weather prediction model. Therefore, we suggest using deterministic forecasts with caution as it might lead to fatal decision making. To cope with such errors, a novel cost-effective methodology is applied by spatially shifting the forecasted precipitation fields. In this way, flash-flood occurrences were captured in most of the subbasins, resulting in few false alarms.","[Rinat, Yair; Marra, Francesco; Armon, Moshe; Metzger, Asher; Morin, Efrat] Hebrew Univ Jerusalem, Inst Earth Sci, Jerusalem, Israel; [Marra, Francesco] Natl Res Council Italy, ISAC CNR, Inst Atmospher Sci & Climate, Bologna, Italy; [Levi, Yoav; Khain, Pavel; Vadislavsky, Elyakom] Israel Meteorol Serv, Bet Dagan, Israel; [Rosensaft, Marcelo] Geol Survey Israel, Jerusalem, Israel",,"Rinat, Y (corresponding author), Hebrew Univ Jerusalem, Inst Earth Sci, Jerusalem, Israel.",yair.rinat@mail.huji.ac.il,"Marra, Francesco/I-3520-2019","Marra, Francesco/0000-0003-0573-9202; Levi, Yoav/0000-0003-2459-2023",Israel Science FoundationIsrael Science Foundation [1069/18]; NSF-BSF grant [BSF 2016953]; Paleohydrology and Extreme Floods from the Dead Sea ICDP Core [DFG BR2208/13-1/-2],"This research has been supported by the Israel Science Foundation (grant no. 1069/18), the NSF-BSF grant (grant no.

This type of landslide has continued to deform for a long time, with large cumulative deformation, which may influence the land use in the reservoir and landslide control risk judgment. The accumulation landslides with four typical step-like displacement-time curves during more than 10 years, namely Baijiabao landslide, Laoshewo landslide, Heishiban landslide, and Shuping landslide, are demonstrated. The cumulative displacement-time curve of Laoshewo landslide obviously shows that its deforming tendency is slowing down, while that of Heishiban landslide clearly indicates the increasingly serious deformation. When the step-like displacement increments get close to each other, it is harder to predict the landslide tendency based on displacement, velocity, inverse velocity, or acceleration in a whole continuous period. A step-like displacement-time curve can be considered as a curve of a piecewise function, varying as time goes. Therefore, the piecewise function is proposed to analyze the tendency by different time periods. As the environment of rapid deforming period is similar, the deforming tendency of a landslide with step-like displacements can be better demonstrated by collecting data in the rapid deforming period to analyze its tendency. For Shuping landslide, the fluctuating decline in velocity and acceleration in the rapid deforming period shows that the landslide tends to become more and more stable. This well matches the status quo of Shuping landslide, as it has been treated during August 2014 to March 2015, which also verifies the effectiveness of this proposed method. For Baijiabao landslide, the inverse velocity-time curve in the rapid deforming period features fluctuating decline, indicating that the landslide tends to be increasingly unstable. Meanwhile, the discussion on failure prediction found that the watch window for critical prediction of Baijiabao landslide may open in the flood season of several years' future. The method proposed is effective for predicting the deforming tendency of landslides with step-like displacements, provides a time window for critical prediction, and offers technical support for landslide risk control, alarm, and forecasting.","[Lu, Shuqiang; Huang, Bolin] China Three Gorges Univ, Hubei Key Lab Disaster Prevent & Mitigat, Yichang 443002, Peoples R China; [Lu, Shuqiang; Huang, Bolin] China Three Gorges Univ, Natl Field Observat & Res Stn Landslides Three Go, Yichang 443002, Hubei, Peoples R China",,"Huang, BL (corresponding author), China Three Gorges Univ, Hubei Key Lab Disaster Prevent & Mitigat, Yichang 443002, Peoples R China.; Huang, BL (corresponding author), China Three Gorges Univ, Natl Field Observat & Res Stn Landslides Three Go, Yichang 443002, Hubei, Peoples R China.",344043292@qq.com,,,"National Key R&D Program of China [2018YFC1504803]; China Geological SurveyChina Geological Survey [DD20190637]; Geological Hazard Prevention and Control Project [000121 2018C C60 003, 000121 2018C C60 008]","This work was supported by the National Key R&D Program of China (ID: 2018YFC1504803), project from China Geological Survey (DD20190637), and Geological Hazard Prevention and Control Project for Follow-Up Work of the Three Gorges Project (000121 2018C C60 003, 000121 2018C C60 008).

The impacts of climate change and human activities have made accurate inflow prediction increasingly difficult, especially for longer lead times. In this study, a new hybrid inflow forecast framework - using the ERA-Interim reanalysis data set as input and adopting gradient-boosting regression trees (GBRT) and the maximal information coefficient (MIC) - is developed for multistep-ahead daily inflow forecasting. Firstly, the ERA-Interim reanalysis data set provides more information for the framework, allowing it to discover inflow for longer lead times. Secondly, MIC can identify an effective feature subset from massive features that significantly affects inflow; therefore, the framework can reduce computational burden, distinguish key attributes from unimportant ones and provide a concise understanding of inflow. Lastly, GBRT is a prediction model in the form of an ensemble of decision trees, and it has a strong ability to more fully capture nonlinear relationships between input and output at longer lead times. The Xiaowan hydropower station, located in Yunnan Province, China, was selected as the study area. Six evaluation criteria, namely the mean absolute error (MAE), the root-mean-squared error (RMSE), the Pearson correlation coefficient (CORR), Kling-Gupta efficiency (KGE) scores, the percent bias in the flow duration curve high-segment volume (BHV) and the index of agreement (IA) are used to evaluate the established models utilizing historical daily inflow data (1 January 2017-31 December 2018). The performance of the presented framework is compared to that of artificial neural network (ANN), support vector regression (SVR) and multiple linear regression (MLR) models. The results indicate that reanalysis data enhance the accuracy of inflow forecasting for all of the lead times studied (1-10 d), and the method developed generally performs better than other models, especially for extreme values and longer lead times (4-10 d).","[Liao, Shengli; Liu, Zhanwei; Liu, Benxi; Cheng, Chuntian; Jin, Xinfeng; Zhao, Zhipeng] Dalian Univ Technol, Inst Hydropower Syst & Hydroinformat, Dalian 116024, Peoples R China; [Liao, Shengli; Liu, Zhanwei; Liu, Benxi; Cheng, Chuntian; Jin, Xinfeng; Zhao, Zhipeng] Dalian Univ Technol, Minist Educ, Key Lab Ocean Energy Utilizat & Energy Conservat, Dalian 116024, Peoples R China",,"Liu, ZW (corresponding author), Dalian Univ Technol, Inst Hydropower Syst & Hydroinformat, Dalian 116024, Peoples R China.; Liu, ZW (corresponding author), Dalian Univ Technol, Minist Educ, Key Lab Ocean Energy Utilizat & Energy Conservat, Dalian 116024, Peoples R China.",337891617@qq.com,,,"National Natural Science Foundation of ChinaNational Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC) [51979023, U1765103]; Liaoning Province Natural Science Foundation of ChinaNatural Science Foundation of Liaoning Province [20180550354]",This research has been supported by the National Natural Science Foundation of China (grant nos. 51979023 and U1765103) and the Liaoning Province Natural Science Foundation of China (grant no. 20180550354).,,71,8,8,8,24,COPERNICUS GESELLSCHAFT MBH,GOTTINGEN,"BAHNHOFSALLEE 1E, GOTTINGEN, 37081, GERMANY",1027-5606,1607-7938,,HYDROL EARTH SYST SC,Hydrol.

Knowledge of the snow reservoir is therefore important for energy production and water resource management. The land surface model SURFEX with the detailed snowpack scheme Crocus (SURFEX/Crocus) has been run with a grid spacing of 1 km over an area in southern Norway for 2 years (1 September 2014-31 August 2016). Experiments were carried out using two different forcing data sets: (1) hourly forecasts from the operational weather forecast model AROME MetCoOp (2.5 km grid spacing) including post-processed temperature (500 m grid spacing) and wind, and (2) gridded hourly observations of temperature and precipitation (1 km grid spacing) combined with meteorological forecasts from AROME MetCoOp for the remaining weather variables required by SURFEX/Crocus. We present an evaluation of the modelled snow depth and snow cover in comparison to 30 point observations of snow depth and MODIS satellite images of the snow-covered area. The evaluation focuses on snow accumulation and snowmelt. Both experiments are capable of simulating the snowpack over the two winter seasons, but there is an overestimation of snow depth when using meteorological forecasts from AROME MetCoOp (bias of 20 cm and RMSE of 56 cm), although the snow-covered area in the melt season is better represented by this experiment. The errors, when using AROME MetCoOp as forcing, accumulate over the snow season. When using gridded observations, the simulation of snow depth is significantly improved (the bias for this experiment is 7 cm and RMSE 28 cm), but the spatial snow cover distribution is not well captured during the melting season. Underestimation of snow depth at high elevations (due to the low elevation bias in the gridded observation data set) likely causes the snow cover to decrease too soon during the melt season, leading to unrealistically little snow by the end of the season. Our results show that forcing data consisting of post-processed NWP data (observations assimilated into the raw NWP weather predictions) are most promising for snow simulations, when larger regions are evaluated. Post-processed NWP data provide a more representative spatial representation for both high mountains and lowlands, compared to interpolated observations. There is, however, an underestimation of snow ablation in both experiments. This is generally due to the absence of wind-induced erosion of snow in the SURFEX/Crocus model, underestimated snowmelt and biases in the forcing data.","[Luijting, Hanneke; Vikhamar-Schuler, Dagrun; Aspelien, Trygve; Bakketun, Asmund; Homleid, Mariken] Norwegian Meteorol Inst, POB 43, N-0313 Oslo, Norway",,"Luijting, H; Vikhamar-Schuler, D (corresponding author), Norwegian Meteorol Inst, POB 43, N-0313 Oslo, Norway.",hanneke.luijting@gmail.com; dagrunvs@met.no,,,Research Council of Norway through project Better SNOW models for prediction of natural hazards and HydropOWer applications (SNOWHOW),"The authors are grateful for the funding of this study by the Research Council of Norway through the project Better SNOW models for prediction of natural hazards and HydropOWer applications (SNOWHOW), led by Thomas Skaugen at the Norwegian Water Resources and Energy Directorate (NVE).

Other sectors that may also benefit from using seasonal forecasts include (but are not limited to) health, hydrology, water, and energy. This paper shows that seasonal forecast model data, satellite Pour l'Observation de la Terre (SPOT), dry matter productivity (DMP) data (proxy of grass biomass) along with other sets of data are effectively used to estimate grazing capacity (GC) over a 12-year test period (1998/1999-2009/2010) in Limpopo Province. GC comprises a vital consideration in agricultural activities, particularly for a province in South Africa like Limpopo, due to its varying climate. The Limpopo Province capitalizes on subsistence farming, including livestock and crop production. Grazing should thus be regulated in order to conserve grass, shrubs, and trees, thereby ensuring sustainability of rangelands. In a statistical downscaling model, the predictor is the 850 geopotential height fields of a coupled ocean-atmosphere general circulation (CGCM) over Southern Africa to predict seasonal DMP values. This model shows that the mid-summer rainfall totals are important predictors for the November through April (NDJFMA) DMP (as well as grazing capacity) growing season. Forecast verification is conducted using the relative operating characteristics (ROC) and reliability diagrams. The CGCM model shows skill in discriminating high and low DMP (GC) seasons in the Limpopo Province, as well as reliability in the probabilistic forecasts. This paper demonstrates the development of a tailored forecast, an avenue that should be explored in enhancing relevance of forecasts in agricultural production.","[Maluleke, Phumzile] Agr Res Council, Inst Soil Climate & Water, Private Bag X79, ZA-0001 Pretoria, South Africa; [Maluleke, Phumzile; Landman, Willem A.] Univ Pretoria, Dept Geog Geoinformat & Meteorol, Private Bag X41, ZA-0028 Pretoria, South Africa; [Malherbe, Johan] Council Sci & Ind Res Nat Resources & Environm, POB 395, ZA-0001 Pretoria, South Africa; [Archer, Emma] Council Sci & Ind Res Nat Resources & Environm, Bldg 1,Cnr Carlow & Rustenburg Rd, ZA-2092 Johannesburg, South Africa",,"Maluleke, P (corresponding author), Agr Res Council, Inst Soil Climate & Water, Private Bag X79, ZA-0001 Pretoria, South Africa.; Maluleke, P (corresponding author), Univ Pretoria, Dept Geog Geoinformat & Meteorol, Private Bag X41, ZA-0028 Pretoria, South Africa.",malulekep@arc.agric.za,,"Archer, Emma/0000-0002-5374-3866",Agricultural Research Council,This study is based upon work fully supported financially by the Agricultural Research Council.,,46,1,1,0,5,SPRINGER WIEN,WIEN,"SACHSENPLATZ 4-6, PO BOX 89, A-1201 WIEN, AUSTRIA",0177-798X,1434-4483,,THEOR APPL CLIMATOL,Theor.

In recent years, many techniques have been pronounced as a branch of computer science to model wide range of hydrological process. Nevertheless, exploration of more efficient technique is necessary in terms of accuracy and applicability. In this study, a novel hermite-PPR model with SSO and LS algorithm is proposed for designing annual maximum flood peak discharge forecasting model at Yichang station on Yangtze River in China. The statistical properties of the data series are utilized for identifying an appropriate input vector to the model and then the performance of the proposed models were compared with adaptive neuro-fuzzy inference system (ANFIS), artificial neural network (ANN) and multiple linear regression (MLR) methods in terms of root mean squared error (RMSE), mean absolute relative error (MARE), coefficient of correlation (CC), Nash-Sutcliffe efficiency coefficient (NSEC) and qualified rate (QR).

(Clim Dyn 53(3-4):1287-1305, 2019) which provides a comprehensive intercomparison of alternatives for the post-processing (statistical adjustment, calibration and downscaling) of seasonal forecasts for a particularly interesting region, Southeast Asia. To answer the questions that were raised in the preceding work, apart from Bias Adjustment (BA) and ensemble Re-Calibration (RC) methods-which transform directly the variable of interest,-we include here more complex Perfect Prognosis (PP) and Model Outputs Statistics (MOS) downscaling techniques-which operate on a selection of large-scale model circulation variables linked to the local observed variable of interest. Moreover, we test the suitability of BA and PP methods for the post-processing of daily-not only seasonal-time-series, which are often needed in a variety of sectoral applications (crop, hydrology, etc.) or to compute specific climate indices (heat waves, fire weather index, etc.). In addition, we also undertake an assessment of the effect that observational uncertainty may have for statistical post-processing. Our results indicate that PP methods (and to a lesser extent MOS) are highly case-dependent and their application must be carefully analyzed for the region/season/application of interest, since they can either improve or degrade the raw model outputs. Therefore, for those cases for which the use of these methods cannot be carefully tested by experts, our overall recommendation would be the use of BA methods, which seem to be a safe, easy to implement alternative that provide competitive results in most situations. Nevertheless, all methods (including BA ones) seem to be sensitive to observational uncertainty, especially regarding the reproduction of extremes and spells. For MOS and PP methods, this issue can even lead to important regional differences in interannual skill. The lessons learnt from this work can substantially benefit a wide range of end-users in different socio-economic sectors, and can also have important implications for the development of high-quality climate services.","[Manzanas, R.] Univ Cantabria, Meteorol Grp, Dept Matemat Aplicada & Ciencias Comp, Santander, Spain; [Gutierrez, J.

However, the PTF prediction uncertainty was often ignored. In addition, the uncertainty of the N model structure (soil N cycling is described with a set of equations) can also be substantial. Based on the 12 classic pedotransfer functions (PTFs) (namely Baumer, Brakensiek/Rawls, British Soil Survey Topsoil, British Soil Survey Subsoil, EPIC, Hutson, Manrique, Rawls, Campbell, Mayr/Jarvis, Rawls/Brakensiek, and Vereecken) and 2 biogeochemical models (DayCent and DeNitrification-DeComposition (DNDC)), this study evaluated the PTF prediction and model structural uncertainty in soil NO3--N leaching modelling on a tea garden hillslope in Taihu Lake Basin, China. The ensemble mean was then applied to combine the 12 outputs of each model and the 24 outputs of both models. Finally, the linear bias-correction combined with the ensemble mean, i.e., the ensemble bias-correction (EBC), was also applied for the prediction of the leachate NO3--N concentrations. Data on basic soil properties were used to derive the FC and PWP by using the 12 PTFs. Results showed that both the PTF prediction and model structural uncertainty were equally important in soil NW-N leaching modelling at four slope positions. The coefficients of variation of the NO3--N concentration forecasts obtained by different PTFs, representing the PTF prediction uncertainty, were positively related to the climate factors, especially when PTFs were used in DayCent. Ensemble mean was found to produce a very large bias in the prediction of the leachate NO3--N concentrations, which is due to the prediction bias of PTFs.

In this study, two models are developed and applied for water temperature forecasting in lake systems: (1) the multi-layer perceptron neural network (MLPNN) model; and (2) the wavelet transform and MLPNN integrated model (WT_MLPNN). The models are applied to forecast daily lake surface water temperature (LSWT) of eight lowland Polish lakes. Long-term daily LSWT from eight lakes and daily air temperatures from seven meteorological stations are used for daily LSWT forecasting. The results from the two models are compared with those obtained from two other widely used models: the physically-statistically based hybrid air2water model and a non-linear regression model (S-curve). The modelling results show that the air2water model performs the best, followed by the WT_MLPNN, MLPNN, and the non-linear regression model. Overall, the air2water, WT_MLPNN, and MLPNN models reproduce well the seasonal and inter-annual variations of the LSWT dynamics in the eight lakes. The non-linear regression model, although providing the lowest accuracy, can still provide good preliminary estimates of the LSWT for the eight lakes. The outcomes of the present research can provide references for forecasting lake surface water temperature and sustainable management of lake ecosystems.","[Zhu, Senlin; Dai, Jiangyu] Nanjing Hydraul Res Inst, State Key Lab Hydrol Water Resources & Hydraul En, Nanjing 210029, Peoples R China; [Zhu, Senlin] Univ Houston, Cullen Coll Engn, Dept Civil & Environm Engn, Houston, TX 77204 USA; [Ptak, Mariusz] Adam Mickiewicz Univ, Dept Hydrol & Water Management, Krygowskiego 10, PL-61680 Poznan, Poland; [Yaseen, Zaher Mundher] Ton Duc Thang Univ, Fac Civil Engn, Sustainable Dev Civil Engn Res Grp, Ho Chi Minh City, Vietnam; [Sivakumar, Bellie] Indian Inst Technol, Dept Civil Engn, Mumbai 400076, Maharashtra, India",,"Zhu, SL; Dai, JY (corresponding author), Nanjing Hydraul Res Inst, State Key Lab Hydrol Water Resources & Hydraul En, Nanjing 210029, Peoples R China.; Zhu, SL (corresponding author), Univ Houston, Cullen Coll Engn, Dept Civil & Environm Engn, Houston, TX 77204 USA.",slzhu@nhri.cn; marp114@wp.pl; yaseen@tdtu.edu.vn; jydai@nhri.cn; b.sivakumar@iitb.ac.in,"Yaseen, Zaher Mundher/G-7029-2018; Ptak, Mariusz/O-3217-2015","Yaseen, Zaher Mundher/0000-0003-3647-7137; Ptak, Mariusz/0000-0003-1225-1686",Project of the National Natural Science Foundation of ChinaNational Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC) [51679146]; Young Elite Scientists Sponsorship Program by CAST [2017QNRC001]; China Postdoctoral Science FoundationChina Postdoctoral Science Foundation [2018M640499],"The authors acknowledge the Institute of Meteorology and Water Management-National Research Institute in Poland for providing the data used in this study.

Many drought indices are implemented to monitor the current extent and status of drought so stakeholders such as farmers and local governments can appropriately respond. Methods to forecast drought conditions weeks to months in advance are less common but would provide a more effective early warning system to enhance drought response, mitigation, and adaptation planning. To resolve this issue, we introduce DroughtCast, a machine learning framework for forecasting the United States Drought Monitor (USDM). DroughtCast operates on the knowledge that recent anomalies in hydrology and meteorology drive future changes in drought conditions. We use simulated meteorology and satellite observed soil moisture as inputs into a recurrent neural network to accurately forecast the USDM between 1 and 12 weeks into the future. Our analysis shows that precipitation, soil moisture, and temperature are the most important input variables when forecasting future drought conditions. Additionally, a case study of the 2017 Northern Plains Flash Drought shows that DroughtCast was able to forecast a very extreme drought event up to 12 weeks before its onset. Given the favorable forecasting skill of the model, DroughtCast may provide a promising tool for land managers and local governments in preparing for and mitigating the effects of drought.","[Brust, Colin; Kimball, John S.] Univ Montana, WA Franke Coll Forestry & Conservat, Numer Terradynam Simulat Grp, Missoula, MT 59812 USA; [Maneta, Marco P.] Univ Montana, Geosci Dept, Reg Hydrol Lab, Missoula, MT 59812 USA; [Maneta, Marco P.] Univ Montana, WA Franke Coll Forestry & Conservat, Dept Ecosyst & Conservat Sci, Missoula, MT 59812 USA; [Jencso, Kelsey] Univ Montana, WA Franke Coll Forestry & Conservat, Montana Climate Off, Missoula, MT 59812 USA; [Reichle, Rolf H.] NASA, Global Modeling & Assimilat Off, Goddard Space Flight Ctr, Greenbelt, MD USA",,"Brust, C (corresponding author), Univ Montana, WA Franke Coll Forestry & Conservat, Numer Terradynam Simulat Grp, Missoula, MT 59812 USA.",colin.brust@mso.umt.edu,,,"USDAUnited States Department of Agriculture (USDA) [2016-67026-25067]; NASANational Aeronautics & Space Administration (NASA) [80NSSC18M0025M, 80NSSC18K0738, NX14AI50G/JPL#1422120]","& nbsp;This research was conducted at the University of Montana.

However, in karst areas, there is often a lack of suitable precipitation data available to build distributed hydrological models to forecast karst floods. Quantitative precipitation forecasts (QPFs) and estimates (QPEs) could provide rational methods to acquire the available precipitation data for karst areas. Furthermore, coupling a physically based hydrological model with QPFs and QPEs could greatly enhance the performance and extend the lead time of flood forecasting in karst areas. This study served two main purposes. One purpose was to compare the performance of the Weather Research and Forecasting (WRF) QPFs with that of the Precipitation Estimations through Remotely Sensed Information based on the Artificial Neural Network-Cloud Classification System (PERSIANN-CCS) QPEs in rainfall forecasting in karst river basins. The other purpose was to test the feasibility and effective application of karst flood simulation and forecasting by coupling the WRF and PERSIANN models with the Karst-Liuxihe model. The rainfall forecasting results showed that the precipitation distributions of the 2 weather models were very similar to the observed rainfall results. However, the precipitation amounts forecasted by WRF QPF were larger than those measured by the rain gauges, while the quantities forecasted by the PERSIANN-CCS QPEs were smaller. A postprocessing algorithm was proposed in this paper to correct the rainfall estimates produced by the two weather models. The flood simulations achieved based on the postprocessed WRF QPF and PERSIANN-CCS QPEs coupled with the Karst-Liuxihe model were much improved over previous results. In particular, coupling the postprocessed WRF QPF with the Karst-Liuxihe model could greatly extend the lead time of flood forecasting, and a maximum lead time of 96 h is adequate for flood warnings and emergency responses, which is extremely important in flood simulations and forecasting.","[Li, Ji; Yuan, Daoxian; Sun, Yuchuan] Southwest Univ, Chongqing Jinfo Mt Karst Ecosyst Natl Observ & Re, Sch Geog Sci, Chongqing 400715, Peoples R China; [Li, Ji; Yuan, Daoxian; Li, Jianhong] CAGS, Inst Karst Geol, Key Lab Karst Dynam MNR & Guangxi, Guilin 541004, Peoples R China",,"Li, J (corresponding author), Southwest Univ, Chongqing Jinfo Mt Karst Ecosyst Natl Observ & Re, Sch Geog Sci, Chongqing 400715, Peoples R China.; Li, J (corresponding author), CAGS, Inst Karst Geol, Key Lab Karst Dynam MNR & Guangxi, Guilin 541004, Peoples R China.",445776649@qq.com,,,"National Science Foundation for Young Scientists of China [42101031]; Chongqing Natural Science FoundationNatural Science Foundation of Chongqing [cstc2021jcyj-msxm0007]; Open Project Program of Guangxi Key Science and Technology Innovation Base on Karst Dynamics (KDL Guangxi) [202009, 202012]; National Natural Science Foundation of ChinaNational Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC) [41830648]","This study was supported by the National Science Foundation for Young Scientists of China (No. 42101031), Chongqing Natural Science Foundation (No. cstc2021jcyj-msxm0007), the Open Project Program of Guangxi Key Science and Technology Innovation Base on Karst Dynamics (KDL & Guangxi 202009, KDL & Guangxi 202012), and the National Natural Science Foundation of China (Grant No. 41830648).",,62,0,0,6,6,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"ONE NEW YORK PLAZA, SUITE 4600, NEW YORK, NY, UNITED STATES",2095-0195,2095-0209,,FRONT EARTH SCI-PRC,Front.

As the Hanjiang River Basin (HRB) is the water source of the middle line of the South-to-North Water Diversion Project, it has higher requirements for water resources accurate prediction. In order to analyze the prediction capabilities of different prediction methods for the HRB runoff, this study constructed 12 prediction models to simulate and predict the runoff of four hydrological stations in the HRB. Furthermore, the Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) method was used to analyze the transition probability of runoff from low-to-high (high-to-low). The results showed that the runoff of four hydrological stations in the HRB all showed a downward trend, and most of the sudden changes occurred in the 1980 s. The smoother the runoff changes, the easier it is to make accurate prediction. Among the 12 models, the quadric spline Markov forecasting model (QS-MFM), moving average Markov forecasting model (MA-MFM), Markov forecasting model (MFM), deep neural networks (DNN), and cubic exponential smoothing (CES) methods have stronger generalization ability and can more accurately predict the runoff of the HRB. The average relative error during the validation period is 0.27, 0.28, 0.33, 0.34 and 0.39, respectively. The logistic model can accurately simulate the change of runoff status in the HRB. The wet threshold of Baihe (BH), Huanglongtan (HLT), Huangjiagang (HJG), and Huangzhuang (HZ) is 819.9 m(3)/s, 207.4 m(3)/s, 1313.9 m(3)/s and 1681.7 m(3)/s, and the dry threshold is 480.4 m(3)/s, 130.6. m(3)/s, 817.8 m(3)/s and 1083.4 m(3)/s, respectively. The MCMC method can accurately estimate the parameters of the logistic model, and the low-high (high-low) runoff transition probability model constructed in the HRB can accurately calculate the low to high (high to low) runoff transition probability.","[Jin, Haoyu; Chen, Xiaohong; Zhong, Ruida] Sun Yat Sen Univ, Ctr Water Resources & Environm, Guangzhou 510275, Peoples R China; [Jin, Haoyu; Chen, Xiaohong; Zhong, Ruida] Sun Yat Sen Univ, Guangdong Engn Technol Res Ctr Water Secur Regula, Guangzhou 510275, Peoples R China; [Jin, Haoyu; Chen, Xiaohong; Zhong, Ruida] Sun Yat Sen Univ, Guangdong High Educ Inst, Key Lab Water Cycle & Water Secur Southern China, Guangzhou 510275, Peoples R China",,"Chen, XH (corresponding author), Sun Yat Sen Univ, Ctr Water Resources & Environm, Guangzhou 510275, Peoples R China.; Chen, XH (corresponding author), Sun Yat Sen Univ, Guangdong Engn Technol Res Ctr Water Secur Regula, Guangzhou 510275, Peoples R China.; Chen, XH (corresponding author), Sun Yat Sen Univ, Guangdong High Educ Inst, Key Lab Water Cycle & Water Secur Southern China, Guangzhou 510275, Peoples R China.",eescxh@mail.sysu.edu.cn,,,"National Natural Science Foundation of ChinaNational Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC) [U1911204, 51861125203]; National Key R&D Program of China [2017YFC0405900]; Project for Creative Research from Guangdong Water Resources Department [2018, 2020]","The research is financially supported by National Natural Science Foundation of China (Grant Nos.

Flux constraints are rarely, if ever, applied. Consequently, model states can be adjusted beyond physically reasonable limits, compromising the integrity of model output. In this paper, we investigate the effect of constraining the EnKF on forecast performance. A free run in which no assimilation is applied is compared to a completely unconstrained EnKF implementation, a 'typical' hydrological implementation (in which mass constraints are enforced to ensure non-negativity and capacity thresholds of model states are not exceeded), and then to a more tightly constrained implementation where flux as well as mass constraints are imposed to force the rate of water movement to/from ensemble states to be within physically consistent boundaries. A three year period (2008-2010) was selected from the available data record (1976-2010). This was specifically chosen as it had no significant data gaps and represented well the range of flows observed in the longer dataset. Over this period, the standard implementation of the EnKF (no constraints) contained eight hydrological events where (multiple) physically inconsistent state adjustments were made. All were selected for analysis. Mass constraints alone did little to improve forecast performance; in fact, several were significantly degraded compared to the free run. In contrast, the combined use of mass and flux constraints significantly improved forecast performance in six events relative to all other implementations, while the remaining two events showed no significant difference in performance. Placing flux as well as mass constraints on the data assimilation framework encourages physically consistent state estimation and results in more accurate and reliable forward predictions of streamflow for robust decision-making. We also experiment with the observation error, which has a profound effect on filter performance. We note an interesting tension exists between specifying an error which reflects known uncertainties and errors in the measurement versus an error that allows optimal filter updating.

Satellite remote sensing is therefore increasingly being integrated with existing in situ water quality monitoring programs. In this study, we use the Landsat TM/ETM+ image record collected between 1984 and 2015 to track temporal changes in trophic status, chlorophyll-a levels, algal bloom incidences, water clarity, water temperature, and reservoir water volume in a poorly monitored hypereutrophic semi-arid reservoir. Historical reservoir water quality data are inferred from calibrated Landsat-based empirical algorithms. The results show that, although the reservoir has existed in a eutrophic to hypereutrophic state over the past 30years, its water quality has significantly deteriorated in the most recent decade. Mean summer chlorophyll-a concentrations were found to have increased by around 163% between 1984 and 2015, while water clarity dropped by more than 58% over the same period. Statistically significant changes in surface water temperatures were also apparent for the month of August, with a cumulative increase of 1.24 degrees C over the 31-year study period. The rise in temperature appears to correlate with the incidence of Microcystis blooms observed in the reservoir over the past decade. On the other hand, the water volume in the reservoir was found to have been fairly stable over time, likely as a result of adaptive reservoir management. This study demonstrates the strength of using Landsat data to hindcast and quantify changes in water quality and quantity in poorly monitored freshwater systems.","[Deutsch, Eliza S.; Alameddine, Ibrahim] Amer Univ Beirut, Maroun Semaan Fac Engn & Architecture, Dept Civil & Environm Engn, Bliss St, Beirut, Lebanon",,"Alameddine, I (corresponding author), Amer Univ Beirut, Maroun Semaan Fac Engn & Architecture, Dept Civil & Environm Engn, Bliss St, Beirut, Lebanon.",ia04@aub.edu.lb,"Alameddine, Ibrahim/R-5332-2019; Alameddine, Ibrahim/D-9365-2013","Alameddine, Ibrahim/0000-0002-8974-1985; ",United States Agency for International Development through the USAID-NSF PEER initiativeUnited States Agency for International Development (USAID)National Science Foundation (NSF)NSF - Office of the Director (OD) [AID-OAA-A-I1-00012]; US National Science Foundation under (NSF)National Science Foundation (NSF) [CBET-1058027]; American University of Beirut University Research Board [103008]; National Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada (NSERC) PGS-D Scholarship Program,This study was generously supported through the United States Agency for International Development through the USAID-NSF PEER initiative (grant no.

As compared with observations and reanalysis data, the model can reasonably reproduce the spatial distributions of the climatological mean atmospheric circulation and water vapour transport in East Asia, as well as the seasonal advance and retreat of EASM and rain bands. The correlation coefficient between the EASM circulation index in the simulation and reanalysis is .97. The model can well represent the geographic distributions of summer mean temperature and precipitation over most of China. However, model biases still exist, in particular the skill in the Yangtze-Huaihe River basin is relatively low. The simulated climatological mean temperature and precipitation deviations from observations may be related to the model's systematic circulation biases, with a thicker lower troposphere (i.e., higher temperature between 500 and 1,000 hPa) over most of China (except for the south and southwest) and a thinner one over the coastal oceans in summertime. Compared with the reanalysis, the model overestimates the land-ocean thermal contrast, which causes the South Asian High shifted to the north and east, as well as the subtropical high and tropical convective activity located further north and persisted longer. Consequently, more water vapour transports northward, leading to more precipitation over North China-Northeast China and less precipitation over the Yangtze and Huaihe River basin. Therefore, the enhanced land-ocean thermal contrast may be a major factor for the stronger EASM in the model, and corresponding precipitation and temperature biases in China. This analysis provides important information for further improving model performance in EASM simulation.","[Li, Qingquan; Wang, Fang; Zhao, Chongbo; Dong, Lili; Xie, Bing] China Meteorol Adm, Natl Climate Ctr, Lab Climate Studies, Beijing, Peoples R China; [Li, Qingquan; Wang, Fang] Nanjing Univ Informat Sci & Technol, Collaborat Innovat Ctr Forecast & Evaluat Meteoro, Joint Int Res Lab Climate & Environm Change, Key Lab Meteorol Disaster,Minist Educ, Nanjing, Peoples R China; [Wang, Tao; Zhao, Chunyu] Shenyang Reg Climate Ctr, Shenyang 110166, Peoples R China; [Liang, Xin-Zhong] Univ Maryland, Dept Atmospher & Ocean Sci, College Pk, MD 20742 USA",,"Wang, T (corresponding author), Shenyang Reg Climate Ctr, Shenyang 110166, Peoples R China.",nick_bsb@126.com,,,National Natural Science Foundation of ChinaNational Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC) [41790471]; National Key Scientific Research Plan of China [2016YFA0602200]; Second Tibetan Plateau Scientific Expedition and Research Program of China [2019QZKK0208]; Strategic Priority Research Program of the Chinese Academy of SciencesChinese Academy of Sciences [XDA20100304],"National Natural Science Foundation of China, Grant/Award Number: 41790471; the National Key Scientific Research Plan of China, Grant/Award Number: 2016YFA0602200; the Second Tibetan Plateau Scientific Expedition and Research Program of China, Grant/Award Number: 2019QZKK0208; the Strategic Priority Research Program of the Chinese Academy of Sciences, Grant/Award Number: XDA20100304",,67,2,2,3,10,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0899-8418,1097-0088,,INT J CLIMATOL,Int.

The synthetic well data is then used to generate diagnostic log-rate log-time plots, which allow for a distinction of four types of flow regimes. Such a distinction of flow regimes is of practical relevance, because of the inverse link with reservoir properties and fracture treatment design parameters. Each flow regime has a characteristic slope, which traditionally has been attributed to typical flow conditions in the reservoir. The synthetic production data from the reservoir simulator are used to constrain b-sigmoid patterns for narrow discrete time increments of production (1 month) throughout the various flow regimes occurring during the economic life of each synthetic well model. Nearly a hundred different models were generated as a basis for our analysis. From the analysis of the DCA parameters for time series, using the difference in inverse of decline rates (loss ratio) for two adjacent time steps, it appears possible to recognize systematic shifts in the instantaneous decline rates and temporal b-values. In particular, the generated b-value patterns (b-sigmoids) appear diagnostic for flow regime changes recognized on diagnostic log-rate log-time plots. The results demonstrate that it is possible, based on well design and reservoir parameters, to establish correlation trends between b-sigmoids and flow regime changes using time series of the DCA parameters. The results are subsequently used to improve the accuracy of a modified 3-segment DCA method based on Arps equation. The proposed method is applied to synthetic production data, generated based on an Eagle Ford shale oil well (with known reservoir and fracture properties), to demonstrate the practical value for production forecasting and reserves estimation. This research paper paves the way for wider, future application of the methods described.","[Tugan, Murat Fatih; Weijermars, Ruud] Texas A&M Univ, Harold Vance Dept Petr Engn, 3116 TAMU, College Stn, TX 77843 USA",,"Tugan, MF (corresponding author), Texas A&M Univ, Harold Vance Dept Petr Engn, 3116 TAMU, College Stn, TX 77843 USA.",muratfatihtugan@gmail.com,,"Tugan, Murat Fatih/0000-0002-3737-7106; Weijermars, Ruud/0000-0002-0884-385X",TUBITAK (The Scientific and Technological Research Council of Turkey)Turkiye Bilimsel ve Teknolojik Arastirma Kurumu (TUBITAK),Dr. Tugan would like to acknowledge TUBITAK (The Scientific and Technological Research Council of Turkey) for support of his postdoctoral research (2219 programme) in the Harold Vance Department of Petroleum Engineering at Texas A&M University.,,39,5,5,0,0,ELSEVIER,AMSTERDAM,"RADARWEG 29, 1043 NX AMSTERDAM, NETHERLANDS",0920-4105,1873-4715,,J PETROL SCI ENG,J.

The area of study was Lake Serwy, located in northeastern Poland. Two artificial neural network (ANN) multilayer perceptron (MLP) and multiple linear regression (MLR) models were built. The following explanatory variables were considered: maximal and minimal temperature (Tmax, Tmin) wind speed (WS), vertical circulation (VC) and water level from previous periods (WL). Additionally, a binary variable describing the period of the year (winter, summer) has been considered in one of the two MLP and MLR models. The forecasting models have been assessed based on selected criteria: mean absolute percentage error (MAPE), root mean squared error (RMSE), coefficient of determination (R2) and mean biased error. Considering their values and absolute deviations from observed values it was concluded that the ANN model using an additional binary variable (MLP_B+) has the best forecasting performance. Absolute deviations from observed values were the determining factor which made this model the most efficient. In the case of the MLP_B+ model, those values were about 10% lower than in other models. The conducted analyses indicated good performance of ANN networks as a forecasting tool for relatively small lakes located in temperate climate zones. It is acknowledged that they enable water level forecasting with greater precision and lower absolute deviations than the use of multiple linear regression models.","[Piasecki, Adam; Skowron, Rajmund] Nicholas Copernicus Univ, Dept Hydrol & Water Management, Lwowska 1, PL-87100 Torun, Poland; [Jurasz, Jakub] AGH Univ Sci & Technol, Fac Management, Dept Engn Management, Ul Gramatyka 10, PL-30067 Krakow, Poland",,"Jurasz, J (corresponding author), AGH Univ Sci & Technol, Fac Management, Dept Engn Management, Ul Gramatyka 10, PL-30067 Krakow, Poland.",jakubkamiljurasz@gmail.com,"Jurasz, Jakub/ABG-4056-2020; Jurasz, Jakub/T-1759-2017","Jurasz, Jakub/0000-0001-9576-7877; Jurasz, Jakub/0000-0001-9576-7877; Piasecki, Adam/0000-0002-8787-7520",,,,41,8,8,0,1,VILNIUS GEDIMINAS TECH UNIV,VILNIUS,"SAULETEKIO AL 11, VILNIUS, LT-10223, LITHUANIA",1648-6897,1822-4199,,J ENVIRON ENG LANDSC,J.

However, millions of simulation runs may be required in MCMC for accurate sampling of posterior as subsurface flow problems are highly nonlinear and non-Gaussian. Similarly, EnKF formulated on the basis of linear and Gaussian assumptions may also require a large number of realizations to correctly map the solution space of the unknown model parameters, ultimately resulting in the high computational cost. Data-driven meta/surrogate/proxy models provide an alternative solution to alleviate the issue of high computational cost. Since these models are not as accurate as numerical solutions of partial differential equations (PDE), their implementation may add an uncertainty in the forecast model. In literature, the effect of uncertainty in forecast model on data assimilation is not well studied, especially with field-scale reservoir models. In this work, we take the opportunity to evaluate and compare the performance of EnKF and MCMC using polynomial chaos expansion (PCE) based forecast model. Proposed forecast model relies on reducing parameter space using Karhunen-Loeve (KL) expansion which preserves the two-point statistics of the field. Random variables from KL expansion and orthogonal polynomials corresponding to the prior probability density function (pdf) form the set of input parameters in PCE. Further, non-intrusive probabilistic collocation method (PCM) is used to compute PCE coefficients. PCE forecast model is then used in EnKF and MCMC to calculate the likelihood of the samples in place of high fidelity full physics simulation runs. A case study is performed using a 3D field scale model of a reservoir located near Fort McMurray in northern Alberta, Canada. Performance of EnKF and MCMC are assessed under forecast model uncertainty using rigorous qualitative and quantitative analysis and posterior distribution characterization. Results clearly depict that, although EnKF provided reliable mean and variance estimates of model parameters, MCMC outperformed the former even under the uncertainty associated with PCE metamodel. Inaccurate initial assumptions of model parameters were successfully handled by MCMC, although, with a longer burn-in period. Furthermore, characterization of posterior demonstrated reduced uncertainty in the estimation of model parameters using MCMC as compared to EnKF. Practical implications of the proposed approach and performance assessment under forecast model uncertainty will be consequential in designing accurate and computationally efficient reservoir characterization workflows and hence, improved decision-making in reservoir management.","[Patel, Rajan G.; Jain, Tarang; Trivedi, Japan] Univ Alberta, Sch Min & Petr Engn, Dept Civil & Environm Engn, 6-289 Donadeo Innovat Ctr Engn, Edmonton, AB, Canada",,"Trivedi, J (corresponding author), Univ Alberta, Sch Min & Petr Engn, Dept Civil & Environm Engn, 6-289 Donadeo Innovat Ctr Engn, Edmonton, AB, Canada.",rgpatel@ualberta.ca; tarang@ualberta.ca; jtrivedi@ualberta.ca,"Trivedi, Japan/AAG-6256-2019; Jain, Tarang K/O-2421-2016","Trivedi, Japan/0000-0002-3681-6664; ",Canada First Research Excellence Fund; Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of CanadaNatural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada (NSERC)CGIAR; ConocoPhillips Canada Limited,"As a part of the University of Alberta's Future Energy Systems research initiative, this research was made possible in part thanks to funding from the Canada First Research Excellence Fund.

One way to manage its socioeconomic effects is based on precipitation forecasts from numerical weather prediction (NWP) models, and an important step to improve precipitation forecasts is by diagnosing NWP biases. In this study, we investigate the biases in precipitation forecasts from the European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts Integrated Forecasting System (IFS). Using the IFS control forecast from 12 June 2019 to 11 June 2020 at 5219 stations globally, we show that in each of the boreal winter and summer half years, the IFS 1) has an average global wet bias and 2) displays similar bias patterns for forecasts starting at 0000 and 1200 UTC and across forecast days 1-5. These biases are dependent on observed (climatological) precipitation; stations with low observed precipitation have an IFS wet bias, while stations with high observed precipitation have an IFS dry bias. Southeast Asia has a wet bias of 1.61 mm day(-1) (in boreal summer) and over the study period the precipitation is overestimated by 31.0% on forecast day 3. This is the hydrological signature of several hypothesized processes including issues specifying the IFS snowpack over the Tibetan Plateau, which may affect the mei-yu front. These biases have implications for IFS land-atmosphere feedbacks, river discharge, and for ocean circulation in the Southeast Asia region. Reducing these biases could lead to more accurate forecasts of the global water cycle.","[Lavers, David A.; Harrigan, Shaun; Prudhomme, Christel] European Ctr Medium Range Weather Forecasts, Reading, Berks, England; [Lavers, David A.] Univ Birmingham, Sch Geog Earth & Environm Sci, Birmingham, W Midlands, England; [Prudhomme, Christel] UK Ctr Ecol & Hydrol, Wallingford, Oxon, England; [Prudhomme, Christel] Loughborough Univ, Geog Dept, Loughborough, Leics, England",,"Lavers, DA (corresponding author), European Ctr Medium Range Weather Forecasts, Reading, Berks, England.; Lavers, DA (corresponding author), Univ Birmingham, Sch Geog Earth & Environm Sci, Birmingham, W Midlands, England.",david.lavers@ecmwf.int,,,European Union Copernicus Emergency Management Service [198702],"The authors acknowledge financial support from the European Union Copernicus Emergency Management Service (Framework Contract 198702).

Based on this, a mid and long-term hydrological classification prediction model based on KDE-BDA was built. An example of its application is demonstrated in the runoff forecast of the Danjiangkou Reservoir in the autumn of September. The results show that different forecasting factors have different forecasting ability for runoff classification (flood, normal, dry). Among them, the 500hPa height field factor has higher forecasting ability for the Danjiangkou runoff category (flood, normal, dry), and the 100hPa height field factor, SST and circulation characteristics have a good indication of the runoff's flood state.

Sparse coverage of conventional observations over the Pacific Ocean, which can cause inadequate upstream initial conditions for numerical weather prediction models, may limit the improvement of forecast skill for these events. A targeted field program called AR Reconnaissance (Recon) was initiated in 2016 to better understand and reduce forecast errors of landfalling ARs at 1-5 days lead times. During the winter seasons of 2016, 2018, and 2019, 15 Intensive Observation Periods (IOPs) sampled the upstream conditions for landfalling ARs. This study evaluates the impact on forecast accuracy of assimilating these dropsonde data. Data denial experiments with (WithDROP) and without (NoDROP) dropsonde data were conducted using the Weather Research and Forecasting model with the Gridpoint Statistical Interpolation four-dimensional ensemble variational system. Comparisons between the 15 paired NoDROP and WithDROP experiments demonstrate that AR Recon dropsondes reduced the root-mean-square error in integrated vapor transport (IVT) and inland precipitation for more than 70% of the IOPs, averaged over all forecast lead times from 1 to 6 days. Dropsondes have improved the spatial pattern of forecasts of IVT and precipitation in all 15 IOPs. Significant improvements in skill are found beyond the short range (1-2 days). IOP sequences (i.e., back-to-back IOPs every other day) show the most improvement of inland precipitation forecast skill.","[Zheng, Minghua; Delle Monache, Luca; Ralph, F.

Artificial intelligence (AI) models have contributed significantly over the last few decades by providing improved accuracy and economical solutions to simulate physical flood processes. This study explores the potential of the AI computing paradigm to model the stream flow. Artificial neural network (ANN), fuzzy logic, and adaptive neuro-fuzzy inference system (ANFIS) algorithms are used to develop nine different flood prediction models using all the available training algorithms. The performance of the developed models is evaluated using multiple statistical performance evaluators. The predictability and robustness of the models are tested through the simulation of a major flood event in the study area. A total of 12 inputs were used in the development of the models. Five training algorithms were used to develop the ANN models (Bayesian regularization, Levenberg Marquardt, conjugate gradient, scaled conjugate gradient, and resilient backpropagation), two fuzzy inference systems to develop fuzzy models (Mamdani and Sugeno), and two training algorithms to develop the ANFIS models (hybrid and backpropagation). The ANFIS model developed using hybrid training algorithm gave the best performance metrics with Nash-Sutcliffe Model Efficiency (NSE) of 0.968, coefficient of correlation (R-2) of 97.066%, mean square error (MSE) of 0.00034, root mean square error (RMSE) of 0.018, mean absolute error (MAE) of 0.0073, and combined accuracy (CA) of 0.018, implying the potential of using the developed models for flood forecasting. The significance of this research lies in the fact that a combination of multiple inputs and AI algorithms has been used to develop the flood models. In summary, this research revealed the potential of AI algorithm-based models in predicting floods and also developed some useful techniques that can be used by the Flood Control Departments of various states/regions/countries for flood prognosis.","[Tabbussum, Ruhhee; Dar, Abdul Qayoom] Natl Inst Technol Srinagar, Dept Civil Engn, Srinagar 190006, Jammu & Kashmir, India",,"Tabbussum, R (corresponding author), Natl Inst Technol Srinagar, Dept Civil Engn, Srinagar 190006, Jammu & Kashmir, India.",ruhhee_10phd17@nitsri.ac.in; aqayoom20011@yahoo.com,"Tabbussum, Ruhhee/AAT-4239-2020","Tabbussum, Ruhhee/0000-0002-9926-6276; Dar, Abdul Qayoom/0000-0001-7663-2168",Ministry of Human Resources and Development-India,"This research is funded by the Ministry of Human Resources and Development-India, through the scholarship granted to Ruhhee Tabbussum.",,99,4,4,1,8,SPRINGER HEIDELBERG,HEIDELBERG,"TIERGARTENSTRASSE 17, D-69121 HEIDELBERG, GERMANY",0944-1344,1614-7499,,ENVIRON SCI POLLUT R,Environ.

It is, therefore, critical to evaluate the skill of AR forecasts in numerical weather prediction (NWP) models. A new verification framework is proposed that leverages freely available software and metrics previously used for different applications. Specifically, AR detection and statistics are computed for the first time using the Method for Object-Based Diagnostic Evaluation (MODE). In addition, the measure of effectiveness (MoE) is introduced as a new metric for understanding AR forecast skill in terms of size and location. The MoE provides a quantitative measure of the position of an entire forecast AR relative to observation, regardless of whether the AR is making landfall. In addition, the MoE can provide qualitative information about the evolution of a forecast by lead time, with implications about the predictability of an AR. We analyze AR forecast verification and skill using 11 years of cold-season forecasts from two NWP models: one global and one regional. Four different thresholds of integrated vapor transport (IVT) are used in the verification, revealing differences in forecast skill that are based on the strength of an AR. In addition to MoE, AR forecast skill is also addressed in terms of intensity error, landfall position error, and contingency-table metrics.","[DeHaan, Laurel L.; Weihs, Rachel R.; Delle Monache, Luca; Ralph, F.

Variety of techniques like engineering (construction of dams and reservoirs) and non engineering (prior investigation of flash floods) has been advanced to forecast the run offs. An efficient disaster management system requires early predicted recommendations for rescue and announcement of exit routes in heavy runoffs. Sewages are the most complex mixture therefore it is not an easy task to build a model for the estimation of rainfall magnitude and time of non-linear runoffs occurrence. Earth can be regarded as a source of magnetic field known as geomagnetic field having range from 25 mu T to 65 mu T. This research paper elaborated the investigation of flash floods by observing the magnetic field lines using Tesla or magnetometer. Hourly based reading of magnetometer shows that during the runoffs the geomagnetic field briskly reduced. Results proved that during the run offs geomagnetic radiated by the earth got promptly reduced therefore geomagnetic field can be a yardstick to estimate the flash floods. In the 1st Hour, 2nd Hour, 3rd Hour and 4th Hour the geomagnetic field at the earth surface was observed 35 mu T, 25 mu T, 25 mu T and 30 mu T.

There is an increasing demand, however, for even higher-spatial resolution hydrologic products. In this paper, we assess the ability of the current streamflow product to capture the hydrologic response of urban catchments in the DFW area, the utility of ultrasonic distance sensors for real-time sensing of water level in urban streams, and the feasibility of higher-resolution operation using parallel processing and cloud computing. We show that the CASA WX streamflow product skillfully captures the stage and streamflow response from rainfall for the majority of the nine catchments studied, but that timing errors significantly deteriorate the quality of streamflow prediction for certain basins.

Essentially, HCC is a cross-disciplinary research domain, in which the core idea is to build an efficient interaction among persons, cyber space, and real world. Inspired by the improvement of HCC on big data analysis, we intend to involve related core and technologies to help solve one of the most important issues in the real world, i.e., flood prediction. To minimize the negative impacts brought by floods, researchers pay special attention to improve the accuracy of flood forecasting with quantity of technologies including HCC. However, historical flood data is essentially imbalanced. Imbalanced data causes machine learning classifiers to be more biased towards patterns with majority samples, resulting in poor classification of pattern with minority samples. In this paper, we propose a novel Synthetic Minority Over-sampling Technique (SMOTE)-Boost-based sparse Bayesian model to perform flood prediction with both high accuracy and robustness. The proposed model consists of three modules, namely, SMOTE-based data enhancement, AdaBoost training strategy, and sparse Bayes model construction. In SMOTE-based data enhancement, we adopt a SMOTE algorithm to effectively cover diverse data modes and generate more samples for prediction pattern with minority samples, which greatly alleviates the problem of imbalanced data by involving experts' analysis and users' intentions. During AdaBoost training strategy, we propose a specifically designed AdaBoost training strategy for sparse Bayesian model, which not only adaptively and inclemently increases prediction ability of Bayesian model, but also prevents its over-fitting performance. Essentially, the design of AdaBoost strategy helps keep balance between prediction ability and model complexity, which offers different but effective models over diverse rivers and users. Finally, we construct a sparse Bayesian model based on AdaBoost training strategy, which could offer flood prediction results with high rationality and robustness. We demonstrate the accuracy and effectiveness of the proposed model for flood prediction by conducting experiments on a collected dataset with several comparative methods.","[Wu, Yirui; Ding, Yukai; Feng, Jun] Hohai Univ, Coll Comp & Informat, Nanjing, Peoples R China",,"Feng, J (corresponding author), Hohai Univ, Coll Comp & Informat, Nanjing, Peoples R China.",fengjun@hhu.edu.cn,,,"National Key R&D Program of China [2018YFC0407901]; Natural Science Foundation of ChinaNational Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC) [61702160, 61672273, 61832008]; Science Foundation of Jiangsu [BK20170892]; Key R&D Program Projects in Jiangsu Province [BE2015707]","This work was supported by the National Key R&D Program of China under Grant 2018YFC0407901; the Natural Science Foundation of China under Grant 61702160, Grant 61672273, and Grant 61832008; the Science Foundation of Jiangsu under Grant BK20170892; and Key R&D Program Projects in Jiangsu Province under Grant BE2015707.",,44,3,3,0,3,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"ONE NEW YORK PLAZA, SUITE 4600, NEW YORK, NY, UNITED STATES",1687-1472,1687-1499,,EURASIP J WIREL COMM,EURASIP J.

Traditionally, the class of autoregressive moving average techniques models has been the statistical method most widely used for modelling water discharge, but it has been shown to be deficient in representing nonlinear dynamics inherent in the transformation of runoff data. In contrast, the relatively newly improved and efficient soft computing technique artificial neural networks has the capability to approximate virtually any continuous function up to an arbitrary degree of accuracy, which is not otherwise true of other conventional hydrological techniques. This technique corresponds to human neurological system, which consists of a series of basic computing elements called neurons, which are interconnected together to form networks. The aim of the study is to compare the artificial neural network and autoregressive integrated moving average to model River Opeki discharge (1982-2010) and to use the best predictor to forecast the discharge of the river from 2010 to 2020. The performance of the two models was subjected to statistical test based on correlation coefficient (r) and the root-mean-square error.

A complex pattern of ozone precursor emissions interfaces with a complex meteorological environment, presenting a challenge for air quality management and simulation. Precursors are transported into a shallow, stable boundary layer over the lake. This is followed by ozone formation and transport back onshore through a combination of synoptic and lake breeze winds. In this study, we use measurements during the Lake Michigan Ozone Study 2017 (LMOS) to quantitatively evaluate the Weather Research and Forecasting with Chemistry (WRF-Chem) model at 4 km horizontal resolution for key features of high ozone episodes over Southern Lake Michigan, with a focus on meteorological performance. WRF-Chem showed good performance and successful reproduction of meteorological fields and clouds. Lake breeze model skill was inconsistent, with both good and poor performance depending on site and day. The combination of Noah land surface model and High-Resolution Rapid Refresh meteorology gave the best performance with the mean bias of -0.5 degrees C for temperature, -0.6 degrees C for dewpoint temperature, and -0.3 m/s for wind speed along the western coast of Lake Michigan during the daytime. For ozone, WRF-Chem was biased low (-4.4 ppb mean bias for daytime ozone) and underestimated hourly peak ozone. In some cases, ozone bias can be attributed to transport and lake breeze errors. Average ozone concentration showed minor (<2 ppb) sensitivity to changes to meteorology initial and boundary conditions or the land surface model.","[Abdi-Oskouei, M.] Univ Corp Atmospher Res, Boulder, CO 80305 USA; [Abdi-Oskouei, M.; Carmichael, G.; Christiansen, M.; Ferrada, G.; Roozitalab, B.; Sobhani, N.; Stanier, C.] Univ Iowa, Ctr Global & Reg Environm Res, Iowa City, IA 52242 USA; [Carmichael, G.; Christiansen, M.; Ferrada, G.; Roozitalab, B.; Wade, K.; Stanier, C.] Univ Iowa, Chem & Biochem Engn, Iowa City, IA USA; [Christiansen, M.; Wade, K.; Stanier, C.] Univ Iowa, IIHR Hydrosci & Engn, Iowa City, IA USA; [Sobhani, N.] NCAR, Boulder, CO USA; [Czarnetzki, A.] Univ Northern Iowa, Dept Earth & Environm Sci, Cedar Falls, IA USA; [Pierce, R.

In this paper, a hybrid model called SVR-HUP is presented to predict long-term runoff and quantify the prediction uncertainty. The model is created based on three steps. First, appropriate predictors are selected according to the correlations between meteorological factors and runoff. Second, a support vector regression (SVR) model is structured and optimized based on the LibSVM toolbox and a genetic algorithm. Finally, using forecasted and observed runoff, a hydrologic uncertainty processor (HUP) based on a Bayesian framework is used to estimate the posterior probability distribution of the simulated values, and the associated uncertainty of prediction was quantitatively analyzed. Six precision evaluation indexes, including the correlation coefficient (CC), relative root mean square error (RRMSE), relative error (RE), mean absolute percentage error (MAPE), Nash-Sutcliffe efficiency (NSE), and qualification rate (QR), are used to measure the prediction accuracy. As a case study, the proposed approach is applied in the Han River basin, South Central China. Three types of SVR models are established to forecast the monthly, flood season and annual runoff volumes. The results indicate that SVR yields satisfactory accuracy and reliability at all three scales. In addition, the results suggest that the HUP cannot only quantify the uncertainty of prediction based on a confidence interval but also provide a more accurate single value prediction than the initial SVR forecasting result. Thus, the SVR-HUP model provides an alternative method for long-term runoff forecasting.","[Liang, Zhongmin; Li, Yujie; Hu, Yiming; Li, Binquan; Wang, Jun] Hohai Univ, Coll Hydrol & Water Resources, 1 Xikang Rd, Nanjing, Jiangsu, Peoples R China",,"Liang, ZM (corresponding author), Hohai Univ, Coll Hydrol & Water Resources, 1 Xikang Rd, Nanjing, Jiangsu, Peoples R China.",zmliang@hhu.edu.cn,,,"National Key Research and Development Program of China [2016YFC0402706, 2016YFC0402707, 2016YFC0402709]","This study was supported by the National Key Research and Development Program of China (Grant Nos. 2016YFC0402706, 2016YFC0402707, and 2016YFC0402709).

In this study, a method was developed and applied to forecast the summer mass balance of Bruarjokull glacier in southeast Iceland. In the present study, many variables measured in the basin were evaluated, including glaciological snow accumulation data, various climate indices and meteorological measurements including temperature, humidity and radiation. The most relevant single predictor variables were selected using correlation analysis. The selected variables were used to define a set of potential multivariate linear regression models that were optimized by selecting an ensemble of plausible models showing good fit to calibration data. A mass-balance estimate was calculated as a uniform average across ensemble predictions. The method was evaluated using fivefold cross-validation and the statistical metrics Nash-Sutcliffe efficiency, the ratio of the root mean square error to the std dev. and percent bias. The results showed that the model produces satisfactory predictions when forced with initial condition data available at the beginning of the summer melt season, between 15 June and 1 July, whereas less reliable predictions are produced for longer lead times.","[Eythorsson, Darri; Gardarsson, Sigurdur M.] Univ Iceland, Fac Civil & Environm Engn, Hjardarhaga 2-6, IS-107 Reykjavik, Iceland; [Gunnarsson, Andri] Landsvirkjun, Res & Dev Div, Haaleitisbraut 68, IS-103 Reykjavik, Iceland; [Hrafnkelsson, Birgir] Univ Iceland, Fac Phys Sci, Dept Math, IS-107 Reykjavik, Iceland",,"Eythorsson, D (corresponding author), Univ Iceland, Fac Civil & Environm Engn, Hjardarhaga 2-6, IS-107 Reykjavik, Iceland.",dae5@hi.is,"Gardarsson, Sigurdur/A-6680-2008","Gardarsson, Sigurdur/0000-0002-4705-1572","University of Iceland Research Fund; Energy Research Fund of the National Energy Company, Landsvirkjun [MEI-03-2015, DOK-02-2017]","We thank the University of Iceland Research Fund which is supporting the first author.

However, their relative contribution to predictive skill remains unclear in China. In this study, we investigate the relative roles of ICs and CFs in cumulative runoff (CR) and soil moisture (SM) forecasts using 31-year (1980-2010) ensemble streamflow prediction (ESP) and reverse-ESP (revESP) simulations with the Variable Capacity Infiltration (VIC) hydrologic model. The results show that the relative importance of ICs and CFs largely depends on climate regimes. The influence of ICs is stronger in a dry or wet-to-dry climate regime that covers the northern and western interior regions during the late fall to early summer. In particular, ICs may dominate the forecast skill for up to three months or even six months during late fall and winter months, probably due to the low precipitation value and variability in the dry period. In contrast, CFs become more important for most of southern China or during summer months. The impact of ICs on SM forecasts tends to cover larger domains than on CR forecasts. These findings will greatly benefit future work that will target efforts towards improving current forecast levels for the particular regions and forecast periods.","[Zhang, Xuejun; Tang, Qiuhong; Liu, Xingcai; Li, Zhe; Huang, Zhongwei] Chinese Acad Sci, Inst Geog Sci & Nat Resources Res, Key Lab Water Cycle & Related Land Surface Proc, Beijing 100101, Peoples R China; [Tang, Qiuhong; Huang, Zhongwei] Univ Chinese Acad Sci, Beijing 100049, Peoples R China; [Leng, Guoyong] Pacific Northwest Natl Lab, Joint Global Change Res Inst, College Pk, MD 20740 USA",,"Tang, QH (corresponding author), Chinese Acad Sci, Inst Geog Sci & Nat Resources Res, Key Lab Water Cycle & Related Land Surface Proc, Beijing 100101, Peoples R China.; Tang, QH (corresponding author), Univ Chinese Acad Sci, Beijing 100049, Peoples R China.",zhangxj.13b@igsnrr.ac.cn; tangqh@igsnrr.ac.cn; guoyong.leng@pnnl.gov; xingcailiu@igsnrr.ac.cn; lizhe@igsnrr.ac.cn; huangzw.14b@igsnrr.ac.cn,"Liu, Xingcai/R-3510-2018; Tang, Qiuhong/ABA-2194-2021; Tang, Qiuhong/AAD-9832-2022","Liu, Xingcai/0000-0001-5726-7353; Tang, Qiuhong/0000-0002-0886-6699; Li, Zhe/0000-0003-3241-5641; Leng, Guoyong/0000-0001-6345-143X","National Natural Science Foundation of ChinaNational Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC) [41425002]; Chinese Postdoctoral Science FoundationChina Postdoctoral Science Foundation [2016M601117]; National Youth Top-notch Talent Support Program in China; Integrated Assessment Research program through the Integrated Multi-sector, Multiscale Modeling (IM3) Scientific Focus Area (SFA) - Biological and Environmental Research Division of Office of Science, U.S. Department of Energy; U.S. DOEUnited States Department of Energy (DOE) [DE-AC05-76RL01830]","Funding for this research is provided by the National Natural Science Foundation of China (41425002), Chinese Postdoctoral Science Foundation (2016M601117), and the National Youth Top-notch Talent Support Program in China.

The incorrect development of these wavelet-based forecasting models occurs during wavelet decomposition (the process of extracting high- and low-frequency information into different sub-time series known as wavelet and scaling coefficients, respectively) and as a result introduces error into the forecast model inputs. The source of this error is due to the boundary condition that is associated with wavelet decomposition (and the wavelet and scaling coefficients) and is linked to three main issues: 1) using 'future data' (i.e., data from the future that is not available); 2) inappropriately selecting decomposition levels and wavelet filters; and 3) not carefully partitioning calibration and validation data. By not addressing these boundary conditions during wavelet decomposition, incorrectly developed wavelet-based forecasting models often result in much better performance than what is realistically achievable. We demonstrate that the discrete wavelet transform (DWT) multiresolution analysis (DWT-MRA) and maximal overlap discrete wavelet transform (MODWT) multiresolution analysis (MODWT-MRA), two commonly adopted wavelet decomposition methods used in the development of hydrological and water resources wavelet-based forecasting models, suffer from these boundary conditions and cannot be used properly for real-world forecasting. However, by following a proposed set of best (correct) practices, we show that the MODWT and a trous algorithm (AT) can be used to correctly forecast target (e.g., hydrological and water resources) processes in real-world scenarios. In this vein, we contribute a set of best practices, which focusses on deriving boundary-corrected wavelet and scaling coefficients from time series data, overcoming the boundary condition issues and providing hydrological and water resources modellers with a justified and coherent strategy for developing wavelet-based forecasting models that may be used for real-world forecasting problems. We coalesce these best practices into a new forecasting framework named Wavelet Data-Driven Forecasting Framework (WDDFF) that uses a combination of input variable selection and data-driven models to convert boundary-corrected wavelet and scaling coefficients into forecasts of a target process. Through a real-world urban water demand forecasting experiment in Montreal, Canada, we demonstrate the superiority of WDDFF against benchmark forecasting models such as (non-wavelet-based) random walk, multiple linear regression, extreme learning machine, and second-order Volterra series models. For the same case study, we also show how the WDDFF provides realistic and accurate forecasts while a recently proposed wavelet-based forecasting model that adopts the (invalid) MODWT-MRA for wavelet decomposition provides incorrect and unrealistic forecasts. We conclude that WDDFF is a useful tool for forecasting real-world hydrological and water resources processes that overcomes the limitations of many earlier wavelet-based forecasting methods and should be explored further for forecasting different processes such as streamflow, rainfall, evaporation, etc.","[Quilty, John; Adamowski, Jan] McGill Univ, Dept Bioresource Engn, 21 111 Lakeshore Rd, Ste Anne De Bellevue, PQ H9X 3V9, Canada",,"Quilty, J (corresponding author), McGill Univ, Dept Bioresource Engn, 21 111 Lakeshore Rd, Ste Anne De Bellevue, PQ H9X 3V9, Canada.",johnmquilty@gmail.com,,,NSERC Discovery and Accelerator grants,"The authors are grateful to the Associate Editor and anonymous reviewers for their constructive comments that have significantly improved the quality of this work.

The main focus of this research is to understand the problem, including the aspects of settlement growth, forecasting, and proposing recommendations for expansion of the settlement areas. The study area is BWK II of Semarang City which consists of two Districts, Candisari and Gajahmungkur. The study area is a very potential area for settlement growth. The aim of the research was to predict the settlement growth and assess the location suitability of settlement growth based on the Master Plan document of Semarang City. The primary data for the study is obtained from QuickBird data image, and the spatial analysis was conducted by utilizing Remote Sensing, Geographic Information System, and LanduseSim as the software for prediction simulation. Accessibility and existing settlement location are considered as the driving factor while the river is considered as the constraint factor. The result of the study shows that the prediction of settlement growth is mostly consistent with the Master Plan of Semarang City. The study provides evidence that settlement growth was also observed in the conservation area and flood-prone area which are restricted for further development.

Despite the advances and progresses in Numerical Weather Prediction (NWP) models, they are still subject to many uncertainties, which cause significant errors forecasting precipitation. Statistical postprocessing techniques can improve forecast skills by reducing the systematic biases in NWP models. Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs) can model complex relationships between input and output data. The application of ANN in water-related research is widely studied; however, there is a lack of studies quantifying the improvement of coupled hydrometeorological model accuracy that use ANN for bias correction of real-time rainfall forecasts. The aim of this study is to evaluate the real-time bias correction of precipitation data, and from a hydrometeorological point of view, an assessment of hydrological model improvements in real-time flood forecasting for the Imjin River (South and North Korea) is performed. The comparison of the forecasted rainfall before and after the bias correction indicated a significant improvement in the statistical error measurement and a decrease in the underestimation of WRF model. The error was reduced remarkably over the Imjin catchment for the accumulated Mean Areal Precipitation (MAP).

Yet, users ask for more frequent forecasts and for more locations. Thus, ensuring the right consistency degree of the forecasts (still maintaining the quality of each forecast taken individually) became recently a major challenge for operational forecasting services. The notion of consistency encompasses several properties: (i) the spatio-temporal consistency of the forecasts issued at a given time on a river network, (ii) the right temporal structure of the forecast for the different lead times and (iii) the consistency of the successive forecasts during a flood event. The analysis focuses on two organizations with different flood forecasting contexts and objectives: the French electricity supplier EDF and the French public Flood Forecasting Services (Vigicrues network). Their forecasters teams are currently working with first tools in order to improve these consistencies. Some of these tools integrate the consistency issue into the hydrometeorological modelling while others facilitate the consideration of this issue in the forecaster's analysis. More applied research and development are still required. In addition to the technical challenge, increasing the number of forecasts issued calls for a controlled balance between the automation of the operational forecasting chain and the gain due to human expertise. Early reflections on forecasts consistency empha-size the utter importance of the human assessment and interpretation in order to achieve good forecasts and the need to position the forecaster well within the operational forecasting organization.","[Berthet, Lionel; Marty, Renaud] DREAL Ctr Val Loire, SPC LCI, Orleans, France; [Valery, Audrey; Garcon, Remy; Moulin, Laetitia; Puygrenier, Damien; Le Lay, Matthieu] Elect France, EDF, DTG, Paris, France; [Piotte, Olivier; Janet, Bruno; Duquesne, Francois] SCHAPI, DGPR, MTES, Paris, France",,"Berthet, L (corresponding author), DREAL Ctr Val Loire, SPC LCI, Orleans, France.",lionel.berthet@developpement-durable.gouv.fr; audrey.valery@edf.fr; remy.garcon@edf.fr; renaud.marty@developpement-durable.gouv.fr; laetitia.moulin@edf.fr; damien.puygrenier@edf.fr; olivier.piotte@developpement-durable.gouv.fr; mathieu.le-lay@edf.fr; bruno.janet@developpement-durable.gouv.fr; francois.duquesne@developpement-durable.gouv.fr,,,,,,15,1,1,1,12,TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD,ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OR14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0018-6368,1958-5551,,HOUILLE BLANCHE,Houille Blanche-Rev.

In general, the majority of the researchers emphasize forecasting on single output for a river system. The present study investigates the applicability and capability of coactive neuro-fuzzy inference system (CANFIS) for simultaneous river flow forecasting for a Barak river system in Assam, India. Besides, two other hybrid model approaches were developed by optimizing the parameters of CANFIS to adopt model's consistency toward achieving more precise and sensitive result which includes the combination of the CANFIS using genetic algorithm (CANFIS-GA) and CANFIS using firefly algorithm (CANFIS-FA). In total, 19,728 sets of recorded hourly concurrent flows data have been collected from different gauging sites pertaining to monsoon seasons. The results of the models (CANFIS, CANFIS-GA and CANFIS-FA) are evaluated, and the best-fit forecasting model(s) is determined using various statistical performance criterions. Also, this study witnessed the significant improvement in the quality of flow forecasting of traditional CANFIS when integrated using metaheuristics algorithms GA and FA. Besides, performance comparisons of the models are made using the artificial neural networks and probabilistics neural networks. In overall, results suggested that CANFIS-FA considerably improved upon other models and provides more better and accurate results for simultaneous flow forecasting in a river system.","[Tripura, Joseph] Natl Inst Technol, Dept Civil Engn, Hamirpur 177005, India; [Roy, Parthajit; Barbhuiya, A.

This work presents the results of a study to determine whether simple decline models can be used to forecast production and estimate reserves of both oil and gas in liquid rich shale (LRS) reservoirs with reasonable accuracy. We found that hybrid models (i.e., one model such as the Duong model for transient flow coupled with a different model, such as the Arps hyperbolic model with an appropriate value of the parameter b) are appropriate for forecasting oil production and that it is possible to forecast solution gas production with availability of adequate data. To establish the truth case for comparison, we simulated production with four different reservoir fluids using a commercial compositional reservoir simulator. We tested a variety of hybrid and simple DCA models on simulated data (and later on field data) with a work flow that included identifying flow regimes with diagnostic plots for each fluid sample. We analyzed 0.5-3 years of production history to estimate model parameters for forecasting future production. Also, we forecasted gas production using a technique similar to one recently presented in the literature. Lengthy transition periods between transient linear flow and boundary dominated flow (BDF) were observed on the diagnostic plots. This is presumably due to multi-phase flow effects, as this transition period is typically much shorter in single-phase shale reservoirs. As in single-phase flow, the Arps decline model proved to be good for forecasting in the BDF regime. For transient flow, we examined the Duong model which includes transient linear flow as a special case) and YM-SEPD (modified form of Stretched Exponential Production Decline model). In some cases, we applied the Arps model for both the transition period and BDF regimes (with different b values). We concluded that hybrid DCA models are more appropriate for multi-phase flow analysis than simple DCA models. In most of the cases, the hybrid YM-SEPD and Arps models led to more accurate oil production forecasts than other alternatives. Our analyses of solution gas forecasts indicated that solution gas production forecasting is possible but there is still need for more research in this area.","[Makinde, Ibukun; Lee, W.

The sign and magnitude of these changes depend on the complex interactions between the water, energy, and momentum budgets. To understand these changes, we use the weather research and forecasting (WRF) model with improved representation of groundwater dynamics and the added feature of Amazonian moisture tracers. The control simulation uses moderate resolution imaging spectroradiometer (MODIS) based observations of land use, and the deforestation simulations use a business-as-usual scenario projected for 2040-2050. Our results show that deforestation leads to changes that are seasonally very different. During the dry season, deforestation results in increased albedo and less available net radiation. This change, together with reduced leaf area, results in decreased evapotranspiration (ET), less atmospheric moisture of Amazonian origin, and an increase in temperature. However, we find no changes in precipitation over the basin. Conversely, during the wet season, surface winds increase significantly due to decreased surface roughness. Vapor transport increases throughout the deforested region and leads to an increase in easterly moisture export, and significant decrease in precipitation within the deforested regions of Eastern Amazon. Contrary to expectations, the moisture tracers in WRF show no evidence that precipitation decreases are due to recycling or changes in stability.","[Eiras-Barca, Jorge; Dominguez, Francina; Yang, Zhao; Chug, Divyansh] Univ Illinois, Dept Atmospher Sci, 3088A NHB, Urbana, IL 61801 USA; [Eiras-Barca, Jorge; Nieto, Raquel; Gimeno, Luis] Univ Vigo, CIM UVIGO, Environm Phys Lab EPhysLab, Orense, Spain; [Yang, Zhao] Pacific Northwest Natl Lab, Richland, WA 99352 USA; [Miguez-Macho, Gonzalo] Univ Santiago de Compostela, Nonlinear Phys Grp, Galicia, Spain",,"Eiras-Barca, J (corresponding author), Univ Illinois, Dept Atmospher Sci, 3088A NHB, Urbana, IL 61801 USA.",jeiras@uvigo.es,"Dominguez, Francina/AAH-6741-2020; GIMENO, LUIS/B-8137-2008; Eiras-Barca, Jorge/AAW-4756-2020","Eiras-Barca, Jorge/0000-0003-4401-5944; Miguez-Macho, Gonzalo/0000-0002-4259-7883; Chug, Divyansh/0000-0003-3891-7108","Spanish regional government Xunta de Galicia [ED4181B 2018/069]; Fulbright Commission (U.S. Department of State) [ED4181B 2018/069]; National Science Foundation (NSF) CAREER AwardNational Science Foundation (NSF)NSF - Office of the Director (OD) [AGS 1454089]; Future Investigators in the NASA Earth and Space Science and Technology (FINESST) 2019 Award; Ministerio de Ciencia, Innovacion y Universidades, Spain [RTI2018-095772-B-I00]; Xunta de GaliciaXunta de GaliciaEuropean Commission [ED431C 2017/64-GRC]","E.B. was supported by the program ED4181B 2018/069 from the Spanish regional government Xunta de Galicia and the Fulbright Commission (U.S. Department of State).

The leading EOF mode of spring precipitation over China (EOF1-prec) features a monosign pattern, with the maximum loading located over southern China. The ENSO-related tropical Pacific SST anomalies in the previous winter can serve as a precursor for EOF1-prec. The second EOF mode of spring precipitation (EOF2-prec) over China is characterized by a dipole structure, with one pole near the Yangtze River and the other one with opposite sign over the Pearl River delta. A North Atlantic sea surface temperature (SST) anomaly dipole in the preceding March is found contribute to the prec-EOF2 and can serve as its predictor. A physics-based empirical (P-E) model is then formulated using the two precursors revealed by the observational analysis to forecast the variations of EOF1-prec and EOF2-prec. Compared to coupled climate models, which have little skill in forecasting the time variations of the two EOF modes, this P-E model can significantly improve the forecast skill of their time variations. Alinear regression model is further established using the time series forecast by the P-E model to forecast the spring precipitation over China. Results suggest that the seasonal forecast skill of the spring precipitation over southeastern China, especially over the Yangtze River area, can be significantly improved by the regression model.","[You, YuJia; Jia, Xiaojing] Zhejiang Univ, Sch Earth Sci, Hangzhou, Zhejiang, Peoples R China",,"Jia, XJ (corresponding author), Zhejiang Univ, Sch Earth Sci, Hangzhou, Zhejiang, Peoples R China.",jiaxiaojing@zju.edu.cn,"You, Yujia/AAQ-6560-2020; You, Yujia/AAN-4444-2020","You, Yujia/0000-0002-3494-2456; You, Yujia/0000-0002-3494-2456","National Natural Science Foundation of ChinaNational Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC) [41475065, 41530425]; Fundamental Research Funds for the Central UniversitiesFundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities; training center of atmospheric sciences of Zhejiang University",This research was funded by National Natural Science Foundation of China (Grants 41475065 and 41530425) and by the Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities.

The tool was developed using hindcast data from 7 Global Climate Models (GCMs) and observed rainfall data from 49 meteorological surface observatories for the period of 1982 to 2011 from the Department of Meteorology and Hydrology. Based on the homogeneity in terms of the rainfall received annually, the country was divided into six climatological zones. Three different operational MME techniques, namely, (a) arithmetic mean (AM-MME), (b) weighted average (WA-MME), and (c) supervised principal component regression (PCR-MME), were used and built-in to the tool developed. For this study, all 7 GCMs were initialized with forecast data of May month to predict the rainfall during June to September (JJAS) period, which is the predominant rainfall season for Myanmar. The predictability of raw GCMs, bias-corrected GCMs, and the MMEs was evaluated using RMSE, correlation coefficients, and standard deviations. The probabilistic forecasts for the terciles were also evaluated using the relative operating characteristics (ROC) scores, to quantify the uncertainty in the GCMs. The results suggested that MME forecasts have shown improved performance (RMSE = 1.29), compared to the raw individual models (ECMWF, which is comparatively better among the selected models) with RMSE = 4.4 and bias-corrected RMSE = 4.3, over Myanmar. Specifically, WA-MME (CC = 0.64) and PCR-MME (CC = 0.68) methods have shown significant improvement in the high rainfall (delta) zone compared with WA-MME (CC = 0.57) and PCR-MME (CC = 0.56) techniques for the southern zone. The PCR method suggests higher predictability skill for the upper tercile (ROC = 0.78) and lower tercile categories (ROC = 0.85) for the delta region and is less skillful over lower rainfall zones like dry zones with ROC = 0.6 and 0.63 for upper and lower terciles, respectively.

Our analysis shows the potential of ARs in predicting extreme precipitation events at a daily scale, with Gilbert Skill Scores of similar to 0.2. Monthly extreme precipitation amount in west coast watersheds is closely related to AR intensity, with correlation coefficients of up to 0.6. The relationship between ARs and precipitation is most significant in the Pacific Northwest and California. Using a K-means clustering algorithm, ARs can be classified into three categories: weak ARs, flash ARs, and prolonged ARs. Flash ARs and prolonged ARs, though accounting for less than 50% of total AR events, are more important in controlling extreme precipitation patterns and should be prioritized for future studies of hydrological extreme events. Plain Language Summary Atmospheric rivers (ARs) are the elongated atmospheric bands that transport huge amount of water vapor toward the poles. Various studies have attributed ARs as a major cause of extreme precipitation and thus flooding in the western United States, but the reverse question is seldom investigated: when there is an AR, what is the likelihood of having an extreme precipitation event? In our study, we show that ARs can be used to predict the occurrence of extreme precipitation events at daily scale. We also show that the intensity of ARs is well correlated with extreme precipitation amount at a monthly scale. The results suggest that extreme precipitation prediction can potentially benefit from AR forecasts, which have a longer lead time than precipitation forecasts. Regarding the vast amount of ARs as identified from various AR-tracking algorithms, we used a machine learning-based approach to highlight ARs that are strongly correlated with hydrological extreme events. These ARs usually feature long duration or high intensity, and focusing on them may reveal a clearer and most robust relationship between ARs and hydrological extreme events.","[Chen, Xiaodong; Leung, L.

Forecasts of the anticipated runoff flows, created from radar extrapolation and/or numerical weather predictions, can potentially be used to optimize operation in both wet and dry weather periods. However, flow forecasts are inevitably uncertain and their use will ultimately require a trade-off between the value of knowing what will happen in the future and the probability and consequence of being wrong. In this study we examine how ensemble forecasts from the HIRLAM-DMI-S05 numerical weather prediction (NWP) model subject to three different ensemble post-processing approaches can be used to forecast flow exceedance in a combined sewer for a wide range of ratios between the probability of detection (POD) and the probability of false detection (POFD). We use a hydrological rainfall-runoff model to transform the forecasted rainfall into forecasted flow series and evaluate three different approaches to establishing the relative operating characteristics (ROC) diagram of the forecast, which is a plot of POD against POFD for each fraction of concordant ensemble members and can be used to select the weight of evidence that matches the desired trade-off between POD and POFD. In the first approach, the rainfall input to the model is calculated for each of 25 ensemble members as a weighted average of rainfall from the NWP cells over the catchment where the weights are proportional to the areal intersection between the catchment and the NWP cells. In the second approach, a total of 2825 flow ensembles are generated using rainfall input from the neighbouring NWP cells up to approximately 6 cells in all directions from the catchment. In the third approach, the first approach is extended spatially by successively increasing the area covered and for each spatial increase and each time step selecting only the cell with the highest intensity resulting in a total of 175 ensemble members. While the first and second approaches have the disadvantage of not covering the full range of the ROC diagram and being computationally heavy, respectively, the third approach leads to both a broad coverage of the ROC diagram range at a relatively low computational cost. A broad coverage of the ROC diagram offers a larger selection of prediction skill to choose from to best match to the prediction purpose. The study distinguishes itself from earlier research in being the first application to urban hydrology, with fast runoff and small catchments that are highly sensitive to local extremes. Furthermore, no earlier reference has been found on the highly efficient third approach using only neighbouring cells with the highest threat to expand the range of the ROC diagram. This study provides an efficient and robust approach to using ensemble rainfall forecasts affected by bias and misplacement errors for predicting flow threshold exceedance in urban drainage systems.

This paper develops a hybrid flood forecasting model that combines the flood hydrograph generalization method and random forest in the Qiushui River basin in the middle reaches of the Yellow River. The performance of this hybrid model is compared to that of the antecedent precipitation index model. For the development of these models, 23 flood events occurring from 1980 to 2010 are selected, of which 18 are used for calibration and 5 are used for validation. The results show that the hybrid model yields accurate predictions. And the comparison shows that the hybrid model performs better than the empirical model in the Qiushui River basin.

We illustrate this point with an example of the Logan River, Utah, originally populated with endemic cutthroat trout (Oncorhynchus clarkii utah), which compete with exotic brown trout (Salmo trutta). The coexistence equilibrium was disrupted by a large scale, experimental removal of the exotic species in 2009-2011 (on average, 8.2% of the stock each year), followed by an increase in the density of the native species. We built a spatially-explicit, reaction-diffusion model encompassing four key processes: population growth in heterogeneous habitat, competition, dispersal, and a management action. We calibrated the model with detailed long-term monitoring data (2001-2016) collected along the 35.4-km long river main channel. Our model, although simple, did a remarkable job reproducing the system steady state prior to the management action. Insights gained from the model independent predictions are consistent with available knowledge and indicate that the exotic species is more competitive; however, the native species still occupies more favorable habitat upstream. Dynamic runs of the model also recreated the observed increase of the native species following the management action. The model can simulate two possible distinct long-term outcomes: recovery or eradication of the exotic species. The processing of available knowledge using Bayesian methods allowed us to conclude that the chance for eradication of the invader was low at the beginning of the experimental removal (0.7% in 2009) and increased (20.5% in 2016) by using more recent monitoring data. We show that accessible mathematical and numerical tools can provide highly informative insights for managers (e.g., outcome of their conservation actions), identify knowledge gaps, and provide testable theory for researchers.","[Laplanche, Christophe; Elger, Arnaud; Santoul, Frederic] Univ Toulouse, UPS, EcoLab, CNRS,INPT, Toulouse, France; [Thiede, Gary P.; Budy, Phaedra] Utah State Univ, Dept Watershed Sci, Logan, UT 84322 USA; [Thiede, Gary P.; Budy, Phaedra] Utah State Univ, Ecol Ctr, Logan, UT 84322 USA; [Budy, Phaedra] US Geol Survey, Utah Cooperat Fish & Wildlife Res Unit, 959 Natl Ctr, Reston, VA 22092 USA",,"Laplanche, C (corresponding author), Univ Toulouse, UPS, EcoLab, CNRS,INPT, Toulouse, France.",christophe.laplanche@ensat.fr,,"Santoul, Frederic/0000-0002-2932-2172","Utah Division of Wildlife Resources; U.S. Forest Service, Rocky Mountain Research StationUnited States Department of Agriculture (USDA)United States Forest Service; U.S. Geological Survey Utah Cooperative Fish and Wildlife Research UnitUnited States Geological Survey; Ecology Center at Utah State University; INPT; Utah State University IACUC [2022]","The data collection component of this study was funded by the Utah Division of Wildlife Resources and the U.S. Forest Service, Rocky Mountain Research Station.

Recognizing both autocorrelation and heteroscedasticity inherent in the simulation errors of rainfall-runoff models, the autoregressive-generalized autoregressive conditional heteroscedasticity (AR-GARCH) model is introduced as a statistical postprocessing model of simulation errors in this study, in which the AR model is used to forecast the mean process of simulation errors, and the GARCH model to forecast the variance process of simulation errors. For investigating how well incorporating exogenous variables that contribute to heteroscedasticity improves update accuracy by comparing the GARCH model with and without exogenous variable, in this study, two rainfall-runoff models (one lumped and one distributed) have been chosen to simulate streamflow in three basins. Case studies show that (1) the AR-GARCH model with an exogenous variable showed advantages over AR-GARCH without exogenous variables through both increased forecast accuracy and reduced uncertainty during the validation period, and (2) more than 90% of error heteroscedasticity is due to the internal variable and less than 10% is due to the exogenous variable in this study. Only one exogenous variable was considered in this study, so further research is necessary to identify more exogenous variables which may have a greater contribution to simulate error heteroscedasticity. In conclusion, the developed AR-GARCH model with exogenous variables has the flexibility to deal with the characteristics of error series including autocorrelation and heteroscedasticity. Although the application of this study focused on streamflow forecasting, the developed methodology may be generalized and implemented in other applications to time-series data with complex errors.","[Zha, Xini; Xiong, Lihua; Guo, Shenglian; Kim, Jong-Suk; Liu, Dedi] Wuhan Univ, State Key Lab Water Resources & Hydropower Engn S, Wuhan 430072, Peoples R China",,"Xiong, LH (corresponding author), Wuhan Univ, State Key Lab Water Resources & Hydropower Engn S, Wuhan 430072, Peoples R China.",Xini_Zha@whu.edu.cn; xionglh@whu.edu.cn; slguo@whu.edu.cn; jongsuk@whu.edu.cn; dediliu@whu.edu.cn,"Kim, Jong-Suk/ABC-9255-2021","Kim, Jong-Suk/0000-0002-5274-5085; Zha, Xini/0000-0002-9675-0695","National Key R&D Program of China [2017YFC0405901]; National Natural Science Foundation of ChinaNational Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC) [41890822, 51525902]; Research Council of Norway (FRINATEK Project)Research Council of Norway [274310]; Ministry of Education Plan 111 Fund of China [B18037]","This study was supported by the National Key R&D Program of China (2017YFC0405901), the National Natural Science Foundation of China (Grant Nos. 41890822 and 51525902), the Research Council of Norway (FRINATEK Project 274310), and the Ministry of Education Plan 111 Fund of China (B18037), all of which are greatly appreciated.

Despite the scale of the issue, there is still a substantial lack of robust methods for scour prediction to support reliable, risk-based management and decision making. Throughout the past decade, the use of real-time scour monitoring systems has gained increasing interest among state departments of transportation across the U.S.A. This paper introduces three distinct methodologies for scour prediction using advanced artificial intelligence (AI)/machine learning (ML) techniques based on real-time scour monitoring data. Scour monitoring data included the riverbed and river stage elevation time series at bridge piers gathered from various sources. Deep learning algorithms showed promising in prediction of bed elevation and water level variations as early as a week in advance. Ensemble neural networks proved successful in the predicting the maximum upcoming scour depth, using the observed sensor data at the onset of a scour episode, and based on bridge pier, flow and riverbed characteristics. In addition, two of the common empirical scour models were calibrated based on the observed sensor data using the Bayesian inference method, showing significant improvement in prediction accuracy. Overall, this paper introduces a novel approach for scour risk management by integrating emerging AI/ML algorithms with real-time monitoring systems for early scour forecast.","[Yousefpour, Negin] Univ Melbourne, Arup, Melbourne, Vic, Australia; [Downie, Steve; Walker, Steve; Dikanski, Hristo] Arup, London, England; [Perkins, Nathan] Arup, Melbourne, Vic, Australia",,"Yousefpour, N (corresponding author), Univ Melbourne, Arup, Melbourne, Vic, Australia.",negin.yousefpour@unimelb.edu.au,,,Arup Global Research group/Arup University,"The author(s) disclosed receipt of the following financial support for the research, authorship, and/or publication of this article: This project was funded by Arup Global Research group/Arup University.",,38,0,0,4,4,SAGE PUBLICATIONS INC,THOUSAND OAKS,"2455 TELLER RD, THOUSAND OAKS, CA 91320 USA",0361-1981,2169-4052,,TRANSPORT RES REC,Transp.

Several researchers have fine-tuned the hydrological models by using pre-processed input data but improvement rate in prediction of daily time-step rainfall data is not up to the expected level. There are still chances to improve the accuracy of rainfall predictions with an efficient data preprocessing algorithm. Singular spectrum analysis (SSA) is one such technique found to be a very successful data pre-processing algorithm. In the past, the artificial neural network (ANN) model emerged as one of the most successful data-driven techniques in hydrology because of its ability to capture non-linearity and a wide variety of algorithms. This study aims at assessing the advantage of using SSA as a pre-processing algorithm in ANN models. It also compares the performance of a simple ANN model with SSA-ANN model in forecasting single time-step as well as multi-time-step (3-day and 7-day) ahead daily rainfall time series pertaining to Koyna watershed, India.

Moreover, the development of techniques for exploiting the information provided by satellite soil moisture to complement/enhance precipitation products have improved the accuracy of accumulated rainfall estimates over land. Such satellite enhanced precipitation products, available with a short latency (<1 day), represent an important and new source of information for river flow prediction and water resources management, particularly in developing countries in which ground observations are scarcely available and the access to such data is not always ensured. In this study, three recently developed rainfall products obtained from the integration of GPM rainfall and satellite soil moisture products have been used; namely GPM+SM2RAIN, PRISM-SMOS, and PRISM-SMAP. The prediction of observed daily river discharge at 10 basins located in Europe (4), West Africa (3) and South Africa (3) is carried out. For comparison, we have also considered three rainfall products based on: (1) GPM only, i.e., the Early Run version of the Integrated Multi-Satellite Retrievals for GPM (GPM-ER), (2) rain gauges, i.e., the Global Precipitation Climatology Centre, and (3) the latest European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts reanalysis, ERA5. Three different conceptual and lumped rainfall-runoff models are employed to obtain robust and reliable results over the 3-year data period 2015-2017. Results indicate that, particularly over scarcely gauged areas (West Africa), the integrated products outperform both ground- and reanalysis-based rainfall estimates. For all basins, the GPM+SM2RAIN product is performing the best among the short latency products with mean Kling-Gupta Efficiency (KGE) equal to 0.87, and significantly better than GPM-ER (mean KGE=0.77). The integrated products are found to reproduce particularly well the high flows. These results highlight the strong need to disseminate such integrated satellite rainfall products for hydrological (and agricultural) applications in poorly gauged areas such as Africa and South America.","[Brocca, Luca; Massari, Christian; Filippucci, Paolo; Ciabatta, Luca; Camici, Stefania] CNR, Res Inst Geohydrol Protect, Via Madonna Alta 126, I-06128 Perugia, Italy; [Pellarin, Thierry] Univ Grenoble Alpes, Grenoble INP, CNRS, IRD,IGE, F-38000 Grenoble, France; [Kerr, Yann H.] Univ Toulouse 3, CNRS, Ctr Etud Spatiales BIOsphere, CNES,IRD,INRA, Toulouse, France; [Fernandez-Prieto, Diego] European Space Agcy ESA, Frascati, Italy",,"Brocca, L (corresponding author), CNR, Res Inst Geohydrol Protect, Via Madonna Alta 126, I-06128 Perugia, Italy.",luca.brocca@irpi.cnr.it,"Filippucci, Paolo/AAA-8114-2022; Brocca, Luca/F-2854-2010; Massari, Christian/H-5037-2019","Filippucci, Paolo/0000-0003-4243-589X; Brocca, Luca/0000-0002-9080-260X; Massari, Christian/0000-0003-0983-1276; CAMICI, STEFANIA/0000-0002-5149-5395",European Space Agency ESAEuropean Space Agency [4000114738/15/I-SBo]; CNES program TOSCA,"This work is supported by the European Space Agency ESA (contract 4000114738/15/I-SBo) project SMOS+Rainfall Land II and by the CNES program TOSCA.

However, for operational applications, precipitation forecasts must go through bias correction in mean and spread. Although post-processing methods, such as BMA, have demonstrated good performance in ensemble-based calibration, the spatial correlation between stations may be altered after post-processing. In this research, ensemble precipitation forecasts of four NWP models, including ECMWF, UKMO, NCEP, and CMA within the TIGGE database, was bias-corrected and post-processed using quantile mapping and BMA for a case study basin in Iran. The ECC method was then used to recover the spatial correlation of ensemble forecasts. Subsequently, probabilistic streamflow forecast was conducted using post-processed precipitation forecasts. The results showed that the errors in the mean and spread of ensemble precipitation forecasts were corrected for each of the four NWP models while the ECC method was effective in maintaining spatial correlation. Furthermore, the results of probabilistic streamflow forecast showed that the performance of the forecast models improved after post processing, with the ECMWF model providing the best forecasts. More work is recommended to improve the impact of the ECC method on NWP models' performance.","[Aminyavari, Saleh] Islamic Azad Univ, Chalous Branch, Dept Civil Engn, Chalous, Iran; [Saghafian, Bahram] Islamic Azad Univ, Sci & Res Branch, Dept Civil Engn, Tehran, Iran",,"Saghafian, B (corresponding author), Islamic Azad Univ, Sci & Res Branch, Dept Civil Engn, Tehran, Iran.",b.saghafian@gmail.com,"Saghafian, Bahram/AAT-9822-2021; Aminyavari, Saleh/AAC-9892-2020","Aminyavari, Saleh/0000-0002-5319-2427",,,,40,6,6,3,8,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"ONE NEW YORK PLAZA, SUITE 4600, NEW YORK, NY, UNITED STATES",1436-3240,1436-3259,,STOCH ENV RES RISK A,Stoch.

The rapid expansion of linear developments such as roads, power lines will have an irreversible loss of habitat, as a result of forest fragmentation and consequent disruptions in the local ecological processes. The spatiotemporal land use analysis of Kodagu highlights the loss of forest cover due to an uncontrolled expansion of coffee plantations and other driving forces. The major cover of evergreen forest (40.47 to 27.14%) has lost due to interventions in terms of road, built-up areas and other changes. Around 66,892 ha of pristine forest cover was lost due to un-interrupted exploitation. Kushalnagara and Madikere taluks have lost the major chunk of forests due to construction (roads, homestays, villas, etc.) activities. Forest fragmentation analyses portray the status of forests in their condition across the temporal scale. The region had 32% of forest cover under interior or intact forests in 1973, whereas in 2018 it covers only 19% under various protected areas. Though Kodagu district is well connected with national and state high ways, the Government has now proposed to increase the road width of existing major highways (7) and a new railway line connecting Tellicherry and Mysore. The scenario based analysis has been done considering business as usual and with the expansion of linear alignments using Fuzzy-MCE-AHP-MCA. Forecasting future land use changes resulting from linear developments suggest the loss of core forest with the expansion of preexisting roads. The loss of 8% forest cover with the expansion of linear alignments will have irreversible impacts on Kodagu landscape. The study reveals the causal factors for the disaster are the absence of prudent management of a landscape in the ecologically fragile region evident from the conversion of native forests to other land uses, disruption of stream network, construction of buildings along the water course disrupting the natural water flow, construction or expansion of existing roads, steep vertical cuts leading to structural instability, removal of native vegetation cover in highly undulating terrains with steep slopes leading to the weakening of terrain due to the lowered binding capability of soil, encroachment of local water bodies (such as ponds/tanks), etc. The study emphasizes the need for restoration of stream network, catchment treatment through planting of native species, arresting deforestation and restrictions of large-scale developmental projects with the detrimental land use changes. The outcome of the current research helps in evolving appropriate policies to review the proposed linear projects towards sustainable management of natural resources.","[Ramachandra, T., V; Bharath, Setturu; Vinay, S.] Ctr Ecol Sci CES, Energy & Wetlands Res Grp, Bangalore, Karnataka, India; [Ramachandra, T., V] Ctr Sustainable Technol Astra, Bangalore, Karnataka, India; [Ramachandra, T., V] Indian Inst Sci, Ctr Infrastruct, Sustainable Transportat & Urban Planning CiSTUP, Bangalore 560012, Karnataka, India",,"Ramachandra, TV (corresponding author), Indian Inst Sci, Energy & Wetland Res Grp, Ctr Ecol Sci, ChS TE 15,New Biosci Bldg,Third Floor,Third Floor, Bangalore, Karnataka, India.",tvr@iisc.ac.in,,,"Coorg Wildlife Society; ENVIS division, the Ministry of Environment, Forests and Climate Change, Government of India","This researchwas supportedwith the grant fromCoorgWildlife Society and the ENVIS division, the Ministry of Environment, Forests and Climate Change, Government of India.

Qualitative and reliable drought forecasting is important worldwide for effective planning and decision-making in disaster-prone regions. Data-driven models have been extensively used for drought forecasting, but due to the inadequacy of information on model performance, the selection of an appropriate forecasting model remains a challenge. This study concerns a comparative analysis of six machine learning (ML) techniques widely used for hydrological drought forecasting. The standardized runoff index (SRI) was calculated at a seasonal (3-month) time scale for the period 1973 to 2016 in four selected watersheds of the Han River basin in South Korea. The ML models employed were built-ins, using precipitation, temperature, and humidity as input variables and the SRI as the target variable. The results indicated that all the ML models were able to map the relationship for seasonal SRI using the applied input vectors. The decision tree (DT) technique outperformed in all the watersheds with an average mean absolute error (MAE) = 0.26, root mean square error (RMSE) = 0.34, Nash-Sutcliffe efficiency (NSE) = 0.87, and coefficient of determination (R-2) = 0.89. The performances of the support vector machine (SVM) and deep learning neural network (DLNN) were similar, whereas the fuzzy rule-based system (FRBS) performed very well compared to the artificial neural network (ANN) and the adaptive neuro-fuzzy inference system (ANFIS). The overall findings of this study indicate that, considering performance criteria and computation time, the DT was the most accurate ML technique for hydrological drought forecasting in the Han River basin.

Traditional instruments for estimating raindrop size distribution (DSD), including disdrometers and ground dual-polarization radars, are available only in limited areas. However, the development of space-based radars and mesoscale numerical weather prediction models would allow for DSD estimation on a large scale. This study investigated the performance of the weather research and forecasting (WRF) model and the global precipitation measurement mission (GPM) dual-frequency precipitation radar for DSD retrieval under different conditions. The DSD parameters (D-m and N-w), rain rate (R), rainfall kinetic energy (KE) and radar reflectivity (Z) were estimated in Chilbolton, United Kingdom, by using long-term disdrometer observations for validation. The rainfall kinetic energy-rain rate (KE-R) and radar reflectivity-rain rate (Z-R) relationships were explored using a disdrometer, the WRF model and GPM. It was found that the DSD parameter distribution trends of the three approaches are similar although the WRF model has larger D-m and smaller N-w values. In terms of the rainfall microphysical relationship, GPM performs better when both Ku- and Ka-band precipitation radars (KuPR and KaPR) observe precipitation simultaneously (R > 0.5 mm h(-1)), while the WRF model shows high accuracy in light rain (R < 0.5 mm h(-1)). The fusion of GPM and WRF model is recommended for the improved understanding of rainfall microphysical characteristics in ungauged areas.","[Zhu, Jingxuan; Zhang, Shuliang; Yang, Qiqi; Shen, Qi; Dai, Qiang] Nanjing Normal Univ, Minist Educ, Key Lab VGE, Nanjing, Peoples R China; [Zhuo, Lu] Univ Sheffield, Dept Civil & Struct Engn, Sheffield, S Yorkshire, England; [Zhuo, Lu] Univ Bristol, Dept Civil Engn, Bristol, Avon, England",,"Yang, QQ (corresponding author), Nanjing Normal Univ, Minist Educ, Key Lab VGE, Nanjing, Peoples R China.",yangqiqi_gis@163.com,,"Zhu, Jingxuan/0000-0003-1559-3892; Zhuo, Lu/0000-0002-5719-5342","National Key R&D Program of China [2018YFB0505500, 2018YFB0505502]; National Natural Science Foundation of ChinaNational Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC) [41871299, 41771424, 42071364]","National Key R&D Program of China, Grant/Award Numbers: 2018YFB0505500, 2018YFB0505502; National Natural Science Foundation of China, Grant/Award Numbers: 41871299, 41771424, 42071364",,69,2,2,3,3,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",1350-4827,1469-8080,,METEOROL APPL,Meteorol.

However, the quality of CFSR data for running hydrological models in the Arctic is not well studied yet. This paper aims to compare the quality of CFSR data with ground-based data for hydrological modeling in an Arctic watershed, Malselv. The QSWAT model, a coupling of the hydrological model SWAT (soil and water assessment tool) and the QGIS, was applied in this study. The model ran from 1995 to 2012 with a 3-year warm-up period (1995-1997). Calibration (1998-2007), validation (2008-2012), and uncertainty analyses were conducted by the model for each dataset at five hydro-gauging stations within the watershed. The objective function Nash-Sutcliffe coefficient of efficiency for calibration is 0.65-0.82 with CFSR data and 0.55-0.74 with ground-based data, which indicate higher performance of the high-resolution CFSR data than the existing scattered ground-based data. The CFSR weather grid points showed higher variation in precipitation than the ground-based weather stations across the whole watershed. The calculated average annual rainfall by CFSR data for the whole watershed is approximately 24% higher than that by ground-based data, which results in some higher water balance components. The CFSR data also demonstrate its high capacities to replicate the streamflow hydrograph, in terms of timing and magnitude of peak and low flow. Through examination of the uncertainty coefficients P-factors (>= 0.7) and R-factors (<= 1.5), this study concludes that CFSR data are a reliable source for running hydrological models in the Arctic watershed Malselv.","[Bui, Minh Tuan; Lu, Jinmei] UiT Arctic Univ Norway, Dept Technol & Safety, Fac Sci & Technol, N-9037 Tromso, Norway; [Nie, Linmei] Fdn CSDI WaterTech, Ctr Sustainable Dev & Innovat Water Technol, N-0373 Oslo, Norway",,"Bui, MT (corresponding author), UiT Arctic Univ Norway, Dept Technol & Safety, Fac Sci & Technol, N-9037 Tromso, Norway.",minh.t.bui@uit.no,,,"Department of Technology and Safety, University of Tromso - The Arctic University of Norway; Research Council Project - Dissemination of climate change research outcomes in cold climate regions [321305]","The authors would like to acknowledge the Department of Technology and Safety, University of Tromso - The Arctic University of Norway, for their financial support and administration for this study.

Therefore, the present research's core objective is to create accurate and reliable machine learning models for irrigation parameters. To accomplish this determination, three machine learning (ML) models, viz. long short-term memory (LSTM), multi-linear regression (MLR), and artificial neural network (ANN), have been trained. It is validated with mean squared error (MSE) and correlation coefficients (r), root mean square error (RMSE), and mean absolute error (MAE). These machine learning models have been used and applied for predicating the six irrigation water quality parameters such as sodium absorption ratio (SAR), percentage of sodium (%Na), residual sodium carbonate (RSC), magnesium hazard (MH), Permeability Index (PI), and Kelly ratio (KR). Therefore, the two scenario performances of ANN, LSTM, and MLR have been developed for each model to predict irrigation water quality parameters. The first and second scenario performance was created based on all and second reduction input variables. The ANN, LSTM, and MLR models have discovered that excluding for ANN and MLR models shows high accuracy in first and second scenario models, respectively.

In this study, we aim to forecast and analyze fish catch by collaboratively processing data using methods at multiple scales. To this end, we propose two computational fishery catch forecasting models. A neural network model based on the multi-timescale features of a convolutional neural network and a long short-term memory neural network is proposed and implemented to forecast short-term measures for the daily catch in the eastern ports of Hokkaido, Japan. Similarly, we propose a long-term catch forecasting and analysis model combining the autoregressive integrated moving average (ARIMA) method and a neural network to explore short-term water temperature and long-term catch dependence in the case of sparse data; we implement this method to investigate the total monthly catch in Hokkaido. The experimental results demonstrate that the proposed methods were able to effectively forecast and analyze fishery catch based on different data scales, volumes, and other complex situations.

However, traditional methods have failed due to incorrect physics or complicated convolution from the well control history. In this research, we provide a physics-assisted analytics workflow using Laplacian Eigenmaps Coupled Echo-State Network (LEESN) to facilitate and accelerate the analysis of noisy historical production data. Pressure-rate deconvolution is an ill-posed, complex time-series problem. When using the traditional EchoState Network (ESN), the number of training sets is less than the number of neurons. To solve this problem, we apply LEESN to first deconvolve noisy variable-pressure variable-rate histories into smooth constant-pressure rate responses. The physics-based training features and training algorithm provide additional benefits in addition to the analytic approach by honoring transient flow physics. After training, the constant-pressure rate response can be predicted and used for reservoir characterization, and the trained model could be further used for production and EUR forecasting through long-term rate predictions to the economic limit. The proposed workflow was first validated by synthetic cases where the production data were obtained through simulation. The short-term flow rate history was obtained by specifying highly variable controlling pressures. We also added artificial white Gaussian noise to mimic measured signals collected in the field and input this information into LEESN for deconvolution. The constant-pressure rate response was generated after training to determine flow regimes and properties such as permeability using a traditional transient testing specialized plot. All outcomes from the analytics approach were validated by comparison against the input data of the synthetic simulation model. The advantages of the analytics approach were maintained with a moderate variation of noisy pressure-rate signals. For production forecasting, both the trained analytics model and simulator were used to predict for an extended period, and the results indicated good agreement between the response predictions. We performed a further sensitivity analysis on important parameters such as the training scale as well as the capability of Laplacian Eigenmaps handling moderate noise in training data. The comparison between the model predictions and simulation data showed significantly increased accuracy in production estimates. The efficacy was further demonstrated from additional single-phase and multiphase synthetic and field cases. This study shows that the LEESN approach is a powerful alternative to interpret pressure-rate-time information from production data. The discussion and comparison of LEESN with other traditional production analysis and forecast methods are included as well. Deconvolved pressure-rate data greatly enhances traditional rate-transient analysis (RTA) used to characterize reservoir parameters, and the trained model enables engineers to predict future production even with noisy, highly-variable production histories. The robustness of the proposed analytics methodology is strengthened by coupling the training features with transient flow physics and provides a unique approach for production analysis and forecasting for unconventional reservoirs.","[Pan, Yuewei] Texas A&M Univ, PetroChina Explorat & Prod Co, Hong Kong, Peoples R China; [Deng, Lichi] Texas A&M Univ, Quantum Reservoir Impact LLC, College Stn, TX 77843 USA; [Zhou, Peng] Texas A&M Univ, Counterparty Risk Anal Citigrp, College Stn, TX 77843 USA; [Lee, W.

During lake-effect snow events, the lake surfaces can cool rapidly, and in some cases, notable development of ice cover occurs. Such rapid changes in the lake-surface conditions are not accounted for in existing operational weather forecast models, such as the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration's (NOAA) High-Resolution Rapid Refresh (HRRR) model, resulting in reduced performance of lake-effect snow forecasts. As a milestone to future implementations in the Great Lakes Operational Forecast System (GLOFS) and HRRR, this study examines the one-way linkage between the hydrodynamic-ice model [the Finite-Volume Community Ocean Model coupled with the unstructured grid version of the Los Alamos Sea Ice Model (FVCOM-CICE), the physical core model of GLOFS] and the atmospheric model [the Weather Research and Forecasting (WRF) Model, the physical core model of HRRR]. The realistic representation of lake-surface cooling and ice development or its fractional coverage during three lake-effect snow events was achieved by feeding the FVCOM-CICE simulated lake-surface conditions to WRF (using a regional configuration of HRRR), resulting in the improved simulation of the turbulent heat fluxes over the lakes and resulting snow water equivalent in the downwind areas. This study shows that the one-way coupling is a practical approach that is well suited to the operational environment, as it requires little to no increase in computational resources yet can result in improved forecasts of regional weather and lake conditions.","[Fujisaki-Manome, Ayumi; Fitzpatrick, Lindsay E.] Univ Michigan, Cooperat Inst Great Lakes Res, Ann Arbor, MI 48109 USA; [Fujisaki-Manome, Ayumi; Wright, David M.] Univ Michigan, Climate & Space Sci & Engn, Ann Arbor, MI 48109 USA; [Mann, Greg E.] NOAA, Natl Weather Serv, Detroit Weather Forecast Off, White Lake, MI USA; [Anderson, Eric J.; Chu, Philip Y.] NOAA, Great Lakes Environm Res Lab, 2205 Commonwealth Blvd, Ann Arbor, MI 48105 USA; [Benjamin, Stanley G.; James, Eric P.; Smirnova, Tatiana G.; Alexander, Curtis R.] NOAA, Earth Syst Res Lab, Boulder, CO USA; [James, Eric P.; Smirnova, Tatiana G.] Univ Colorado, Cooperat Inst Res Environm Sci, Boulder, CO USA",,"Fujisaki-Manome, A (corresponding author), Univ Michigan, Cooperat Inst Great Lakes Res, Ann Arbor, MI 48109 USA.; Fujisaki-Manome, A (corresponding author), Univ Michigan, Climate & Space Sci & Engn, Ann Arbor, MI 48109 USA.",ayumif@umich.edu,"Benjamin, Stanley G/C-5818-2015; James, Eric/C-7713-2015; Fujisaki-Manome, Ayumi/AAA-5852-2021","Benjamin, Stanley G/0000-0002-5751-8236; James, Eric/0000-0002-6507-4997; Fujisaki-Manome, Ayumi/0000-0001-5466-6332; Anderson, Eric/0000-0001-5342-8383; Chu, Philip/0000-0002-3089-0353",NOAA Office of Weather and Air Quality Hydrometeorology Testbed; Cooperative Institute for Great Lakes Research (CIGLR) through the NOAACooperative Agreement; University of MichiganUniversity of Michigan System [NA12OAR4320071],"This study was funded by the NOAA Office of Weather and Air Quality Hydrometeorology Testbed, awarded to the NOAA Great Lakes Environmental Research Laboratory and the Cooperative Institute for Great Lakes Research (CIGLR) through the NOAACooperative Agreement with the University of Michigan (NA12OAR4320071).

This sub seasonal time scale is only recently motivated for research on applications, as it is often recognized as being in the gray zone of predictability in both meteorological and hydrological sciences. This work is one of the first assessments of ensemble sub seasonal meteorological inputs to large-scale basin hydrological modelling within a tropical climate - where it could benefit hydropower generation. The quantitative precipitation forecast (QPF) data were provided by the European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts (ECMWF), within the sub seasonal-to-seasonal (S2S) project's context. To assess the quality of the forecasts, a statistical evaluation was performed, including a comparison with the traditional extended streamflow prediction (ESP) technique. Results allowed for an estimation of the error magnitudes and the potential to the benefit of the ensemble over the deterministic reference forecast and the ESP approach. We showed that the sub seasonal QPF-based forecasts have advantages over the ESP, although, generally their skill deteriorates in lead times after day 30. The evaluation across multiple locations considering drainage area and hydrometeorological conditions, suggests that the statistical performance outcome is also spatio-temporal dependent.","[Quedi, Erik Schmitt; Fan, Fernando Mainardi] Univ Fed Rio Grande do Sul, Inst Pesquisas Hidraul, Av Bento Goncalves 9500, BR-90050260 Porto Alegre, RS, Brazil",,"Quedi, ES (corresponding author), Univ Fed Rio Grande do Sul, Inst Pesquisas Hidraul, Av Bento Goncalves 9500, BR-90050260 Porto Alegre, RS, Brazil.",erik.quedi@ufrgs.br,"Fan, Fernando Mainardi/I-2421-2019","Fan, Fernando Mainardi/0000-0003-0371-7851",CAPES - BrazilCoordenacao de Aperfeicoamento de Pessoal de Nivel Superior (CAPES),"The authors thank the two anonymous reviewers and Associate Editor Maria-Helena Ramos for the comments that helped to improve the paper.

Unlike the previous single-well analysis techniques, this new methodology tries to forecast the flow rates of a number of producing wells located in a certain neighborhood. It also takes into account the variety of flow rate patterns that may take place during the production period of the wells. Regarding the time-series nature of flow rate data and the spatial relationships between multiple wells in a proximity, the Space-Time Auto-Regressive Moving-Average technique, abbreviated as STARMA, is borrowed to employ in this research to capture the spatial inter-relationships of the wells and model the flow rate data of multiple wells simultaneously. Partitioning the field into different groups of adjacent wells based on the similarity of flow rate patterns is also recommended using the spatial clustering algorithms as an enhancing part of the proposed methodology. The capability of the proposed approach in forecasting the flow rates of multiple wells is verified using the real data of a case study including 38 active oil producing wells located in a reservoir in South West Iran. The forecasts generated by the proposed method are finally compared with the predictions obtained by the current ARIMA techniques. Based on findings of this research, the proposed space time modeling of multiple well flow rates helps in estimating the more accurate forecasts, when the single well analysis techniques fail in predicting the real trend of future flow rates.","[Ahmadi, Rouhollah; Aminshahidy, Babak] Amirkabir Univ Technol, Dept Petr Engn, Tehran Polytech, Tehran, Iran; [Shahrabi, Jamal] Amirkabir Univ Technol, Dept Ind Engn & Management Syst, Tehran Polytech, Tehran, Iran",,"Shahrabi, J (corresponding author), Amirkabir Univ Technol, Dept Ind Engn & Management Syst, Tehran Polytech, Tehran, Iran.",rouhollahahmadi@yahoo.com; jamalshahrabi@aut.ac.ir; aminshahidy@aut.ac.ir,,,,,,55,2,2,0,11,ELSEVIER,AMSTERDAM,"RADARWEG 29, 1043 NX AMSTERDAM, NETHERLANDS",0920-4105,1873-4715,,J PETROL SCI ENG,J.

Considering that most of the world's unfrozen freshwater reserves are stored in aquifers, the capability of prediction of spring discharges is a crucial issue. An approach based on water balance is often extremely complicated or ineffective. A promising alternative is represented by data-driven approaches. Recently, many hydraulic engineering problems have been addressed by means of advanced models derived from artificial intelligence studies. Three different machine learning algorithms were used for spring discharge forecasting in this comparative study: M5P regression tree, random forest, and support vector regression. The spring of Rasiglia Alzabove, Umbria, Central Italy, was selected as a case study. The machine learning models have proven to be able to provide very encouraging results. M5P provides good short-term predictions of monthly average flow rates (e.g., in predicting average discharge of the spring after 1 month, R2=0.991, RAE=14.97%, if a 4-month input is considered), while RF is able to provide accurate medium-term forecasts (e.g., in forecasting average discharge of the spring after 3 months, R2=0.964, RAE=43.12%, if a 4-month input is considered). As the time of forecasting advances, the models generally provide less accurate predictions. Moreover, the effectiveness of the models significantly depends on the duration of the period considered for input data. This duration should be close to the aquifer response time, approximately estimated by cross-correlation analysis.","[Granata, Francesco; Saroli, Michele; de Marinis, Giovanni; Gargano, Rudy] Univ Cassino & Southern Lazio, Dept Civil & Mech Engn, Via G Di Biasio 43, I-03043 Cassino, FR, Italy",,"Granata, F (corresponding author), Univ Cassino & Southern Lazio, Dept Civil & Mech Engn, Via G Di Biasio 43, I-03043 Cassino, FR, Italy.",f.granata@unicas.it,"Saroli, Michele MS/F-5132-2017","Saroli, Michele MS/0000-0001-9499-3960; GARGANO, Rudy/0000-0003-4409-9463; GRANATA, Francesco/0000-0002-2268-6600",,,,32,17,17,0,2,WILEY-HINDAWI,LONDON,"ADAM HOUSE, 3RD FL, 1 FITZROY SQ, LONDON, WIT 5HE, ENGLAND",1468-8115,1468-8123,,GEOFLUIDS,Geofluids,,2018,,,,,,,,,UNSP 8328167,10.1155/2018/8328167,,,13,Geochemistry & Geophysics; Geology,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),Geochemistry & Geophysics; Geology,HE9AM,WOS:000453739100001,,"Green Published, gold, Green Submitted",,,2022-02-17

In this study, we perform a multisite cascading ensemble assimilation of discharge and water temperature on the Nechako River (Canada) using particle filters. Hydrological and thermal initial conditions were provided to a rainfall-runoff model, coupled to a thermal module, using ensemble meteorological forecasts as inputs to produce 5 day ensemble thermal forecasts. Results show good performances of the particle filters with improvements of the accuracy of initial conditions by more than 65% compared to simulations without data assimilation for both the hydrological and the thermal component. All thermal forecasts returned continuous ranked probability scores under 0.8 degrees C when using a set of 40 initial conditions and meteorological forecasts comprising 20 members. A greater contribution of the initial conditions to the total uncertainty of the system for 1-dayforecasts is observed (mean ensemble spread = 1.1 degrees C) compared to meteorological forcings (mean ensemble spread = 0.6 degrees C). The inclusion, of meteorological uncertainty is critical to maintain reliable forecasts and proper ensemble spread for lead times of 2 days and more. This work demonstrates the ability of the particle filters to properly update the initial conditions of a coupled hydrological and thermal model and offers insights regarding the contribution of two major sources of uncertainty to the overall uncertainty in thermal forecasts.

This aim of this research was to predict the spatiotemporal development of water levels in a mined-out pit by generating forecasts of the dependent variables (rainfall and temperature) via linear (autoregressive integrated moving average) and non-linear (artificial neural network) models. We investigated natural water level development in one mined-out pit of the closed lignite mines in Amynteon, north Greece, with no artificial recharge. The forecasted rate of water level increase was estimated to be approximate to 10 m per year in the 'early' stage of pit lake spatiotemporal evolution (first 10 years), and 0.1 m per year in the 'last' stage of potential lake development (after year 2060). Also, the optimum lake surface (i.e. the level where no significant increase in water level rate appears) was estimated at + 520 m, which was predicted to occur in approximate to 40 years. The proposed methodology was validated via water level measurements performed during the first year of lake development, where field measurements of water elevations closely followed predictions. Forecasting pit lake water levels is essential for strategic planning, examining pit lake repurposing options, and informing decisions about post-mining futures and economic transitions.","[Louloudis, Georgios; Roumpos, Christos; Mertiri, Eleni; Kasfikis, Georgios; Chatzopoulos, Konstantinos] Publ Power Corp Greece, Dept Min Engn, Athens, Greece; [Louloudis, Emmanouil] Athens Univ Econ & Business, Dept Stat, Athens, Greece",,"Roumpos, C (corresponding author), Publ Power Corp Greece, Dept Min Engn, Athens, Greece.",g.louloudis@dei.gr; louloudis@aueb.gr; c.roumpos@dei.gr; elmertiri@gmail.com; g.kasfikis@dei.gr; k.chatzopoulos@dei.gr,,"Roumpos, Christos/0000-0001-9394-8041",,,,55,0,0,4,4,SPRINGER HEIDELBERG,HEIDELBERG,"TIERGARTENSTRASSE 17, D-69121 HEIDELBERG, GERMANY",1025-9112,1616-1068,,MINE WATER ENVIRON,Mine Water Environ.,,,,,,,,,,,,10.1007/s10230-021-00844-5,,DEC 2021,17,Water Resources,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),Water Resources,XI2EA,WOS:000725930600001,,,,,2022-02-17

Tracking the extent and efficacy of waterflooding (i.e., fluid distributions) is a primary task of reservoir engineers and is traditionally achieved by running full reservoir models. In this work, we design and implement a proxy model using a conditional deep convolutional generative neural network (cDC-GAN), which can be used to quickly calculate the dynamic fluid distribution of a heterogeneous reservoir under waterflooding. Zero-sum game theory is the basis for the cDC-GAN, which includes a pair of generative discriminative models. The generative model tries to learn the relationship between input and output and makes the generated output as close as possible to the training data, while the discriminative model tries to distinguish the fake output and the real data used for training, such that the cDC-GAN learns the real data distribution at the end. In our cDC-GAN formulation, the reservoir properties (permeability distribution in this research) and forecast time information are treated as input, and water saturation is the desired output. The reservoir fluid production rate can be calculated based on the material balance principle. The most significant contribution of this work resides in training a cDC-GAN proxy model to accurately predict fluid saturation. A cDC-GAN has several advantages over the traditional full-model based workflow. First, the model parameters estimated from history matching help to improve reservoir characterization. Second, this proposed proxy model can predict the water and oil saturation distributions simultaneously, which can be used to calculate the water and oil flow rates. Third, this proposed proxy model can be used for waterflooding optimization and uncertainty analysis with far less computational effort than with the traditional method, which uses a reservoir simulator.","[Zhong, Zhi] China Univ Geosci, Key Lab Tecton & Petr Resources, Minist Educ, Wuhan 430074, Hubei, Peoples R China; [Zhong, Zhi; Sun, Alexander Y.; Wang, Yanyong; Ren, Bo] Univ Texas Austin, Jackson Sch Geosci, Bur Econ Geol, Austin, TX 78758 USA",,"Zhong, Z; Sun, AY (corresponding author), Univ Texas Austin, Jackson Sch Geosci, Bur Econ Geol, Austin, TX 78758 USA.",zhongzhi@cug.edu.cn; alex.sun@beg.utexas.edu,"Wang, Yanyong/Q-4898-2017; Sun, Alexander/A-9959-2011","Wang, Yanyong/0000-0003-3119-3821; Sun, Alexander/0000-0002-6365-8526",Strategic Priority Research Program of the Chinese Academy of SciencesChinese Academy of Sciences [XDA14010302],"We are grateful to the AE and four anonymous reviewers for their constructive comments.

In some giant international companies, e.x. BP, about half of their production is by waterflooding. On the other hand, forecasting the performance of waterflooding projects plays an important role in successful study, design and selection of the best candidates from company reservoir asset. A model which is fast, robus, easy to use and reasonably accurate with a few input data required is of great desire. In this paper we address this deficiency by presenting a novel analytical-base forecasting model/tool that does not rely on conventional numerical simulation. Using the concepts of material balance, momentum balance, segregated flow and fractional flux (F-C or F-Phi) we achieve an analytical approach for modeling waterflooding behavior in reservoir. We used a Koval flow-storage capacity (F-C) model in the current research because of its strength and wide applicability for both homogenous and heterogeneous permeable media. The validity of the forecasting model was investigated by matching numerous actual field, single well and also simulation results. History matching showed good agreement between field data and forecasting results. The forecasting model demonstrates a strong ability to forecast the oil saturation, recovery efficiency, cumulative oil recovery, oil cut and oil rate changes with time. In addition, predicting the recovery efficiency enables us to generate the volumetric efficiency change with time which is of great importance for studying and evaluating waterflood process. These valuable results are produced using a few input data required.","[Mollaei, Alireza; Delshad, Mojdeh] Univ Texas Austin, Austin, TX 78712 USA",,"Mollaei, A (corresponding author), Univ Texas Austin, Austin, TX 78712 USA.",,,,Chevron alliance,The authors would like to acknowledge the Chevron alliance for support of this work.,,25,1,1,0,4,ELSEVIER SCI LTD,OXFORD,"THE BOULEVARD, LANGFORD LANE, KIDLINGTON, OXFORD OX5 1GB, OXON, ENGLAND",0016-2361,1873-7153,,FUEL,Fuel,FEB 1,2019,237,,,,,,298,307,,10.1016/j.fuel.2018.09.125,,,10,"Energy & Fuels; Engineering, Chemical",Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),Energy & Fuels; Engineering,GY4YB,WOS:000448573200029,,,,,2022-02-17

To avoid conflicts and reach an environmentally sustainable management, various methods have been devised to enable the participation of these actors. Mathematical modelling of river systems is highly recommended to forecast, but we do not always have enough information to do it. In these cases, the soft and meta-models can be valid alternatives to simulate these complex systems. The Fuzzy Cognitive Maps (FCMs) are presented as a tool that facilitates the modelling of ecological systems, functions and services. FCM networking concepts are intertwined through causal relationships. The FCM concept spatial arrangement and the use of fuzzy logic facilitate the integration of different expert opinions. In our study, from a panel of seven experts from representatives of different social sectors, an aggregated FCM was obtained. The most central concept in the aggregated map was cross barriers, dams and weirs. Using our FCM expert model, we performed a number of simulations from different possible scenarios, such as the continuous degradation of natural conditions and the improvement of river natural conditions. A regular increment in the natural conditions generates a substantial enhance in variables as natural water flow and sediment transport. Conversely, the increment in human activities as agro-forestry production addresses to a deterioration of river banks among other variables. In the Esla River, the FCM indicators showed an ecosystem that was greatly influenced by human activity, especially by the presence of barriers, in which the economic variables presented high network influence even though their centrality indices were relatively low. Meanwhile, the essential elements for the proper functioning of this ecosystem, as a natural flow regime, showed very low values that were visibly affected by anthropogenic variables. FCM methodology enabled us not only to understand the perception of current fluvial ecosystems but also to generate plausible management scenarios based on expert knowledge in this field.

The Atacama Desert is of particular interest as it is considered to be the driest region on Earth. We have performed simulations using the Weather Research and Forecasting (WRF) model over the Atacama Desert for two week-long periods in the austral winter season coincident with surface temperature and relative humidity in-situ observations at three sites. We found that the WRF model generally overestimates the daytime surface temperature, with biases of up to 11 degrees C, despite giving a good simulation of the relative humidity. In order to improve the agreement with observed measurements, we conducted sensitivity experiments in which the surface albedo, soil moisture content and five tuneable parameters in the Noah Land Surface Model (namely soil porosity, soil suction, saturated soil hydraulic conductivity, the b parameter used in hydraulic functions and the quartz fraction) are perturbed. We concluded that an accurate simulation is not possible, most likely because the Noah Land Surface Model does not have a groundwater table that may be shallow in desert regions. The WRF-predicted land surface temperature is also evaluated against that estimated from the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) instrument. While at night the satellite-derived and ground-based measurements are generally in agreement, during the day MODIS estimates are typically lower by as much as 17 degrees C. This is attributed to the large uncertainty in the MODIS-estimated land surface temperatures in arid and semi-arid regions. The findings of this work highlight the need for ground-based observational networks in remote regions such as the Atacama Desert where satellite-derived and model products may not be very accurate.","[Fonseca, Ricardo; Zorzano-Mier, Maria-Paz; Martin-Torres, Javier] Lulea Univ Technol, Dept Comp Sci Elect & Space Engn, Div Space Technol, S-97187 Lulea, Sweden; [Zorzano-Mier, Maria-Paz; Azua-Bustos, Armando] CSIC, INTA, Ctr Astrobiol, Madrid, Spain; [Azua-Bustos, Armando] Univ Autonoma Chile, Fac Ciencias Salud, Inst Ciencias Biomed, Santiago, Chile; [Gonzalez-Silva, Carlos] Univ Tarapaca, Fac Ciencias, Iquique, Chile; [Martin-Torres, Javier] CSIC, UGR, Inst Andaluz Ciencias Tierra, Granada, Spain",,"Fonseca, R (corresponding author), Lulea Univ Technol, Dept Comp Sci Elect & Space Engn, Div Space Technol, S-97187 Lulea, Sweden.",ricardo.fonseca@ltu.se,"Martin-Torres, Javier/M-3779-2019; Martin-Torres, Javier/G-6329-2015; Zorzano, María-Paz/F-2184-2015; González-Silva, Carlos/V-2681-2018; Azua-Bustos, Armando/R-1259-2017","Martin-Torres, Javier/0000-0001-6479-2236; Zorzano, María-Paz/0000-0002-4492-9650; González-Silva, Carlos/0000-0002-3917-2016; Azua-Bustos, Armando/0000-0002-6590-4145",Dubai Future Foundation [MBR023],"Dubai Future Foundation, MBR023",,99,11,11,1,10,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0035-9009,1477-870X,,Q J ROY METEOR SOC,Q.

In seasonal forecasting, global climate models (GCMs) are now the go-to source for rainfall forecasts. For hydrological applications however, GCM forecasts are often biased and unreliable in uncertainty spread, and calibration is therefore required before use. There are sophisticated statistical techniques for calibrating monthly and seasonal aggregations of the forecasts. However, calibration of seasonal forecasts at the daily time step typically uses very simple statistical methods or climate analogue methods. These methods generally lack the sophistication to achieve unbiased, reliable and coherent forecasts of daily amounts and seasonal accumulated totals. In this study, we propose and evaluate a Rainfall Post-Processing method for Seasonal forecasts (RPP-S), which is based on the Bayesian joint probability modelling approach for calibrating daily forecasts and the Schaake Shuffle for connecting the daily ensemble members of different lead times. We apply the method to post-process ACCESS-S forecasts for 12 perennial and ephemeral catchments across Australia and for 12 initialisation dates. RPP-S significantly reduces bias in raw forecasts and improves both skill and reliability. RPP-S forecasts are also more skilful and reliable than forecasts derived from ACCESS-S forecasts that have been post-processed using quantile mapping, especially for monthly and seasonal accumulations. Several opportunities to improve the robustness and skill of RPP-S are identified. The new RPP-S post-processed forecasts will be used in ensemble sub-seasonal to seasonal streamflow applications.","[Schepen, Andrew] CSIRO Land & Water, Dutton Pk, Qld 4102, Australia; [Zhao, Tongtiegang; Wang, Quan J.] Univ Melbourne, Dept Infrastruct Engn, Parkville, Vic 3010, Australia; [Robertson, David E.] CSIRO Land & Water, Clayton, Vic 3168, Australia",,"Schepen, A (corresponding author), CSIRO Land & Water, Dutton Pk, Qld 4102, Australia.",andrew.schepen@csiro.au,"Schepen, Andrew/AAG-8880-2020; Robertson, David/C-3643-2011; Wang, Quan J/D-2674-2012","Schepen, Andrew/0000-0002-6372-735X; Robertson, David/0000-0003-4230-8006; Wang, Quan J/0000-0002-8787-2738; Zhao, Tongtiegang/0000-0001-6943-258X",Water Information Research and Development Alliance (WIRADA); CSIROCommonwealth Scientific & Industrial Research Organisation (CSIRO); Bureau of MeteorologyBureau of Meteorology - Australia,"This research was supported by the Water Information Research and Development Alliance (WIRADA), a partnership between CSIRO and the Bureau of Meteorology.

In this context, state-of-the-art internet-of-things (IoT)-based sensing platforms are often employed to generate, pre-process and assimilate real-time data from heterogeneous sensors and streaming data sources. Simultaneously, Time-Series Forecasting Algorithms (TSFAs) are responsible for generating reliable forecasts with a pre-defined forecast horizon and confidence. These TSFAs often rely on modelling the correlation between endogenous variables, the impact of exogenous variables on latent form and structural properties of data such as autocorrelation, periodicity, trend, pattern, and causality to approximate the model parameters. Traditionally, TSFAs such as the Holt-Winters (HW) and Autoregressive family of models (ARIMA) apply a linear and parametric approach towards model approximation, whilst models like Support Vector Regression (SVRs) and Neural Networks (NNs) adhere to a non-linear, non-parametric approach for modelling the historical data. Recently, Deep-Learning-based TSFAs such as Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs), and Long-Short-Term-Memory (LSTMS) have gained popularity due to their capability to model long sequences of highly non-linear and stochastic data effectively. However, the evolution of TSFAs for predicting agrometeorological parameters pivots around one-step-ahead forecasting, which often overestimates the performance metrics defined for validating forecast capabilities of potential TSFAs. Hence, this paper attempts to evaluate and compare the performance of different machine learning (ML) and deep learning (DL) based TSFAs under one-step and multi-step-ahead forecast scenarios, thereby estimating the generalization capabilities of TSFA models over unseen data. The data used in this study are collected from an Automatic Weather Station (AWS), sampled at an interval of 15 min, and range over one month. Temperature (T) and Humidity (H) observations from the AWS are further converted into univariate, supervised time-series diurnal data profiles. Finally, walk-forward validation is used to evaluate recursive one-step-ahead forecasts until the desired prediction horizon is achieved. The results show that the Seasonal Auto-Regressive Integrated Moving Average (SARIMA) and SVR models outperform their DL-based counterparts in one-step and multi-step ahead settings with a fixed forecast horizon. This work aims to present a baseline comparison between different TSFAs to assist the process of model selection and facilitate rapid ahead-of-time forecasting for end-user applications.","[Suradhaniwar, Saurabh; Kar, Soumyashree; Durbha, Surya S.; Jagarlapudi, Adinarayana] Indian Inst Technol, Ctr Studies Resources Engn, Mumbai 400076, Maharashtra, India",,"Jagarlapudi, A (corresponding author), Indian Inst Technol, Ctr Studies Resources Engn, Mumbai 400076, Maharashtra, India.",saurabh.suradh@gmail.com; ksoumya2301@gmail.com; sdurbha@iitb.ac.in; adi@iitb.ac.in,,,,,,62,1,1,5,9,MDPI,BASEL,"ST ALBAN-ANLAGE 66, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND",,1424-8220,,SENSORS-BASEL,Sensors,APR,2021,21,7,,,,,,,2430,10.3390/s21072430,,,34,"Chemistry, Analytical; Engineering, Electrical & Electronic; Instruments & Instrumentation",Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Chemistry; Engineering; Instruments & Instrumentation,RL2ZK,WOS:000638847300001,33916026,"Green Published, gold",,,2022-02-17

Suspended sediments are a governing factor for the design and operation of hydraulic structures, like canals, diversions and dams. In recent decades, to model hydrological phenomena which are complex in nature the machine learning models are used commonly. In the present study, support vector machine (SVM) with wavelet transform (WASVM) has been employed for prediction of daily suspended sediment load (SL) for two south Indian watersheds (Marol and Muneru) using hydrometeorological data. A 40-year daily observed data (1972-2011) have been used for the analysis, where past SL, streamflow (Q), and rainfall (R) data were used as the model inputs, and SL was the model output. Using conventional correlation coefficient analysis between input and output variables, the best input of WASVM model was identified. The reliability of SVM and WASVM models were evaluated on the basis of different performance criteria, i.e.,coefficient of determination (R2), root mean square error (RMSE), normalized mean square error (NMSE), and Nash-Sutcliffe coefficient (NS). Initially, 1-day ahead SL prediction was performed using the best WASVM model. The results showed that, 1-day predictions were very precise, showing a close agreement with the observed SL data (R2=0.94, NS=0.94 for the Marol watershed, and R2=0.77, NS=0.77 for the Muneru watershed) in the testing period. The same WASVM model was then used for the prediction of SL for the higher lead periods. The NMSE value for the Marol watershed was found as low as 0.06 for 1-day ahead prediction, and increases subsequently as 0.29, 0.46, and 0.70 for 3-, 6-, and 9-day higher leads, respectively. Likewise, for the Muneru watershed, the NMSE value was found as low as 0.21 for 1-day ahead prediction, and increases subsequently as 0.42, 0.53, and 0.68 for 3-, 6-, and 9-day higher leads, respectively. Further, the model was evaluated on the basis of its capability of predicting peak SL and cumulative SL for 1- to 6-day leads. The statistical analysis shows that the developed WASVM model can predict the target value successfully up to a 6-day lead and is not suitable for higher lead specifically in the selected watersheds having similar hydroclimatic conditions like the ones selected in this study. Predictions by the WASVM model were found significantly superior to the ones obtained by the conventional SVM model. The results revealed that the WASVM model provides a very good accuracy in predicting SL and can be used as an effective forecasting tool for hydrological applications.","[Himanshu, Sushil Kumar; Pandey, Ashish] Indian Inst Technol Roorkee, Dept Water Resources Dev & Management, Roorkee 247667, Uttarakhand, India; [Yadav, Basant] Indian Inst Technol Delhi, Dept Civil Engn, New Delhi 110016, India",,"Himanshu, SK (corresponding author), Indian Inst Technol Roorkee, Dept Water Resources Dev & Management, Roorkee 247667, Uttarakhand, India.",sushilkumarhimanshu@gmail.com,"Yadav, Basant/AAE-5650-2019; Pandey, Ashish/O-9479-2018; Himanshu, Sushil Kumar/J-9642-2019","Yadav, Basant/0000-0001-9780-9030; Pandey, Ashish/0000-0003-2110-8283; Himanshu, Sushil Kumar/0000-0002-9384-4864",,,,72,17,17,1,44,ASCE-AMER SOC CIVIL ENGINEERS,RESTON,"1801 ALEXANDER BELL DR, RESTON, VA 20191-4400 USA",1084-0699,1943-5584,,J HYDROL ENG,J.

This paper proposes a B-spline quantile regression probability density prediction method to predict future runoff and quantify the uncertainty of prediction. The method includes three steps. First, the B-spline function is used to perform spline processing on the runoff data. Secondly, the spline-processed training data is input into the quantile regression model to calculate the parameters of the B-spline quantile regression model, and the successfully constructed B-spline quantile regression model is combined with kernel density estimation to construct a probability density prediction method. Finally, the constructed B-spline quantile regression probability density prediction method is used to forecast future runoff flow, and quantitatively analyze the relevant prediction uncertainty. Six evaluation indicators are constructed, among which the root mean square error, the deterministic coefficient, the pass rate are the evaluation metrics of point predictions based on probability mean, median and mode; the prediction interval coverage probability, prediction interval normalized average width and continuous ranked probability score are the evaluation criteria of interval predictions and probabilistic forecasting. The presented method is able to depict the probability density curve of future runoff flow, and obtain more comprehensive information than point forecasting and interval predictions. As a case study, this method is applicable to the Shigu station of the Jinsha River in China. The results show that the results of the proposed method are better than that of existing some state-of-the-art methods. From the perspective of application, the pass rate and the deterministic coefficient of the method have reached the grade A of accuracy. Therefore, the B-spline quantile regression model provides an alternative scheme to runoff prediction. (c) 2021 Elsevier Inc.

Simulation of soil water dynamics in field conditions becomes necessary to understand changes of soil water conditions to develop irrigation guidelines. In this study, three models including Auto Regressive Integrated Moving Average (ARIMA), Back Propagation Artificial Neural Network (BP-ANN), and Least Squares Support Vector Machine (LS-SVM) were used to simulate the soil water content in the 0-14 cm and 14-33 cm soil layers across the Taihu Lake region of China. Rainfall, evaporation, temperature, humidity and wind speed that affect soil water content changes were considered in the BP-ANN and LS-SVM, but not in ARIMA. The results showed that the variability of soil water content in 0-14 cm soil layer was greater than that in 14-33 cm. Correlation coefficients (r) of soil water content between simulations and observations were highest (0.9827) using LS-SVM in the 14-33 cm soil layer, while the lowest (0.7019) using ARIMA in the 0-14 cm soil layer; but no significant difference in r values was observed between the two soil layers with the BP-ANN model. Compared to other two models, the LS-SVM model seems to be more accurate for forecasting the dynamics of soil moisture. The results suggested that agro-climatic data can be used to predict the severity of soil drought stress and provide guidance for irrigation to increase crop production in the Taihu Lake region of China.","[Chen, Can; Lv, Qing; Tang, Qian] Nanjing Univ Informat Sci & Technol, Coll Appl Meteorol, Nanjing 210044, Peoples R China",,"Chen, C (corresponding author), Nanjing Univ Informat Sci & Technol, Coll Appl Meteorol, Nanjing 210044, Peoples R China.",chencan2010203@sohu.com,,,"Natural Science Foundation of ChinaNational Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC) [42107478]; Regional Innovation and Development Joint Fund of National Natural Science Foundation of ChinaNational Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC) [U20A2098]; Natural Science Foundation of Jiangsu Province, ChinaNatural Science Foundation of Jiangsu Province [BK 20150909]; State Key Laboratory of Soil and Sustainable Agriculture (Institute of Soil Science, Chinese Academy of Sciences)Chinese Academy of Sciences [Y20160038]; Foundation of Chinese postdoctoral [2016M591884]","The authors thank Dr Christopher Ogden for his checking of the English language and comments on this paper.

Recent innovations in machine learning provide powerful tools in exploring linear/nonlinear associations between climate variables. However, while it is hard to give physical interpretation of the more complex models, the simple models can be vulnerable to over-fitting, especially when dealing with the highly non-square climate data. Here, as a compromise of interpretability and complexity, we proposed a regression model by coupling pooling and a generalized regression with regularization. Performance of the model is tested in estimating the Three-Rivers Headwater Region wet-season precipitation using the sea surface temperatures at lead times of 0-24 months. The model shows better predictive skill for certain long lead times when compared with some commonly used regression methods including the Ordinary Least Squares (OLS), Empirical Orthogonal Function (EOF), and Canonical Correlation Analysis (CCA) regressions. The high skill is found to relate to the persistent regional correlation patterns between the predictand precipitation and predictor SSTs as also confirmed by a correlation analysis. Furthermore, flexibility of the model is demonstrated using a multinomial regression model which shows good skill around the long lead time of 22 months. Consistent clusters of SSTs are found to contribute to both models. Two SST indices are defined based on the major clusters of predictors and are found to be significantly correlated with the predictand precipitation at corresponding lead times. In conclusion, the proposed regression model demonstrates great flexibility and advantages in dealing with collinearity while preserving simplicity and interpretability, and shows potential as a cheap preliminary analysis tool to guide further study using more complex models.","[Peng, Xiao; Albertson, John D.] Cornell Univ, Sch Civil & Environm Engn, Ithaca, NY 14853 USA; [Li, Tiejian] Tsinghua Univ, Dept Hydraul Engn, Beijing, Peoples R China",,"Albertson, JD (corresponding author), Cornell Univ, Sch Civil & Environm Engn, Ithaca, NY 14853 USA.",albertson@cornell.edu,,,"Cornell China Center under the project of Food-Energy-Water Security in the Three-Rivers Headwater Region: Integrating Science, Data and Decision Tools to Manage Under a Changing Climate and Development Pressure; National Key Research and Development Program of China [2016YFE0201900]; Research Fund of the State Key Laboratory of Hydroscience and Engineering, Tsinghua University [2017-KY-04]","The Cornell authors were supported by the Cornell China Center under the project of Food-Energy-Water Security in the Three-Rivers Headwater Region: Integrating Science, Data and Decision Tools to Manage Under a Changing Climate and Development Pressure.

Potable water can be compromised due to a myriad of physical, operational, and environmental factors, such as contaminants intrusion into water pipelines, leaching, disinfection byproducts, chemical or microbial permeation, and pollution. The prediction of potable water quality has seldom been researched, while a novel automated model that offers a proactive approach can be developed to promote sustainability-based strategies. This paper elaborates the impacts of the aforementioned factors on the quality of potable water using the Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs) and risk analysis techniques. The ANN model was developed based on historical data obtained from the water distribution networks (WDNs) of the City of El Pedregal, Peru. The data were streamlined and fed to the neural network to be trained. Subsequent to multiple iterations via the scaled conjugate gradient algorithm, the optimized performance was generated and passed to the trained network to forecast the water quality failure in WDNs. The model performance was tested and validated against different statistical error terms and indicators. The mean absolute error and root-mean-squared error in the ANN failure prediction were computed as 0.08 and 0.15, whereas the average validity of the network was generated to be 92%. Based on the trained neural network, the degree of influence of each factor was determined through implementing a sensitivity analysis. It was found that water quality, water pressure, and operational and maintenance practices had the maximum influence on the risk of failure in water infrastructure. Policy makers and managers can benefit from the proposed model since ANN is already trained, by predicting water quality whenever new data become available. Prediction results will indicate the level of risk (low, moderate, high) to the inhabitants, thereby preemptive measures can be taken to avoid any illness or disease outbreak. (c) 2020 Elsevier Ltd.

It has been a forecasting challenge for the main US forecast models. This study investigates the ability of the Weather Research and Forecasting (WRF) model to improve upon forecasts, with particular emphasis on the rain shadow common to the southern end of the SFBA. Three rain events were evaluated: a mid-season atmospheric river (AR) event with copious rains; a typical non-AR frontal passage rain event; and an area-wide rain event in which zero rain was recorded in the southern SFBA. The results show that, with suitable choices of parameterizations, the WRF model with a resolution around 1 km can forecast the observed rainfall patterns with good accuracy, and would be suitable for operational use, especially to water and emergency managers. Additionally, the three synoptic situations were investigated for further insight into the common ingredients for either flooding rains or strong rain shadow events.","[Bridger, Alison F.

A quantification of its effect, though, on the contribution of the predictability sources to the forecast skill has not been previously investigated. In this work we apply the End Point Blending (EPB) framework to assess the contribution of IC and CF to the seasonal streamflow forecast skill over two catchments that represent the end members of a set of catchments of contrasting geology, hence contrasting hydrological response: a highly-permeable, hence slow-responding catchment and a fast-responding catchment of low permeability. Our results show that the contribution of IC in the slow-responding catchment is higher by up to 44% for forecasts initialized in winter and spring and by up to 21% for forecasts initialized in summer. IC are important for up to 4 months of lead in the slow-responding catchment and 2 months of lead in the flashier catchment. Our analysis highlights the added value of the EPB in comparison to the traditional ESP/revESP approach for identifying the sources of seasonal hydrological predictability, on the basis of catchment geology.","[Stergiadi, Maria; Di Marco, Nicola; Avesani, Diego; Righetti, Maurizio] Free Univ Bozen Bolzano, Fac Sci & Technol, Piazza Univ 5, I-39100 Bozen Bolzano, Italy; [Borga, Marco] Univ Padua, Dept Land Environm Agr & Forestry, Viale Univ 16, I-35020 Legnaro, Italy",,"Stergiadi, M; Avesani, D (corresponding author), Free Univ Bozen Bolzano, Fac Sci & Technol, Piazza Univ 5, I-39100 Bozen Bolzano, Italy.",maria.stergiadi@natec.unibz.it; nicola.dimarco@unibz.it; diego.avesani@unibz.it; maurizio.righetti@unibz.it; marco.borga@unipd.it,"; borga, marco/C-6697-2014","Avesani, Diego/0000-0002-0136-5672; borga, marco/0000-0003-3435-2779","project Applied Thermo-Fluid Dynamics Laboratories, Applied Research Infrastructures for Companies and Industry in South Tyrol [FESR1029]; European Regional Development Fund (ERDF) Investment for Growth and Jobs Program 2014-2020; Autonomous Province of BolzanoPronvincia Autonoma di Bolzano","The authors would like to acknowledge the Hydrographic Office of the Autonomous Province of Bozen-Bolzano for providing meteorological and streamflow data, as well as Maria-Helena Ramos (IRSTEA, France) and Ilias Pechlivanidis (SMHI, Sweden) for early discussions and suggestions on the present work.

Using the POD-3DEnVar method, a regional hybrid variational ensemble data assimilation system (referred to as POD-HVEDAS) is constructed with the Community Radiative Transfer Model (CRTM) as the observation operator. Observations from Microwave Humidity Sounder (MWHS) and Microwave Temperature Sounder (MWTS) onboard Fengyun3A are simultaneously assimilated into the Weather Research and Forecasting (WRF) model by the POD-HVEDAS. Bias correction and quality control schemes for MWHS and MWTS microwave radiance are applied in the system. Three experiments (Con, Hybrid-DA, and POD-DA) are designed to investigate the assimilation ability of the POD-HVEDAS for heavy rainfall over the Yangtze River. The assimilation effects of POD-3DEnVar and WRFDA-Hybrid assimilation method are compared. The results show that the POD-HVEDAS can assimilate MWHS and MWTS microwave radiance effectively, and give a better precipitation forecast than that of the WRFDA-Hybrid method. And it is found that the assimilation increments of both POD-3DEnVar and WRFDA-Hybrid methods all show flow dependent characteristic. However, the improvements in the background wind, temperature and humidity fields by the POD-DA experiment are more obvious than those of the Hybrid-DA experiment, which play key roles in improving the accuracy of precipitation forecast. These promising results suggest initiulizing limited-area models with POD-3DEnVar method that assimilate microwave radiances is beneficial. In the future, POD-3DEnVar method will be used to study multiple cases to fully assess the robustness of POD-HVEDAS.","[Zhang, Mingyang; Zhang, Lifeng; Guan, Jiping; You, Wei] Natl Univ Def Technol, Coll Meteorol & Oceanog, Nanjing 211101, Jiangsu, Peoples R China; [Zhang, Bin] PLA, Unit 61741, Beijing 100094, Peoples R China",,"Zhang, LF (corresponding author), Natl Univ Def Technol, Coll Meteorol & Oceanog, Nanjing 211101, Jiangsu, Peoples R China.",Zhariglif_qxxy@sina.cn,"You, Wei/L-7114-2016",,"Beijige Open Research Fund for Nanjing Joint Center of Atmospheric Research [NJCAR2018ZD03]; National Natural Science Foundation of ChinaNational Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC) [41775123,41805092]","This work was supported by the Beijige Open Research Fund for Nanjing Joint Center of Atmospheric Research (NJCAR2018ZD03), by the National Natural Science Foundation of China (41775123,41805092).",,56,6,6,3,22,ELSEVIER SCIENCE INC,NEW YORK,"STE 800, 230 PARK AVE, NEW YORK, NY 10169 USA",0169-8095,1873-2895,,ATMOS RES,Atmos.

One of the ways to reduce CO2 emissions to the atmosphere by the Power Industry in Poland may be the method recommended in the document of the Ministry of Energy, Innovation for Energy - directions of energy innovation development 2017 [9], where it is stated that the development of CO2 capture and utilization technology - CCU (Carbon Capture and Utilization) is desirable. In many countries [7, 8], it has been shown that the technology of CO2 injection into oil and gas reservoirs is a mature technology that could be one of the significant opportunities for CO2 utilization in the processes of oil and gas recovery. Also in Poland, during the last twenty years, two small acid gas injection installations have been implemented into the gas and oil reservoirs, admittedly small, but they have shown the potential for technical possibilities in this respect in our industry. The presented article discusses the research results obtained as part of a project implemented by the consortium of Oil and Gas Institute and Polish Geological Institute - National Research Institutes and commissioned by the Ministry of Environment [6], in which the first methodical assessment of potential additional oil and gas recovery was carried out in CO2-EOR/EGR processes, (Enhanced Oil, Gas Recovery). For the selected 6 oil and 4 gas reservoirs, the most prospective from the point of view of CO2-EOR/EGR technology in the land area of Poland, geological and reservoirs analyzes, computer and laboratory simulations as well as preliminary analysis of the economic effectiveness were carried out. The calculations show a relatively small increase of gas recovery. In the case of oil reservoirs, the effects of the EOR method discussed here are much higher, and the increase in the recovery of resources on average exceeds 30%. These results for subsequent reservoirs are strongly diversified due to the current level of depletion, the nature of the method (secondary or third), energy mechanisms (water activity flowing into the reservoirs) and other reservoir and drilling factors (density of well grid). A quantitative assessment of CO2 sequestration capacity in 10 selected oil and gas reservoirs was also performed. The sequestration was carried out as part of extended enhanced oil/gas recovery by CO2 injection. Preliminary analysis of economic viability were made for two variants of adopted scenarios differentiating the costs of CO2 supply, based on material models, simulation results and the history and forecasts of the exploitation of reservoirs. It has been shown that the use of CO2 in EOR projects to increase the recovery from discovered and developed reservoirs, especially of oil, could be in the near future one of the most significant areas of Polish oil exploitation, allowing to obtain additional significant amounts of crude oil recovery and additional profits from trading in CO2 emission allowances.","[Lubas, Jan] Panstwowy Inst Badawczy, Inst Nafty & Gazu, Eksploatacji Zloz Weglowodorow, Ul Lubicz 25 A, PL-31503 Krakow, Poland; [Lubas, Jan] Panstwowy Inst Badawczy, Inst Nafty & Gazu, Krosnienskiego Oddzialu INiG PIB, Ul Lubicz 25 A, PL-31503 Krakow, Poland",,"Lubas, J (corresponding author), Panstwowy Inst Badawczy, Inst Nafty & Gazu, Eksploatacji Zloz Weglowodorow, Ul Lubicz 25 A, PL-31503 Krakow, Poland.; Lubas, J (corresponding author), Panstwowy Inst Badawczy, Inst Nafty & Gazu, Krosnienskiego Oddzialu INiG PIB, Ul Lubicz 25 A, PL-31503 Krakow, Poland.",jan.lubas@inig.pl,,,,,,11,1,1,1,2,INST OIL & GAS,KRAKOW,"UL LUBICZ 25 A, KRAKOW, 31503, POLAND",0867-8871,,,NAFT-GAZ,Naft.-Gaz,DEC,2018,74,12,,,,,944,950,,10.18668/NG.2018.12.09,,,7,"Engineering, Petroleum",Emerging Sources Citation Index (ESCI),Engineering,HN4IT,WOS:000460148300009,,,,,2022-02-17

Therefore, the objective of this study was to forecast the SPI (Standard Precipitation Index) and SPEI (Standard Precipitation Evapotranspiration Index) drought indices for 14 meteorological stations in the Fuerte River watershed in northwest Mexico. Our hypothesis was that it is possible to achieve such objective through the implementation of the Discrete Kalman filter algorithm (DKF). The Fuerte River watershed, Sinaloa, Mexico, is important for its agricultural production and generation of hydroelectric power. We did the forecast of the SPI and SPEI drought indices for time scales (drought durations) of 3, 6,12 and 24 months, during the period 1961-2011, and with 1, 2, 3 and 4 months in advance. Two models were implemented using the Discrete Kalman filter: a second-order autoregressive (DKF-AR2), and a second-order autoregressive with exogenous input (DKF-ARX). The climatic variables tested as exogenous were precipitation (Pt), maximum and minimum temperatures (Tmax and Tmin) and reference evapotranspiration (ET0); the exogenous variable precipitation, Pt, recorded better results. The DKF-AR2 methodology presented the best result in the forecast of the indices for six stations located in the upper part of the watershed, with predominance of temperate and semi-cold climates. The DKF-ARX-Pt methodology proved better in the remaining eight stations of the middle and lower parts, located in warm climates. The best forecasts were obtained for scales (drought durations) of 12 and 24 months, and the SPEI forecast was better than that of SPI. The Nash-Sutcliffe indices (E) for 12 and 24 months reached up to 0.92 and 0.96; in the case of 3 and 6 months, the Nash-Sutcliffe indices were approximately 0.5. The anticipation of the prognosis was better for 1 and 2 months.","[Castillo-Castillo, Monica; Ibanez-Castillo, Laura A.; Arteaga-Ramirez, Ramon; Vazquez-Pena, Mario A.] Univ Autonoma Chapingo, Ingn Agr & Uso Integral Agua, Chapingo 56230, Estado De Mexic, Mexico; [Valdes, Juan B.] Univ Arizona Tucson, Dept Hydrol & Water Resources, Tucson, AZ USA",,"Castillo-Castillo, M (corresponding author), Univ Autonoma Chapingo, Ingn Agr & Uso Integral Agua, Chapingo 56230, Estado De Mexic, Mexico.",libacas@gmail.com,"Ibanez-Castillo, Laura/AAQ-8460-2021",,,,,30,1,1,0,2,COLEGIO POSTGRADUADOS,MONTECILLO,"CARRETERA MEXICO TEXCOCO KM 36 5, MONTECILLO 56230, ESTADO MEXICO, MEXICO",1405-3195,,,AGROCIENCIA-MEXICO,Agrociencia,OCT-NOV,2018,52,7,,,,,911,932,,,,,22,"Agriculture, Multidisciplinary",Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),Agriculture,HA8QR,WOS:000450558000001,,,,,2022-02-17

Satellite precipitation data are used to force VIC for a near-real-time estimate of land surface hydrologic conditions. Initialized with satellite-aided monitoring (MONIT), the climate model (CFSv2)-based forecast (MONIT+CFSv2) and ensemble streamflow prediction (ESP)-based forecast (MONIT+ESP) are both performed. One dry season drought and one wet season drought are employed to test the ability of this framework in terms of real-time tracking and predicting the evolution of soil moisture (SM) drought, respectively. The results show that the skillful CFSv2 climate forecasts (CFs) are only found at the first month. The satellite-aided monitoring is able to provide a reasonable estimate of forecast initial conditions (ICs) in real-time mode. In the presented cases, MONIT+CFSv2 forecast exhibits comparable performance against the observation-based estimates for the first month, whereas the predictive skill largely drops beyond 1 month. Compared to MONIT+ESP, MONIT+CFSv2 ensembles give more skillful SM drought forecast during the dry season, as indicated by a smaller ensemble range, while the added value of MONIT+CFSv2 is marginal during the wet season. A quantitative attribution analysis of SM forecast uncertainty demonstrates that SM forecast skill is mostly controlled by ICs at the first month and that uncertainties in CFs have the largest contribution to SM forecast errors at longer lead times. This study highlights a value of this framework in generating near-real-time ICs and providing a reliable SM drought prediction with 1 month ahead, which may greatly benefit drought diagnosis, assessment, and early warning.","[Zhang, Xuejun; Tang, Qiuhong; Liu, Xingcai; Li, Zhe] Chinese Acad Sci, Key Lab Water Cycle & Related Land Surface Proc, Inst Geog Sci & Nat Resources Res, Beijing, Peoples R China; [Zhang, Xuejun] Univ Chinese Acad Sci, Beijing, Peoples R China; [Leng, Guoyong] Pacific Northwest Natl Lab, Joint Global Change Res Inst, College Pk, MD USA",,"Tang, QH (corresponding author), Chinese Acad Sci, Key Lab Water Cycle & Related Land Surface Proc, Inst Geog Sci & Nat Resources Res, Beijing, Peoples R China.",tangqh@igsnrr.ac.cn,"Liu, Xingcai/R-3510-2018; Tang, Qiuhong/ABA-2194-2021; Tang, Qiuhong/AAD-9832-2022","Liu, Xingcai/0000-0001-5726-7353; Tang, Qiuhong/0000-0002-0886-6699; Leng, Guoyong/0000-0001-6345-143X; Li, Zhe/0000-0003-3241-5641",,,,72,36,37,0,45,AMER METEOROLOGICAL SOC,BOSTON,"45 BEACON ST, BOSTON, MA 02108-3693 USA",1525-755X,1525-7541,,J HYDROMETEOROL,J.

Here we assess our current understanding of the causes of coastal SL variability on monthly to multi-decadal timescales, including geodetic, oceanographic and atmospheric aspects of the problem, and review available observing systems informing on coastal SL. We also review the ability of existing models and data assimilation systems to estimate coastal SL variations and of atmosphere-ocean global coupled models and related regional downscaling efforts to project future SL changes.

However, considering that the number of forecasting factors is numerous, a single forecasting model has certain limitations and a runoff time series consists of complex nonlinear and nonstationary characteristics, which make the runoff forecasting difficult. Aimed at improving the prediction accuracy of annual runoff time series, the principal components analysis (PCA) method is adopted to reduce the complexity of forecasting factors, and a modified coupling forecasting model based on multiple linear regression (MLR), back propagation neural network (BPNN), Elman neural network (ENN), and particle swarm optimization-support vector machine for regression (PSO-SVR) is proposed and applied in the Dongbei Hydrological Station in the Ganjiang River Basin. Firstly, from two conventional factors (i.e., rainfall, runoff) and 130 atmospheric circulation indexes (i.e., 88 atmospheric circulation indexes, 26 sea temperature indexes, 16 other indexes), principal components generated by linear mapping are screened as forecasting factors. Then, based on above forecasting factors, four forecasting models including MLR, BPNN, ENN, and PSO-SVR are developed to predict annual runoff time series. Subsequently, a coupling model composed of BPNN, ENN, and PSO-SVR is constructed by means of a multi-model information fusion taking three hydrological years (i.e., wet year, normal year, dry year) into consideration. Finally, according to residual error correction, a modified coupling forecasting model is introduced so as to further improve the accuracy of the predicted annual runoff time series in the verification period.","[Song, Peibing; Wang, Hao] Zhejiang Univ, Coll Civil Engn & Architecture, Hangzhou 310058, Peoples R China; [Liu, Weifeng] Hohai Univ, Coll Hydrol & Water Resources, Nanjing 210098, Peoples R China; [Sun, Jiahui] Shandong Univ, Sch Civil Engn, Jinan 250061, Peoples R China; [Wang, Chao; Lei, Xiaohui; Wang, Hao] China Inst Water Resources & Hydropower Res, State Key Lab Simulat & Regulat Water Cycle River, Beijing 100038, Peoples R China; [Kong, Lingzhong] Yangzhou Univ, Coll Hydraul Sci & Engn, Yangzhou 225009, Jiangsu, Peoples R China; [Nong, Zhenxue] Guangxi Elect Power Design & Res Inst Co Ltd, China Energy Construct Grp, Nanning 530007, Peoples R China",,"Wang, C (corresponding author), China Inst Water Resources & Hydropower Res, State Key Lab Simulat & Regulat Water Cycle River, Beijing 100038, Peoples R China.",songpeibing@zju.edu.cn; wangchao@iwhr.com,,,National Natural Science Foundation of ChinaNational Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC) [51709275]; Young Elite Scientists Sponsorship Program by CAST [2019QNRC001]; Fundamental Research Funds of IWHR [WR0145B012020]; National Key Research and Development Plan of China [2018YFC0407405],"This research was funded by the National Natural Science Foundation of China (51709275), the Young Elite Scientists Sponsorship Program by CAST (2019QNRC001), the Fundamental Research Funds of IWHR (WR0145B012020), and the National Key Research and Development Plan of China (2018YFC0407405).",,51,5,5,11,22,MDPI,BASEL,"ST ALBAN-ANLAGE 66, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND",,2073-4441,,WATER-SUI,Water,AUG,2020,12,8,,,,,,,2086,10.3390/w12082086,,,19,Environmental Sciences; Water Resources,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),Environmental Sciences & Ecology; Water Resources,NH4AZ,WOS:000564615500001,,gold,,,2022-02-17

Recently, with improvements to computation systems and resources, data-driven models have shown good performances for runoff forecasting. However, the relative performance of common data-driven models using small temporal resolutions is still unclear. This study presents an application of data-driven models using artificial neural network, support vector regression and long-short term memory approaches and distributed forcing data for runoff predictions between 2010 and 2019 in the Russian River basin, California, USA. These models were used to predict hourly runoff with 1-6 h of lead time using precipitation, soil moisture, baseflow and land surface temperature datasets provided from the North American Land Data Assimilation System. The predicted results were evaluated in terms of seasonal and event-based performance using various statistical metrics. The results showed that the long-short term memory and support vector regression models outperforms artificial neural network model for hourly runoff forecasting, and the predictive performance of the models was greater during the wet seasons compared to the dry seasons. In addition, a comparison of the data-driven model results with the National Water Model, a fully distributed physical-based hydrologic model, showed that the long-short term memory and support vector regression models provide comparable performance. The results demonstrate that data-driven models for hourly runoff forecasting are sufficiently predictive and useful in areas where observation systems are not available.","[Han, Heechan; Morrison, Ryan R.] Colorado State Univ, Dept Civil & Environm Engn, Ft Collins, CO 80523 USA",,"Morrison, RR (corresponding author), Colorado State Univ, Dept Civil & Environm Engn, Ft Collins, CO 80523 USA.",Ryan.Morrison@colostate.edu,"; Morrison, Ryan/K-8333-2013","Han, Heechan/0000-0002-4078-0967; Morrison, Ryan/0000-0002-8612-1684",,,,50,4,4,6,20,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"ONE NEW YORK PLAZA, SUITE 4600, NEW YORK, NY, UNITED STATES",1436-3240,1436-3259,,STOCH ENV RES RISK A,Stoch.

The aim of the study is to identify and assess the primary research areas of hydrocarbon reservoirs in pre-Jurassic basement by the example of underexplored areas of the Ust-Tym mega-depression and structures of the Nurol'ka mega-depression which are located on the well-developed oilfield infrastructure areas of Tomsk region. Object of study is the potential pre-Jurassic reservoirs of Permo-Triassic weathering crust and Paleozoic basement. The accumulations of weathering crust are associated with reservoirs formed on clay and siliceous, carbonate and acid volcanic rocks, and, under certain conditions, by ultrabasites. The reservoirs of bedrock are associated with secondary reservoirs formed by limestones, granites, rhyolites. The main oil source formation is the Lower-Jurassic Togur sediments. The study is carried out based on the concept of mainly vertical hydrocarbon migration. The research area is located in boundaries of the oil source formation. Thermal history reconstruction of oil source formation, cumulatively taking into account the temperatures of the localized source kitchen, is carried out by solving the direct and inverse problems of geothermy. The studies are based on a special technology that includes an integrated analysis of mapping results of the Togur oil source kitchen by the geotemperature criterion and predicting mapping of the weathering crust and the Paleozoic basement reservoirs according to the data of deep drilling, oil geological zoning and perspective areas ranking. In the territory of the Ust-Tym megadepression as the primary research area for the weathering crust reservoir the zone of the northeastern side of the megadepression has been selected. As the priority area for exploration of Paleozoic basement reservoirs the zone uniting the north-eastern slope of North-Parabel megamonocline and the adjacent southern part of Pyzhinsk mesodepression has been selected. As the perspective research area for the weathering crust reservoir the land of the south beads of Kulan-Igay and Tamrad basins and its adjacent areas for the territory of Nurol'ka megadepression have been identified. As the priority areas for research and development of Paleozoic basement reservoirs the south beads of Kulan-Igay basin and adjacent zone of Tamrad basin have been identified, as well as the lands of the south-eastern beads of Nurol'ka megadepression and the adjacent lands of Chuzik-Chizhap mesosaddle. The reliability of the forecast for perspective areas of the pre-Jurassic petroleum play is identified by comparison with the results of well testing and is about 70-80 %. It argues the previously formulated resource-efficient strategy and technology of exploration for oil deposits in the pre-Jurassic basement of Western Siberia.","[Lobova, G. A.; Isaev, V.

These errors stem, in part, from the calculation of horizontal gradients within the diffusion term of the momentum or scalar evolution equations. In WRF, such gradients can be calculated along coordinate surfaces, or using metric terms that help account for grid skewness. However, neither of these options ensures a truly horizontal gradient calculation, especially if a grid cell is skewed enough that the heights of the neighboring grid points used in the calculation fall outside the vertical range of the cell. In this work, an improved scheme that uses Taylor series approximations to vertically interpolate variables to the level necessary for a truly horizontal gradient calculation is implemented in WRF for the diffusion of potential temperature. The scheme is validated using an atmosphere-at-rest configuration, in which spurious flows develop only as a result of numerical errors and can thus be used as a proxy for model performance. Following validation, the method is applied to the simulation of cold-air pools (CAPs), which occur in regions of complex terrain and are characterized by strong near-surface temperature gradients. Using the truly horizontal scheme, idealized simulations demonstrate reduced numerical mixing in a quiescent CAP, and a realistic case study in the Columbia River basin shows a reduction in positive wind speed bias by up to roughly 20% compared to observations from the Second Wind Forecast Improvement Project.","[Arthur, Robert S.; Lundquist, Katherine A.] Lawrence Livermore Natl Lab, Livermore, CA 94550 USA; [Olson, Joseph B.] NOAA, Global Syst Lab, Boulder, CO USA",,"Arthur, RS (corresponding author), Lawrence Livermore Natl Lab, Livermore, CA 94550 USA.",arthur7@llnl.gov,"Arthur, Robert S./AAU-7834-2021; Olson, Joseph/N-3726-2014","Arthur, Robert S./0000-0002-3861-4185; Olson, Joseph/0000-0003-3612-0808","LLNL [DE-AC52-07NA27344]; U.S. Department of Energy (DOE), Office of Energy Efficiency and Renewable Energy (EERE), Wind Energy Technologies Office (WETO)United States Department of Energy (DOE); National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA)/Earth System Research Laboratories (ESRL) Atmospheric Science for Renewable Energy (ASRE) Program","Prepared by LLNL under Contract DE-AC52-07NA27344.

The challenge of analyzing streaming data for real-time prediction can be overcome by exploiting deep learning techniques. Taking this as a motivation, this work aims to integrate big data technologies and deep learning techniques to develop a real-time data stream processing model for vehicle traffic forecast using ensemble learning approach. Real-time traffic data from an API is streamed using a distributed streaming platform called Kafka into Apache Spark where it is processed, and the traffic flow is predicted by a neural network ensemble model.

The BCC_AGCM2.2 model shows some skill in predicting summer rainfall over eastern China within the lead-times of 0-9 days. However, the subseasonal prediction skill is low on average, which is linked to the ability of the model in predicting the western Pacific subtropical high (WPSH). The low prediction skills may partially be attributed to biases in the model, including a wider meridional span and a weaker intensity of rainbelt in Yangtze River valley, earlier meridional movement, and a further northward shift of WPSH compared to that in the observations. These biases result in an obvious dry bias along the monsoon rainbelt, and a wet bias to both the north and south sides. Moreover, as a major contributor to the predictability, the Pacific-Japan pattern is not well predicted for both its spatial pattern and subseasonal evolution. The low forecast skill of summer rainfall in eastern China seems due to a dominant role of the atmospheric internal variability and a minor influence of the sea surface temperature in extratropical climate variability.

Particularly for flash flood forecasting in tropical mountainous watersheds, forecast precipitation is required to provide timely warnings. This paper aims to assess the potential of NWP for flood early warning purposes, and the possible improvement that bias correction can provide, in a tropical mountainous area. The paper focuses on the comparison of streamflows obtained from the post-processed precipitation forecasts, particularly the comparison of ensemble forecasts and their potential in providing skilful flood forecasts. The Weather Research and Forecasting (WRF) model is used to produce precipitation forecasts that are post-processed and used to drive a hydrologic model. Discharge forecasts obtained from the hydrological model are used to assess the skill of the WRF model. The results show that post-processed WRF precipitation adds value to the flood early warning system when compared to zero-precipitation forecasts, although the precipitation forecast used in this analysis showed little added value when compared to climatology. However, the reduction of biases obtained from the post-processed ensembles show the potential of this method and model to provide usable precipitation forecasts in tropical mountainous watersheds. The need for more detailed evaluation of the WRF model in the study area is highlighted, particularly the identification of the most suitable parameterisation, due to the inability of the model to adequately represent the convective precipitation found in the study area.","[Rogelis, Maria Carolina; Werner, Micha] UNESCO IHE, POB 3015, NL-2601 DA Delft, Netherlands; [Werner, Micha] Deltares, POB 177, NL-2600 MH Delft, Netherlands",,"Rogelis, MC (corresponding author), UNESCO IHE, POB 3015, NL-2601 DA Delft, Netherlands.",c.rogelisprada@unesco-ihe.org,"Werner, Micha/C-8144-2009","Werner, Micha/0000-0003-4198-5638",UNESCO-IHE Partnership Research Fund - UPARF,"This work was funded by the UNESCO-IHE Partnership Research Fund - UPARF in the framework of the FORESEE project.

Here we try to better understand the spatiotemporal dynamics of Amazonia droughts and associated climate teleconnections as characterized by the Palmer Drought Severity Index (PDSI), which integrates information from rainfall deficit, temperature anomalies, and soil moisture capacity. The results reveal that Amazonia droughts are most related to one dominant pattern across the entire region, followed by two seesaw kind of patterns: north-south and east-west. The main two modes are correlated with sea surface temperature (SST) anomalies in the tropical Pacific and Atlantic oceans. The teleconnections associated with global SST are then used to build a seasonal forecast model for PDSI over Amazonia based on predictors obtained from a sparse canonical correlation analysis approach. A unique feature of the presented drought prediction method is using only a few number of predictors to avoid excessive noise in the predictor space. Cross-validated results show correlations between observed and predicted spatial average PDSI up to 0.60 and 0.45 for lead times of 5 and 9 months, respectively. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study in the region that, based on cross-validation results, leads to appreciable forecast skills for lead times beyond 4 months. This is a step forward in better understanding the dynamics of Amazonia droughts and improving risk assessment and management, through improved drought forecasting.","[Lima, Carlos H.

Here we explore whether inclusion of temperature forcing in a model depicting WNV transmission improves WNV forecast accuracy relative to a baseline model depicting WNV transmission without temperature forcing. Both models are optimized using a data assimilation method and two observed data streams: mosquito infection rates and reported human WNV cases. Each coupled model-inference framework is then used to generate retrospective ensemble forecasts of WNV for 110 outbreak years from among 12 geographically diverse United States counties. The temperature-forced model improves forecast accuracy for much of the outbreak season. From the end of July until the beginning of October, a timespan during which 70% of human cases are reported, the temperature-forced model generated forecasts of the total number of human cases over the next 3 weeks, total number of human cases over the season, the week with the highest percentage of infectious mosquitoes, and the peak percentage of infectious mosquitoes that on average increased absolute forecast accuracy 5%, 10%, 12%, and 6%, respectively, over the non-temperature forced baseline model. These results indicate that use of temperature forcing improves WNV forecast accuracy and provide further evidence that temperature influences rates of WNV transmission. The findings provide a foundation for implementation of a statistically rigorous system for real-time forecast of seasonal WNV outbreaks and their use as a quantitative decision support tool for public health officials and mosquito control programs.","[DeFelice, Nicholas B.; Little, Eliza; Shaman, Jeffrey] Columbia Univ, Mailman Sch Publ Hlth, Dept Environm Hlth Sci, New York, NY 10027 USA; [Schneider, Zachary D.] Columbia Univ, Mailman Sch Publ Hlth, Dept Epidemiol, New York, NY USA; [Barker, Christopher] Univ Calif Davis, Ctr Vectorborne Dis, Davis, CA 95616 USA; [Caillouet, Kevin A.] St Tammany Parish, St Tammany Parish Mosquito Abatement Dist, Slidell, LA USA; [Campbell, Scott R.] Yaphank, Suffolk Cty Dept Hlth Serv, Arthropod Borne Dis Lab, New York, NY USA; [Damian, Dan; Townsend, John] Maricopa Cty Environm Serv Dept, Vector Control Div, Phoenix, AZ USA; [Irwin, Patrick] Northwest Mosquito Abatement Dist, Wheeling, IL USA; [Jones, Herff M.

Before the occurrence of rainstorm, the signals of weather forecasts in this case are too weak to be predicted by numerical weather model, but the surface temperature over the urban area are high. The results of this study show that the wind field, temperature, and water vapor are obviously adjusted by assimilating surface data of 10-rn wind, 2-m temperature, and 2-m water vapor mixing ratio at 2300 BST 6 May, especially below the height of 2 km. The southerly wind over the Pearl River Delta region is enhanced, and the convergence of wind over the northern Guangzhou city is also enhanced. Additionally, temperature, water vapor mixing ratio and pseudoequivalent potential temperature are obviously increased over the urban region, providing favorable conditions for the occurrence of heavy precipitation. After assimilation, the predictions of 12-h rainfall amount, temperature, and relative humidity arc significantly improved, and the rainfall intensity and distribution in this case can be successfully reproduced. Moreover, sensitivity tests suggest that the assimilation of 2-m temperature is the key to predict this extreme rainfall and just assimilating data of surface wind or water vapor is not workable, implying that urban heat island effect may be an important factor in this extreme rainstorm.","[Xiao Hui; Wan Qi-lin; Liu Xian-tong; Zheng Teng-fei; Feng Lu; Xia Feng] CMA, Guangzhou Inst Trop & Marine Meteorol, Guangzhou 510641, Guangdong, Peoples R China; [Chen Jing-hua] Nanjing Univ Informat Sci & Technol, Nanjing 210044, Jiangsu, Peoples R China",,"Wan, QL (corresponding author), CMA, Guangzhou Inst Trop & Marine Meteorol, Guangzhou 510641, Guangdong, Peoples R China.",qlwan@gd121.cn,,,"National Key Basic Research and Development (973) Program of ChinaNational Basic Research Program of China [2015CB452802]; National Natural Science Foundation of ChinaNational Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC) [41705120, 41705020, 41705118]; National Science and Technology Program [2017YFC1501701]; Guangdong Province Science and Technology Project [2015B020217001, 2017E3020244002]","National Key Basic Research and Development (973) Program of China (2015CB452802); National Natural Science Foundation of China (41705120, 41705020, 41705118); National Science and Technology Program (2017YFC1501701); Guangdong Province Science and Technology Project (2015B020217001, 2017E3020244002)",,24,5,6,3,10,JOURNAL  OF TROPICAL METEOROLOGICAL PRESS,GUANGZHOU,"6 FU JIN RD, GUANGZHOU, 510080, PEOPLES R CHINA",1006-8775,,,J TROP METEOROL,J.

To explore the better application of time-frequency decomposition technology in runoff forecasting and improve the prediction accuracy, this research has developed a framework of runoff forecasting named Decomposition-Integration-Prediction (DIP) using parallel-input neural network, and proposed a novel runoff forecasting model with Variational Mode Decomposition (VMD), Gated Recurrent Unit (GRU), and Stochastic Fractal Search (SFS) algorithm under this framework. In this model, the observed runoff series is first decomposed into several sub-series via the VMD method to extract different frequency information. Secondly, the parallel layers in the parallel-input neural network based on GRU are trained to receive the input samples of each subcomponent and integrate their output adaptively through the concatenation layers. Finally, the output of concatenation layers is treated as the final runoff forecasting result. In this process, the SFS algorithm was adopted to optimize the structure of the neural network. The prediction performance of the proposed model was evaluated using the historical monthly runoff data at Pingshan and Yichang hydrological stations in the Upper Yangtze River Basin of China, and seven various single and decomposition-based hybrid models were developed for comparison. The results show that the proposed model has obvious advantages in overall prediction performance, model training time, and multi-step-ahead prediction compared to several comparative methods, which is a reasonable and more efficient monthly runoff forecasting method based on time series decomposition and neural networks.","[Xu, Zhanxing; Zhou, Jianzhong; Mo, Li; Jia, Benjun; Yang, Yuqi; Fang, Wei; Qin, Zhou] Huazhong Univ Sci & Technol, Sch Civil & Hydraul Engn, Wuhan 430074, Peoples R China; [Xu, Zhanxing; Zhou, Jianzhong; Mo, Li; Jia, Benjun; Yang, Yuqi; Fang, Wei; Qin, Zhou] Hubei Key Lab Digital Valley Sci & Technol, Wuhan 430074, Peoples R China",,"Zhou, JZ (corresponding author), Huazhong Univ Sci & Technol, Sch Civil & Hydraul Engn, Wuhan 430074, Peoples R China.; Zhou, JZ (corresponding author), Hubei Key Lab Digital Valley Sci & Technol, Wuhan 430074, Peoples R China.",zhanxing@hust.edu.cn; jz.zhou@hust.edu.cn; moli@hust.edu.cn; jbj@hust.edu.cn; yangyuqi@hust.edu.cn; d202081169@hust.edu.cn; qinzhou@hust.edu.cn,,,"Key Program of the National Natural Science Foundation of ChinaNational Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC) [U1865202,52039004]","FundingThis paper is supported by the Key Program of the National Natural Science Foundation of China, grant number U1865202,52039004.",,58,0,0,1,1,MDPI,BASEL,"ST ALBAN-ANLAGE 66, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND",,2073-4441,,WATER-SUI,Water,DEC,2021,13,23,,,,,,,3390,10.3390/w13233390,,,21,Environmental Sciences; Water Resources,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),Environmental Sciences & Ecology; Water Resources,XU9VK,WOS:000734602900001,,,,,2022-02-17

We present here the method and its formulation, along with details of the implementation into WRF. We perform an in-depth validation with a 1-month long simulation over North America at 20 km resolution, tagging all possible moisture sources: lateral boundaries, continental, maritime or lake surfaces and initial atmospheric conditions. We estimate errors as the moisture or precipitation amounts that cannot be traced back to any source. Validation results indicate that the method exhibits high precision, with errors considerably lower than 1% during the entire simulation period, for both precipitation and total precipitable water. We apply the method to the Great Lake-effect snowstorm of November 2014, aiming at quantifying the contribution of lake evaporation to the large snow accumulations observed in the event. We perform simulations in a nested domain at 5 km resolution with the tagging technique, demonstrating that about 30-50% of precipitation in the regions immediately downwind, originated from evaporated moisture in the Great Lakes. This contribution increases to between 50 and 60% of the snow water equivalent in the most severely affected areas, which suggests that evaporative fluxes from the lakes have a fundamental role in producing the most extreme accumulations in these episodes, resulting in the highest socioeconomic impacts.","[Insua-Costa, Damian; Miguez-Macho, Gonzalo] Univ Santiago Compostela, Nonlinear Phys Grp, Galicia, Spain",,"Insua-Costa, D; Miguez-Macho, G (corresponding author), Univ Santiago Compostela, Nonlinear Phys Grp, Galicia, Spain.",damian.insua@usc.es; gonzalo.miguez@usc.es,"Miguez-Macho, Gonzalo/AAA-3295-2019; Miguez-Macho, Gonzalo/K-7008-2017","Miguez-Macho, Gonzalo/0000-0002-4259-7883; Miguez-Macho, Gonzalo/0000-0002-4259-7883","European Commission (EartH2Observe)European Commission; Spanish Ministerio de Economia y CompetitividadSpanish Government [CGL2017-89859-R, CGL2013-45932-R]; CRETUS Strategic Partnership [AGRUP2015/02]","Funding for this work came from the European Commission FP7 (EartH2Observe) and the Spanish Ministerio de Economia y Competitividad (CGL2017-89859-R and CGL2013-45932-R), and from contributions by the CRETUS Strategic Partnership (AGRUP2015/02).

We propose a parsimonious data-driven model, EDM-Simplex, with two objectives: forecasting recession and characterizing its nonlinear behavior. We evaluate the new model through a global sensitivity analysis applied to three distinctive hydrograph series from a heterogeneous karstic catchment. The results show excellent 1-day-ahead forecasting performance (median Nash and Sutcliffe efficiency > 0.99) for all time series with four recession extraction methods. The sensitivity analysis also showed that empirical nonlinearity, that is, sensitivity to initial conditions, is best estimated through the absolute forecast performance and its decline over time. This indicator leads to different interpretations of nonlinearity compared to previous methods but is just as sensitive to the choice of recession extraction method. In particular, when forecasts were made for recession segments containing early stages of recession or flow anomalies, the upstream recession was significantly more linear than the downstream recession hydrographs affected by the karst. Consequently, our results support future research to interpret observed nonlinearities as a function of the catchment hydrological states for better integration of empirical, physical-based, and operational approaches to recession analysis.","[Delforge, Damien; Vanclooster, Marnik] Catholic Univ Louvain, Earth & Life Inst, Louvain La Neuve, Belgium; [Delforge, Damien; Van Camp, Michel] Royal Observ Belgium, Brussels, Belgium; [Munoz-Carpena, Rafael] Univ Florida, Dept Agr & Biol Engn, Gainesville, FL USA",,"Delforge, D (corresponding author), Catholic Univ Louvain, Earth & Life Inst, Louvain La Neuve, Belgium.; Delforge, D (corresponding author), Royal Observ Belgium, Brussels, Belgium.",damien.delforge@uclouvain.be,"Van+Camp, Michel/ABE-5941-2020; Van Camp, M/L-7281-2015; Munoz-Carpena, Rafael/A-7588-2010","Van Camp, M/0000-0002-2859-3122; Vanclooster, Marnik/0000-0003-1358-8723; Munoz-Carpena, Rafael/0000-0003-2838-1514; Delforge, Damien/0000-0002-3552-9444",Fonds de la Recherche Scientifique-FNRS (Belgium)Fonds de la Recherche Scientifique - FNRS,"Damien Delforge is FRIA grantee of the Fonds de la Recherche Scientifique-FNRS (Belgium).

China has experienced an astonishing expansion of its urban scale in the past 40 years, and nearly 783 million of the nation's people now live in cities. Beijing-Tianjin-Hebei, the Yangtze River Delta and the Pearl River Delta have been prioritized to become world-class clusters by 2020. The health effects of air pollution in these three urban agglomerations are becoming increasingly formidable. Given these conditions, using the daily mean PM(2.5)concentration in 40 cities from January 2014 to December 2016, this research explored the spatial-temporal characteristics of PM(2.5)concentrations in these three urban agglomerations. The annual mean PM(2.5)concentrations in Beijing-Tianjin-Hebei, the Yangtze River Delta and the Pearl River Delta are 35.39 mu g/m(3), 53.72 mu g/m(3)and 78.54 mu g/m(3), respectively. Compared with the other two urban agglomerations, abundant rainfall causes the Pearl River Delta to have the lowest PM(2.5)level. Furthermore, a general regression neural network (GRNN) method is developed to predict the PM(2.5)concentration in these clusters on the second day, with inputs including the average, maximum and minimum temperature; average, maximum and minimum atmosphere; total rainfall; average humidity; average and maximum wind speed; and the PM(2.5)concentration measured 1 day ahead. The results indicate that the GRNN method can precisely predict the concentration level in these clusters, and it is especially useful for the Pearl River Delta, as the underlying influence mechanism is more specified in this cluster than in the others. Importantly, this 1-day-ahead forecasting of PM(2.5)concentrations can raise awareness among the public to improve their precautionary behaviours and help urban planners to provide corresponding support.

A high frequency tropical typhoon area located on Northwest of Vietnam was selected as a case study. For this purpose, a GIS database for the study areas was prepared, including 654 flash-flood inundations and 12 influencing variables (elevation, slope, curvature, toposhade, aspect, topographic wetness index, stream power index, stream density, Normalized Difference Vegetation Index, soil type, lithology, and rainfall), which were compiled from various sources. The database was used to build and verify the prediction model. We assessed the model's performance through various indices including Classification Accuracy Rate, Area under the Curve (AUC), Precision, and Recall. We also compared the model's usability with five state-of-the-art machine learning techniques including the Backpropagation Neural Network, Support Vector Machine, and Classification Tree. The results revealed that the hybrid PSO-MARS model outperformed other benchmark models in all the employed statistical measures.

Model-free and model-based quantification of diurnal temperature range (DTR) time series predictability is provided in this paper. Both intrinsic predictability quantified by the permutation entropy and realizable predictability defined by the model's forecasting error are studied on DTR fluctuations. The intrinsic predictability tells us whether there are more predictive structures in DTR fluctuations and to what extent the maximal predictability can be reached. The realizable predictability measures the degree of prediction to which adopted model reaches. Results show that there is a well defined regime-dependent pattern between the intrinsic predictability and the realizable predictability in DTR fluctuations, and both the intrinsic predictability and the realizable predictability in DTR fluctuations over China are overall South-North (with the dividing line around the latitude of 37 degrees N and almost along the Yellow River, and south and north to this line are called southern China and northern China in this study) asymmetric with higher predictability in southern China and weaker predictability in northern China.

The real-time precipitation at point and catchment scales evaluated to select proper hydrological model to couple with atmospheric model. As a major limitation of previous studies, temporal and spatial resolutions of hydrological model are smaller than those of meteorological model. Here, through high resolution of temporal (10 min) and spatial (1 km x 1 km), the optimal resolution determined. The results showed Weather Research and Forecasting (WRF) model underestimated precipitation in point and catchment assessment and its skill was relatively higher for catchment than point scale, as illustrated by the lower Root Mean Square Error (RMSE) of 59.67, 160.48, 68.49 for the catchment and 84.49, 212.80 and 91.53 for the point scale in the events 2002, 2007 and 2011, respectively. The findings led to choose the semi-distributed hydrological model. The variations in temporal and spatial resolutions illustrated accuracy decrease; additionally, the optimal spatial resolution obtained at 8 km and temporal resolution did not affect the inherent inaccuracy of the results. Lead-time variation demonstrated that lead-time dependency was almost negligible below 36 h.

This paper developed a visual and virtual project control system that proactively promotes team-based planning and real-time communication of progress and schedule risk. The system benefits from the growth of visual data on construction sites and the increasing maturity level of building information modeling (BIM), to map the current state of production in 3D and expose waste. By modeling production trends, reliability in the future state of production is forecasted to highlight potential delay issues in a location-driven scheme. A visual 3D interface supports collaborative decision-making to eliminate root causes of waste, enables pull flows between people and information, decentralizes work tracking, and facilitates in-process quality control and hand-overs among contractors. This system was implemented on two projects to validate the underlying algorithms. Results show that the system's functional aspects improve transparency, accountability, and traceability in project execution, and streamline communications between the field and the office. Specifically, 30% PPC increase and four weeks project completion date advance have been observed.

A total of six intense precipitation events over the Ganges-Brahmaputra-Meghna and Indus River basins were tested to identify the most suitable combination of parameterization and initialization techniques. The global forecast system (GFS)-based numerical weather prediction (NWP) forecast fields were dynamically downscaled by the mesoscale model of weather research and forecasting (WRF). The performance of four types of initial conditions with three cloud microphysics was assessed using a model resolution of up to 9 km. A main conclusion is that the model initialized using hot start in the study involves more uncertainty, probably due to poor-quality data assimilation, and it cannot exceed the performance of cold-start initialization. The study findings provide evidence that the finer resolution initial condition is promising in higher resolution models. In the case of cloud microphysics, the performance of WRF single moment 5 class (WSM5) was sufficient for South Asian monsoon systems within this scale of the model resolution. The findings provide a general guideline for flood forecasters for the WRF model set-up for forecasting the ISMR from publicly available GFS-based NWP forecast fields.","[Sikder, Md Safat; Hossain, Faisal] Univ Washington, Dept Civil & Environm Engn, Seattle, WA 98195 USA",,"Hossain, F (corresponding author), Univ Washington, Dept Civil & Environm Engn, Seattle, WA 98195 USA.",fhossain@uw.edu,"Sikder, Md Safat/S-6024-2019","Sikder, Md Safat/0000-0002-1910-1800",National Aeronautics and Space AdministrationNational Aeronautics & Space Administration (NASA) [NNX16AO68H]; NASA Earth and Space Fellowship [NNX16AO68H]; NASANational Aeronautics & Space Administration (NASA) [NNX15AC63G],"National Aeronautics and Space Administration, Grant/Award Number: NNX16AO68H; NASA Earth and Space Fellowship, Grant/Award Number: NNX16AO68H; NASA, Grant/Award Number: NNX15AC63G",,61,3,3,1,14,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",1350-4827,1469-8080,,METEOROL APPL,Meteorol.

Besides, these existing production decline evaluation techniques for unconventional reserves estimations have underlying limitations and assumptions incorporated into their formulation which can result into under- and overestimation. This further raises the debate about which decline curve analysis (DCA) is better than the other for unconventional reservoirs predictions. Currently, data-driven artificial neural network (ANN) has emerged as a new paradigm capable of mapping complex functional relationships. In this present study, ANN technology was used to calibrate tight gas carbonate field historical declining trends which exhibit high early peak production rate and quick decline. Hereafter, making reliable predictions posed as a challenge for the complex target field and hard computing protocols. Therefore, this research applied and tested the capability of backpropagation artificial neural network (BPANN), radial basis function neural network (RBNN) and generalized regression neural network (GRNN) as DCA techniques for predicting the historical production decline trends of an ultra-low porosity and permeability tight gas reservoir. The optimum trained ANN DCA models developed were validated with another surrounding well's dataset, producing acceptable results in agreement with the actual field data. The GRNN DCA model's testing performance was poor, and its smoothing parameter was optimized with particle swarm optimization (PSO) algorithm which gave satisfactory results comparable to standalone BPANN and RBFNN DCA models. Furthermore, the optimum ANN DCA models' generalization strength across the entire field dataset revealed that the developed models' predictions were robust as compared to the data-driven Arps hyperbolic and power law exponential DCA models. This was evident from the statistical performance criteria employed which indicated that BPANN, RBFNN and PSO-GRNN DCA models are plausible better fit models for matching the target field's historical decline performances. Also, a novel non-Darcy flow horizontal well productivity evaluation model for the target field was developed based on stress sensitivity coefficient (SSC) of permeability, tortuosity factor, Klinkenberg effect, near-wellbore turbulence effect and threshold pressure gradient (TPG) for validating the ANN DCA models predictions. The productivity model was validated with published horizontal well model with closely matched results. For inflow performances, the horizontal well model with turbulence minimizes negative effects on non-Darcy flow rates than without turbulence. Additionally, pressure drawdown influences the tight gas well productivity such that the lower the pressure drawdown, the smaller the tight gas well productivity. The operating points of the tight gas well were determined through inflow performance relation and tubing performance relation at different SSC and TPG for 3in tubing size. In another case, synthetic unconventional simulation data with long production history were used for future forecast of 5, 24 and 70months of production rate and cumulative production which gave pretty close results for all the DCA models, unlike the real field datasets, where the empirical rate-time models under and overestimate. In all, these ANN DCA models and the horizontal well productivity model derived will serve as new computational tools for complementing existing DCA techniques for better understanding of unconventional reservoirs' production decline performance.","[Brantson, Eric Thompson; Ju, Binshan] China Univ Geosci Beijing, Sch Energy Resources, Beijing 100083, Peoples R China; [Brantson, Eric Thompson; Ju, Binshan] China Univ Geosci Beijing, Key Lab Marine Reservoir Evolut & Hydrocarbon Acc, Minist Educ, Beijing, Peoples R China; [Ziggah, Yao Yevenyo] Univ Mines & Technol, Fac Mineral Resource Technol, Dept Geomat Engn, Tarkwa, Western Region, Ghana; [Akwensi, Perpetual Hope] China Univ Geosci Beijing, Sch Land Sci & Technol, Beijing 100083, Peoples R China; [Sun, Yan] Shandong Univ Finance & Econ, Sch Management Sci & Engn, Jinan 250014, Shandong, Peoples R China; [Wu, Dan] SIPO, Patent Examinat Cooperat Ctr, Beijing 100081, Peoples R China; [Addo, Bright Junior] Univ Ghana, Dept Econ & Geog & Resource Dev, Legon, Ghana",,"Brantson, ET; Ju, BS (corresponding author), China Univ Geosci Beijing, Sch Energy Resources, Beijing 100083, Peoples R China.; Brantson, ET; Ju, BS (corresponding author), China Univ Geosci Beijing, Key Lab Marine Reservoir Evolut & Hydrocarbon Acc, Minist Educ, Beijing, Peoples R China.",jubs2936@163.com,"Ziggah, Yao Yevenyo/C-4070-2016","Ziggah, Yao Yevenyo/0000-0002-9940-1845",Fundamental Research Funds for National Science and Technology Major Projects [2016ZX05011-002]; Fundamental Research Funds for the Central UniversitiesFundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities [2652015142],"The work was supported by the Fundamental Research Funds for National Science and Technology Major Projects (2016ZX05011-002) and the Central Universities (2652015142).

In this study, the sensitivity of dynamical downscaling seasonal precipitation forecasts to convection and land surface parameterization was investigated by nesting the Weather Research and Forecasting (WRF) model into the NCEP's Climate Forecast System version 2 (CFSv2) retrospective forecasts with four convective schemes: Kain-Fritsch (KF), Betts-Miller-Janjic (BMJ), Grell-Freitas (GF), and new simplified Arakawa-Schubert (NSAS) schemes, and two land surface schemes: Noah and simplified Simple Biosphere (SSiB) schemes over the Han River basin. The CFSv2 model biases are reduced when the KF convective scheme is used in the wet summer season. However, negative biases still exist especially when the combination of BMJ and SSiB schemes is used. Compared with CFSv2 reforecasts and other combinations of schemes, the forecast skills of spatial patterns of precipitation anomalies are highest when the combination of KF and Noah schemes is used in summer. In contrast, the combination of BMJ and SSiB schemes shows lowest forecast skills in summer. To understand the causes of the differences in precipitation forecasts using different parameterization schemes, the simulated moisture flux convergence, thermodynamic parameters at different pressure levels, convective available potential energy (CAPE), convective inhibition (CIN), and heat fluxes are compared with the data in the ERA-5 reanalysis dataset. The WRF model-simulated moisture flux convergence is closer to that of the ERA-5 reanalysis compared with that of the CFSv2 reforecasts in summer. The vertical thermodynamic profiles also suggest that the combination of the KF and Noah schemes has caused a more unstable atmosphere, which is crucial for precipitation. In contrast, the combination of BMJ and SSiB schemes shows a less unstable atmospheric environment in summer, which explains the lower forecast skills compared with other schemes. The spatial patterns of CAPE are also improved when using the WRF model, which further enhances the precipitation forecast skills over the Han River basin.","[Li, Yuan; Lu, Guihua; He, Hai; Wu, Zhiyong] Hohai Univ, Coll Hydrol & Water Resources, Nanjing 210098, Jiangsu, Peoples R China",,"He, H (corresponding author), Hohai Univ, Coll Hydrol & Water Resources, Nanjing 210098, Jiangsu, Peoples R China.",hehai_hhu@hhu.edu.cn,,,"National Key R&D Program of China [2018YFC0407701, 2017YFC1502403]; National Natural Science Foundation of ChinaNational Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC) [51579065, 51779071]; Fundamental Research Funds for the Central UniversitiesFundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities [2017B10514, 2017B681X14]; Postgraduate Research & Practice Innovation Program of Jiangsu Province [KYCX17_0413]","This work was funded by the National Key R&D Program of China (Grant no. 2018YFC0407701 and 2017YFC1502403), the National Natural Science Foundation of China (Grant no. 51579065 and 51779071), the Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities (Grant no. 2017B10514 and 2017B681X14), and the Postgraduate Research & Practice Innovation Program of Jiangsu Province (Grant no.

Two post-processing methods, the ensemble model output statistics based on censored shifted gamma distribution (CSGD-EMOS) and quantile mapping (QM), were used to reduce bias and to improve the QPFs. The results were evaluated by using three incremental precipitation thresholds and multiple verification metrics. It is demonstrated that QPFs from NCEP and ECMWF presented similarly skillful forecasts, although the ECMWF QPFs performed more satisfactorily in the typhoon season and the NCEP QPFs were better in the plum rain season. Most of the verification metrics showed evident seasonal discriminations, with more satisfactory behavior in the plum rain season. Lighter precipitation tended to be overestimated, but heavier precipitation was always underestimated. The post-processed QPFs showed a significant improvement from the raw forecasts and the effects of post-processing varied with the lead time, precipitation threshold, and EPS. Precipitation was better corrected at longer lead times and higher thresholds. CSGD-EMOS was more effective for probabilistic metrics and the root-mean-square error. QM had a greater effect on removing bias according to bias and categorical metrics, but was unable to warrant reliabilities. In general, raw forecasts can provide acceptable QPFs eight days in advance. After post-processing, the useful forecasts can be significantly extended beyond 10 days, showing promising prospects for flood forecasting.","[Liu, Li; Gao, Chao; Xu, Yue-Ping] Zhejiang Univ, Inst Hydrol & Water Resources, Coll Civil Engn & Architecture, Hangzhou 310058, Zhejiang, Peoples R China; [Zhu, Qian] Southeast Univ, Sch Civil Engn, Nanjing 210096, Jiangsu, Peoples R China",,"Xu, YP (corresponding author), Zhejiang Univ, Inst Hydrol & Water Resources, Coll Civil Engn & Architecture, Hangzhou 310058, Zhejiang, Peoples R China.",yuepingxu@zju.edu.cn,"Xu, Yueping/C-2934-2014",,National Key Research and Development Program [2016YFE0122100]; National Natural Science Foundation of ChinaNational Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC) [91547106],Supported by the National Key Research and Development Program (2016YFE0122100) and National Natural Science Foundation of China (91547106).,,74,4,4,0,6,SPRINGER HEIDELBERG,HEIDELBERG,"TIERGARTENSTRASSE 17, D-69121 HEIDELBERG, GERMANY",2095-6037,2198-0934,,J METEOROL RES-PRC,J.

The advent of increasingly sophisticated supervised learning methods to capture and generalize complex patterns from data has unchained a flurry of research analyzing the performance of different models when learning from real data collected in road networks of very diverse nature. Nonetheless, the community has paid little attention to the use of reservoir computing models for traffic prediction. This field comprises several different modeling approaches ranging from liquid state machines to echo state networks, all sharing in common recurrence and randomness between neural processing units. This paper builds upon this research niche by exploring how ensembles of Echo State Networks can yield improved traffic forecasts when compared to other machine learning models. Specifically, we propose a regression model composed by a stacking ensemble of reservoir computing learners. As evinced by simulation results obtained with real data from Madrid (Spain), the synergistic combination of stacking ensembles and reservoir computing allows our proposed model to outperform other machine learning models considered in our benchmark.","[Del Ser, Javier; Lana, Ibai] TECNALIA, Derio 48160, Bizkaia, Spain; [Del Ser, Javier; Bilbao, Miren Nekane] Univ Basque Country UPV EHU, Bilbao 48013, Bizkaia, Spain; [Vlahogianni, Eleni I.] NTUA, Athens, Greece",,"Del Ser, J (corresponding author), TECNALIA, Derio 48160, Bizkaia, Spain.; Del Ser, J (corresponding author), Univ Basque Country UPV EHU, Bilbao 48013, Bizkaia, Spain.",javier.delser@tecnalia.com,"Del Ser, Javier/AAA-2965-2021","Del Ser, Javier/0000-0002-1260-9775; Lana, Ibai/0000-0002-2682-6199",Basque Government through the EMAITEK programBasque Government,The authors would like to thank the Basque Government for its support through the EMAITEK program.,,40,1,1,0,0,IEEE,NEW YORK,"345 E 47TH ST, NEW YORK, NY 10017 USA",2153-0009,,978-1-5386-7024-8,IEEE INT C INTELL TR,,,2019,,,,,,,2591,2597,,,,,7,Transportation Science & Technology,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S),Transportation,BO6LS,WOS:000521238102104,,,,,2022-02-17

The performance of these models relies on the selection of appropriate inputs. However, Input Variable Selection (IVS) is typically performed using expert knowledge or simple linear methods. This research compares and evaluates four IVS methods including two model-free methods: partial correlation (PC), partial mutual information (PMI), and two novel model-based methods: an improved input omission (IO), and improved combined neural pathway strength (CNPS). A comprehensive comparison of performance efficacy for multiple IVS methods has not been published in literature before. Each method is used for daily and hourly lead times in the Bow and Don Rivers (both in Canada), respectively. These watersheds represent different hydrological systems and were selected to highlight the performance of the IVS methods under differing conditions. This research determines that the proposed CNPS produces the strongest performing ANNs based on the robustness of the inputs selected, comparison to other IVS methods, and models developed without IVS. Additionally, this research demonstrates that standard termination criteria do not reliably identify the optimum number of inputs for the ANNs and using a model-based optimization of inputs is recommended. As a result, it is recommended that the number of inputs be determined using a systematic approach, where each input selection is informed by an IVS-based input ranking, rather than a predefined termination criterion. Lastly, this research demonstrates that input usefulness is not binary concept; the correct number of selected inputs is dependant on the desired model complexity, instead of an arbitrarily selected IVS termination criteria.","[Snieder, E.; Shakir, R.; Khan, U.

The long short-term memory works on the sequential framework which considers all of the predecessor data. This forecasting method used daily discharged data collected from the Basantapur gauging station located on the Mahanadi River basin, India. Different metrics [root-mean-square error (RMSE), Nash-Sutcliffe efficiency (E-NS), correlation coefficient (R) and mean absolute error] were selected to assess the performance of the model. Additionally, recurrent neural network (RNN) model is also used to compare the adaptability of LSTM-RNN over RNN and naive method. The results conclude that the LSTM-RNN model (R = 0.943, E-NS = 0.878, RMSE = 0.487) outperformed RNN model (R = 0.935, E-NS = 0.843, RMSE = 0.516) and naive method (R = 0.866, E-NS = 0.704, RMSE = 0.793).

Hybrid data-driven prediction models using Ensemble Empirical Mode Composition (EEMD) coupled with Machine Learning (ML) algorithms are useful for achieving these purposes because they can reduce the difficulty of modeling, require less history data, are easy to develop, and are less complex than physical models. In this article, a computationally simple, less data-intensive, fast and efficient novel hybrid data-driven model called the EEMD Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) neural network, namely EEMD-LSTM, is proposed to reduce the difficulty of modeling and to improve prediction accuracy. The daily LST data series from the Mapoling and Zhijiang stations in the Dongting Lake basin, central south China, from 1 January 2014 to 31 December 2016 is used as a case study. The EEMD is firstly employed to decompose the original daily LST data series into many Intrinsic Mode Functions (IMFs) and a single residue item. Then, the Partial Autocorrelation Function (PACF) is used to obtain the number of input data sample points for LSTM models. Next, the LSTM models are constructed to predict the decompositions. All the predicted results of the decompositions are aggregated as the final daily LST. Finally, the prediction performance of the hybrid EEMD-LSTM model is assessed in terms of the Mean Square Error (MSE), Mean Absolute Error (MAE), Mean Absolute Percentage Error (MAPE), Root Mean Square Error (RMSE), Pearson Correlation Coefficient (CC) and Nash-Sutcliffe Coefficient of Efficiency (NSCE). To validate the hybrid data-driven model, the hybrid EEMD-LSTM model is compared with the Recurrent Neural Network (RNN), LSTM and Empirical Mode Decomposition (EMD) coupled with RNN, EMD-LSTM and EEMD-RNN models, and their comparison results demonstrate that the hybrid EEMD-LSTM model performs better than the other five models. The scatterplots of the predicted results of the six models versus the original daily LST data series show that the hybrid EEMD-LSTM model is superior to the other five models. It is concluded that the proposed hybrid EEMD-LSTM model in this study is a suitable tool for temperature forecasting.","[Zhang, Xike; Zhang, Qiuwen] Huazhong Univ Sci & Technol, Sch Hydropower & Informat Engn, Wuhan 430074, Hubei, Peoples R China; [Zhang, Xike; Nie, Zhiping] Hunan City Univ, Sch Municipal & Mapping Engn, Yiyang 413000, Peoples R China; [Zhang, Gui; Que, Huafei] Cent South Univ Forestry & Technol, Key Lab Digital Dongting Lake Basin Hunan Prov, Changsha 410004, Hunan, Peoples R China; [Gui, Zifan] Shenzhen Garden Management Ctr, Shenzhen 518000, Peoples R China",,"Zhang, QW (corresponding author), Huazhong Univ Sci & Technol, Sch Hydropower & Informat Engn, Wuhan 430074, Hubei, Peoples R China.; Zhang, G (corresponding author), Cent South Univ Forestry & Technol, Key Lab Digital Dongting Lake Basin Hunan Prov, Changsha 410004, Hunan, Peoples R China.",koko@hust.edu.cn; qwzhang@hust.edu.cn; csuft3s@hotmail.com; zhipingnie@hotmail.com; guizifan@126.com; quehuafei@hotmail.com,"Zhang, Xike/E-7574-2019",,"National Natural Science Foundation of ChinaNational Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC) [41672263, 41072199]; Key Program of the Natural Science Foundation of Hubei Province in China [2015CFA134]; Key Program of the Science & Technology Plan of Hunan Province in China [2016SK2088]","This research was funded by the National Natural Science Foundation of China (Nos. 41672263, 41072199), the Key Program of the Natural Science Foundation of Hubei Province in China (No. 2015CFA134) and the Key Program of the Science & Technology Plan of Hunan Province in China (No. 2016SK2088).",,56,38,38,7,48,MDPI,BASEL,"ST ALBAN-ANLAGE 66, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND",,1660-4601,,INT J ENV RES PUB HE,Int.

The operational predictions of West Central Indian summer rainfall (WCI-R) and Peninsular Indian summer rainfall (PI-R) made by the Indian Meteorological Department (IMD) had no skills during 2004-2012. This motivates the present study aiming at better understanding the predictability sources and physical processes governing summer rainfall variability over these two regions. Analysis of 133 year data reveal that although the lower boundary forcing that associated with enhanced WCI-R and PI-R featured a similar developing La-Nina and east high west low sea-level pressure (SLP) dipole pattern across the Indo-Pacific, the anomalous high sea surface temperature (SST) over the northern Indian Ocean and weak low pressure over northern Asia tended to enhance PI-R but reduce WCI-R. Based on our understanding of physical linkages with the predictands, we selected four and two causative predictors for predictions of the WCI-R and PI-R, respectively. The intensified summer WCI-R is preceded by (a) Indian Ocean zonal dipole-like SST tendency (west-warming and east-cooling), (b) tropical Pacific zonal dipole SST tendency (west-warming and east-cooling), (c) central Pacific meridional dipole SST tendency (north-cooling and south-warming), and (d) decreasing SLP tendency over northern Asia in the previous season. The enhanced PI-R was lead by the central-eastern Pacific cooling and 2-m temperature cooling tendency east of Lake Balkhash in the previous seasons. These causative processes linking the predictors and WCI-R and PI-R are supported by ensemble numerical experiments using a coupled climate model. For the period of 1871-2012, the physics-based empirical (P-E) prediction models built on these predictors result in cross-validated forecast temporal correlation coefficient skills of 0.55 and 0.47 for WCI-R and PI-R, respectively. The independent forecast skill is significantly higher than the skill of operational seasonal forecast made by the IMD for the period of 2004-2012. These prediction models offer a tool for seasonal prediction and their retrospective forecast skills provide an estimation of the lower bound of the predictability for WCI-R and PI-R.","[Li, Juan; Wang, Bin; Yang, Young-Min] Nanjing Univ Informat Sci & Technol, Earth Syst Modeling Ctr, Nanjing, Jiangsu, Peoples R China; [Li, Juan; Wang, Bin; Yang, Young-Min] Univ Hawaii Manoa, Dept Atmospher Sci, Honolulu, HI 96822 USA; [Li, Juan; Wang, Bin; Yang, Young-Min] Univ Hawaii Manoa, Int Pacific Res Ctr, Honolulu, HI 96822 USA",,"Wang, B (corresponding author), Nanjing Univ Informat Sci & Technol, Earth Syst Modeling Ctr, Nanjing, Jiangsu, Peoples R China.; Wang, B (corresponding author), Univ Hawaii Manoa, Dept Atmospher Sci, Honolulu, HI 96822 USA.; Wang, B (corresponding author), Univ Hawaii Manoa, Int Pacific Res Ctr, Honolulu, HI 96822 USA.",wangbin@hawaii.edu,,,"Atmosphere-Ocean Research Center (AORC); IPRC at University of Hawaii; National Research Foundation (NRF) of Korea through a Global Research Laboratory (GRL) grant of the Korean Ministry of Education, Science and Technology (MEST) [2011-0021927]; Nanjing University of Information Science and Technology (NUIST)Nanjing University of Information Science & Technology","This study is supported by the Atmosphere-Ocean Research Center (AORC) and IPRC at University of Hawaii and the National Research Foundation (NRF) of Korea through a Global Research Laboratory (GRL) grant of the Korean Ministry of Education, Science and Technology (MEST, #2011-0021927).

The main aim of the research is to develop models and algorithms for adaptive identification and interpretation of testing horizontal wells with forecasting the late-time radial flow regime of pressure build-up curves. The methods. The authors have used the theoretical and practical developments in the field of adaptive interpretation of well testing, optimization methods, linear algebra, current research of system analysis, identification and adaptation of system. To solve the problems of identification and forecasting, the authors used evolutionary phenomenological models of pressure build-up curves with variable time-dependent parameters taking into account additional prior information on reservoir pressure. The pressure build-up curves were in ' terpreted on the basis of the adaptive identification method. The problems were solved using the field data of testing horizontal wells of oil fields on the pressure build-up curves. The results. The authors investigated potentialities of evolutionary phenomenological models with variable parameters for identifying and forecasting the pressure build-up curve in the absence of the late ' time radial flow regime. The results of interpretation of testing horizontal well show that the developed models and algorithms of adaptive identification and interpretation allow: reliable enough prediction of bottomhole pressure that has not recovered on the pressure build-up curve; determination of lateral permeability, skin factor, effective well length and the well shut-in time during the well testing, significant reduction of the well shut-in time.","[Sergeev, Viktor L.; Dong Van Hoang; Pham Dinh An] Natl Res Tomsk Polytech Univ, 30 Lenin Ave, Tomsk 634050, Russia",,"Sergeev, VL (corresponding author), Natl Res Tomsk Polytech Univ, 30 Lenin Ave, Tomsk 634050, Russia.",SergeevVL@ignd.tpu.ru; hoang.tpu@gmail.com; phaman.tpu@gmail.com,,,,,,20,2,2,0,0,"TOMSK POLYTECHNIC UNIV, PUBLISHING HOUSE",TOMSK,"30, LENIN AVE, TOMSK, 634050, RUSSIA",2500-1019,2413-1830,,BULL TOMSK POLYTECH,Bull.

In this study, the interannual rainfall model (IAM) and the decadal rainfall model (DM) were constructed. Moving updating of the IAM with the latest data within an optimal length of training period (20 yr) can partially offset the effect of decadal change of precursors in IAM. To predict the interannual rainfall of 2001-13 for validation, 13 regression models were fitted with precursors that change every 4-5 yr, from the preceding winter North Atlantic Ocean sea surface temperature anomaly (SSTA) dipole to the Mascarene high, followed by the East Asia sea level pressure anomaly (SLPA) dipole and the preceding autumn North Pacific SSTA dipole. The moving updated model demonstrated high skill in predicting interannual rainfall, with a correlation coefficient of 0.76 and a hit rate of 76.9%. The DM was linked to the April SLPA in the central tropical Pacific Ocean, and it maintained good performance in the testing period, with a correlation coefficient of 0.77 and a root-mean-square error (RMSE) of 7.7%. The statistical model exhibited superior capability even when compared with the best forecast by the Climate Forecast System, version 2 (CFSv2), initiated in early June, as indicated by increased correlation coefficient from 0.62 to 0.75 and reduced RMSE from 12.3% to 10.7%.","[Guo, Yan; Li, Jianping] Beijing Normal Univ, State Key Lab Earth Surface Proc & Resource Ecol, Beijing, Peoples R China; [Guo, Yan] Beijing Normal Univ, Zhuhai Joint Innovat Ctr Climate Environm Ecosyst, Future Earth Res Inst, Zhuhai, Peoples R China; [Guo, Yan] Beijing Normal Univ, Coll Global Change & Earth Syst Sci, Zhuhai, Peoples R China; [Li, Jianping] Joint Ctr Global Change Studies, Beijing, Peoples R China; [Zhu, Jiangshan] Chinese Acad Sci, Inst Atmospher Phys, Beijing, Peoples R China; [Li, Jianping] Qingdao Natl Lab Marine Sci & Technol, Lab Reg Oceanog & Numer Modeling, Qingdao, Peoples R China",,"Li, JP (corresponding author), Beijing Normal Univ, State Key Lab Earth Surface Proc & Resource Ecol, Beijing, Peoples R China.; Li, JP (corresponding author), Joint Ctr Global Change Studies, Beijing, Peoples R China.; Li, JP (corresponding author), Qingdao Natl Lab Marine Sci & Technol, Lab Reg Oceanog & Numer Modeling, Qingdao, Peoples R China.",ljp@bnu.edu.cn,"Li, Jianping/I-2661-2012","Li, Jianping/0000-0003-0625-1575","NSFC ProjectNational Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC) [41305053, 41530424]; National Programme on Global Change and Air-Sea Interaction [GASI-IPOVAI-03]",This study is jointly supported by the NSFC Project (41305053 and 41530424) and the National Programme on Global Change and Air-Sea Interaction (GASI-IPOVAI-03).,,33,3,4,1,11,AMER METEOROLOGICAL SOC,BOSTON,"45 BEACON ST, BOSTON, MA 02108-3693 USA",1558-8424,1558-8432,,J APPL METEOROL CLIM,J.

It is found that the GloSea5 has a great prediction skill of El Nino whose anomaly correlation coefficients of Nino indices are over 0.96 during winter. The eastern Pacific (EP) El Nino and the central Pacific (CP) El Nino are considered and we analyze for EP El Nino, which is well simulated in GloSea5. The analysis period is divided into the developing phase of El Nino summer (JJA(0)), mature phase of El Nino winter (D(0)JF(1)), and decaying phase of El Nino summer (JJA(1)). The GloSea5 simulates the relationship between precipitation and temperature in East Asia and the prediction skill for the East Asian precipitation and temperature varies depending on the El Nino phase. While the precipitation and temperature are simulated well over the equatorial western Pacific region, there are biases in mid-latitude region during the JJA(0) and JJA(1). Because the low level pressure, wind, and vertical stream function are simulated weakly toward mid-latitude region, though they are similar with observation in low-latitude region. During the D(0)JF(1), the precipitation and temperature patterns analogize with observation in most regions, but there is temperature bias in inland over East Asia. The reason is that the GloSea5 poorly predicts the weakening of Siberian high, even though the shift of Aleutian low is predicted. Overall, the predictability of precipitation and temperature related to El Nino in the GloSea5 is considered to be better in D(0)JF(1) than JJA(0) and JJA(1) and better in ocean than in inland region.","[Lim, So-Min; Hyun, Yu-Kyung; Kang, Hyun-Suk] Natl Inst Meteorol Sci, Earth Syst Res Div, 33 Seohobuk Ro, Seogwipo Si 63568, Jeju, South Korea; [Yeh, Sang-Wook] Hanyang Univ, Dept Marine Sci & Convergent Technol, Ansan, South Korea",,"Lim, SM (corresponding author), Natl Inst Meteorol Sci, Earth Syst Res Div, 33 Seohobuk Ro, Seogwipo Si 63568, Jeju, South Korea.",smlim48@gmail.com,"Hyun, Yu-Kyung/ABI-7900-2020; Yeh, Sang-Wook/G-3007-2014","Yeh, Sang-Wook/0000-0003-4549-1686",,,,43,7,7,0,4,KOREAN METEOROLOGICAL SOC,SEOUL,"SHINKIL-DONG 508, SIWON BLDG 704, YONGDUNGPO-GU, SEOUL, 150-050, SOUTH KOREA",1598-3560,2288-3266,,ATMOS-KOREA,Atmos.-Korea,MAR,2018,28,1,,,,,37,51,,10.14191/Atmos.2018.28.1.037,,,15,Meteorology & Atmospheric Sciences,Emerging Sources Citation Index (ESCI),Meteorology & Atmospheric Sciences,GF3MS,WOS:000431860800004,,,,,2022-02-17

The objective of this paper is a first assessment of the skill of hydrological forecasts based on Numerical Weather Predictions (NWPs) in comparison to the skill of forecasts based on climatology for monthly forecasts with daily resolutions and to identify possibilities of improvement by post-processing the hydrological forecasts. Various hydrological relevant model variables, such as the surface and subsurface runoff and the soil water content, will be analysed for entire Switzerland. The spatially aggregated predictions of these variables are compared to daily simulations and to long-term daily averages of simulations driven by meteorological observations (i.e. climatology). Besides this comparison of forecasts with simulations for model variables without direct measurements available, the skill of the monthly stream-flow forecasts is estimated at four catchments with discharge measurements. Additionally post-processing methods have been applied to remove bias and dispersion errors and to estimate the predictive uncertainty of the stream-flow. Some results of various verification measures like variants of the Geometric Mean for ratios of spatial aggregates and the Continuous Rank Probability Skill Score (CRPSS) will be shown. Apart from the indication of a strong diversity of upper limits of the forecast skill depending on catchment characteristics, the results of NWPs are generally superior to climatological predictions and could be applied gainfully for various kinds of long-term water management planning.","[Bogner, Konrad; Liechti, Katharina; Bernhard, Luzi; Monhart, Samuel; Zappa, Massimiliano] Swiss Fed Inst Forest Snow & Landscape Res WSL, Birmensdorf, Switzerland",,"Bogner, K (corresponding author), Swiss Fed Inst Forest Snow & Landscape Res WSL, Birmensdorf, Switzerland.",konrad.bogner@wsl.ch,"Zappa, Massimiliano/AAY-3821-2020; Zappa, Massimiliano/C-1205-2009; Bernhard, Luzi/AAM-6385-2021","Zappa, Massimiliano/0000-0002-2837-8190; Zappa, Massimiliano/0000-0002-2837-8190; , Konrad/0000-0002-4361-7751",Swiss National Research Programme on Sustainable Water Management [NRP 61]; Swiss Federal Office for Environment; WSL; MeteoSwiss; Commission for Technology and Innovation (CTI); NRP 70 - Energy Turnaround project [407040_153929],The application www.drought.ch is a product of the DROUGHT-CH project financed by Swiss National Research Programme on Sustainable Water Management (NRP 61).

The operational geostationary satellite imager carried by the Himawari-8 satellite, Advanced Himawari Imager (AHI), has two additional water vapor channels and four other channels compared with its predecessor, MTSAT-2. However, due to the uncertainty in surface parameters, AHI surface-sensitive channels are usually not assimilated over land, except for the three water vapor channels. Previous research showed that the brightness temperature of AHI channel 16 is much more sensitive to the lower-tropospheric temperature than to surface emissivity, which is similar to the three water vapor channels 8-10. As a follow-up work, this paper evaluates the effectiveness of assimilating brightness temperature observations over land from both the three AHI water vapor channels and channel 16 to improve watershed precipitation forecasting through both case analysis (in the Haihe River basin, China) and batch tests. It is found that assimilating AHI channel 16 can improve the upstream near-surface atmospheric temperature forecast, which in turn affects the development of downstream weather systems. The precipitation forecasting test results indicate that adding the terrestrial observations of channel 16 to the assimilation of AHI data can improve short-term precipitation forecasting in the basin.","[Ouyang, Hongxiang; Qin, Zhengkun] Nanjing Univ Informat Sci & Technol, Ctr Data Assimilat Res & Applicat, Nanjing 210044, Peoples R China; [Li, Juan] China Meteorol Adm, Natl Meteorol Ctr, Beijing 100081, Peoples R China; [Li, Juan] China Meteorol Adm, Numer Weather Predict Ctr, Beijing 100081, Peoples R China",,"Li, J (corresponding author), China Meteorol Adm, Natl Meteorol Ctr, Beijing 100081, Peoples R China.; Li, J (corresponding author), China Meteorol Adm, Numer Weather Predict Ctr, Beijing 100081, Peoples R China.",oyhx_cas@nuist.edu.cn; qzk_0@nuist.edu.cn; lj@cma.gov.cn,,,National Key R&D Program of China [2018YFC1507302]; Nanjing Joint Center of Atmospheric Research Program [NJCAR2018ZD01],FundingThis research was jointly funded by the National Key R&D Program of China (grant no. 2018YFC1507302) and the Nanjing Joint Center of Atmospheric Research Program (project NJCAR2018ZD01).,,55,0,0,4,4,MDPI,BASEL,"ST ALBAN-ANLAGE 66, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND",,2073-4433,,ATMOSPHERE-BASEL,Atmosphere,OCT,2021,12,10,,,,,,,1253,10.3390/atmos12101253,,,19,Environmental Sciences; Meteorology & Atmospheric Sciences,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),Environmental Sciences & Ecology; Meteorology & Atmospheric Sciences,WP5ZK,WOS:000713209200001,,gold,,,2022-02-17

The chaotic time series prediction has become a research hotspot in recent years. Because neural network can be strongly approximated nonlinearly, it has better prediction performance in the chaotic time series modeling. Extreme learning machine is a kind of neural network, and it is widely used due to its simple structure, high learning efficiency and having global optimal solution. Extreme learning machine initializes the input weight randomly and just adjusts the output weight in the training process, in order to be able to obtain the global optimal solution, so it has faster convergence speed and can overcome the disadvantage of gradient vanishing. Due to the above advantages, in recent years, the improved algorithms of the extreme learning machine have been developed rapidly. However, the traditional training methods of extreme learning machine have very poor robustness and can be affected easily by noise and outliers. And in practical applications, the time series are often contaminated by noise and outliers, so it is important to improve the forecasting model robustness and reduce the influence of noise and abnormal points to obtain better prediction accuracy. In this paper, a robust extreme learning machine is proposed in a Bayesian framework to solve the problem that outliers exist in the training data set. Firstly, the input samples are mapped onto the high-dimensional space, and the output weight of the extreme learning machine is used as the parameter to be estimated, then the proposed model utilizes the more robust Gaussian mixture distribution as the likelihood function of the model output. The marginal likelihood of the model output is analytically intractable for the Gaussian mixture distribution, so a variational procedure is introduced to realize the parameter estimation. In the cases of different noise levels and the different numbers of outliers, the proposed model is compared with the other prediction models. The experimental results of Lorenz, Rossler and Sunspot-Runoff in the Yellow River time series with outliers and noise demonstrate that the proposed robust extreme learning machine model could obtain a better prediction accuracy. The proposed robust extreme learning machine not only has the strong capability of the nonlinear approximation but also can learn the model parameters automatically and has strong robustness. At the same time, the time complexities of different models are compared and the convergence of the proposed model is analyzed at the end of the paper.","[Shen Li-Hua; Chen Ji-Hong; Jin Jian] Huazhong Univ Sci & Technol, Sch Mech Sci & Engn, Wuhan 430074, Hubei, Peoples R China; [Zeng Zhi-Gang] Huazhong Univ Sci & Technol, Sch Automat, Wuhan 430074, Hubei, Peoples R China",,"Jin, J (corresponding author), Huazhong Univ Sci & Technol, Sch Mech Sci & Engn, Wuhan 430074, Hubei, Peoples R China.",D201477195@hust.edu.cn,"Zeng, Zhigang/A-2816-2011","Zeng, Zhigang/0000-0003-4587-3588",National Natural Science Foundation of ChinaNational Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC) [51575210]; National Science and Technology Major Project of the Ministry of Science and Technology of China [2014ZX04001051],Project supported by the National Natural Science Foundation of China (Grant No. 51575210) and the National Science and Technology Major Project of the Ministry of Science and Technology of China (Grant No. 2014ZX04001051).,,26,3,6,6,38,CHINESE PHYSICAL SOC,BEIJING,"P O BOX 603, BEIJING 100080, PEOPLES R CHINA",1000-3290,,,ACTA PHYS SIN-CH ED,Acta Phys.

We have investigated the predictive skill of initialized hindcast simulations performed with three state-of-the-art climate prediction models within the CMIP5-framework, focusing on sea surface temperature (SST) in the Nordic Seas and Barents Sea, but also on sea ice extent, and the subpolar North Atlantic upstream. The hindcasts are compared with observation-based SST for the period 1961-2010. All models have significant predictive skill in specific regions at certain lead times. However, among the three models there is little consistency concerning which regions that display predictive skill and at what lead times. For instance, in the eastern Nordic Seas, only one model has significant skill in predicting observed SST variability at longer lead times (7-10 years). This region is of particular promise in terms of predictability, as observed thermohaline anomalies progress from the subpolar North Atlantic to the Fram Strait within the time frame of a couple of years. In the same model, predictive skill appears to move northward along a similar route as forecast time progresses. We attribute this to the northward advection of SST anomalies, contributing to skill at longer lead times in the eastern Nordic Seas. The skill at these lead times in particular beats that of persistence forecast, again indicating the potential role of ocean circulation as a source for skill. Furthermore, we discuss possible explanations for the difference in skill among models, such as different model resolutions, initialization techniques, and model climatologies and variance.","[Langehaug, H.

Spatiotemporal tonnage data from the DSNY was combined with external data sets, including the Longitudinal Employer Household Dynamics data, the American Community Survey, the New York City Department of Finance's Primary Land Use and Tax Lot Output data, and historical weather data to build a Gradient Boosting Regression Model. The model was trained on historical data from 2005 to 2011 and validation was performed both temporally and spatially. With this model, we are able to accurately (R2 > 0.88) forecast weekly MSW generation tonnages for each of the 232 geographic sections in NYC across three waste streams of refuse, paper and metal/glass/plastic. Importantly, the model identifies regularity of urban waste generation and is also able to capture very short timescale fluctuations associated to holidays, special events, seasonal variations, and weather related events.

This disease accounts for substantial economic losses in China every year. Diaphorina citri Kuwayama is one of the major vectors by which citrus HLB is spread under natural conditions in China. Research is needed to identify the geographic distribution of D. citri and its major areas of occurrence and to formulate measures for early warning, monitoring, and control of this pest and citrus HLB. Methods: In this study, the ecological niche modelling software MaxEnt (maximum entropy model) was combined with ArcGIS (a geographic information system) to predict the potential geographic distribution of D. citri in China. Key environmental factors and the appropriate ranges of their values were also investigated. Results: Our results show that the training data provided a good forecast (AUC(mean) = 0.988). The highly suitable areas for D. citri in China are mainly concentrated to the south of the Yangtze River, and the total area is 139.83 x 10(4) km(2). The area of the moderately suitable areas is 27.71 x 10(4) km(2), with a narrower distribution than that of the highly suitable area. The important environmental factors affecting the distribution of D. citri were min temperature of coldest month, mean temperature of coldest quarter, precipitation of wettest quarter, mean temperature of warmest quarter, precipitation of warmest quarter, max temperature of warmest month, and temperature seasonality. These results provide a valuable theoretical basis for risk assessments and control of D. citri. Discussion: The predicted results showed that there were highly suitable areas for D. citri in Chongqing, Hubei, Anhui, and Jiangsu. Therefore, the possibility exists for the further spread of D. citri in China in the future. Extreme temperature variables, especially the min temperature of the coldest month, play an important role in the distribution of D. citri and are most closely related to the distribution of D. citri.","[Wang, Rulin; Huang, Tingting; Li, Qing] Sichuan Agr Univ, Coll Agron, Chengdu, Sichuan, Peoples R China; [Wang, Rulin; Lu, Xingli; Zhao, Jinpeng] Sichuan Prov Rural Econ Informat Ctr, Chengdu, Sichuan, Peoples R China; [Yang, Hua] Sichuan Agr Univ, Key Lab Ecol Forestry Engn Sichuan Prov, Coll Forestry, Chengdu, Sichuan, Peoples R China; [Luo, Wei] Zigong Bur Meteorol, Zigong, Sichuan, Peoples R China; [Wang, Mingtian] Sichuan Meteorol Observ, Chengdu, Sichuan, Peoples R China; [Wang, Mingtian] Water Saving Agr Southern Hill Area Key Lab Sichu, Chengdu, Sichuan, Peoples R China",,"Wang, RL; Li, Q (corresponding author), Sichuan Agr Univ, Coll Agron, Chengdu, Sichuan, Peoples R China.; Wang, RL (corresponding author), Sichuan Prov Rural Econ Informat Ctr, Chengdu, Sichuan, Peoples R China.",398927566@qq.com; 10100@sicau.edu.cn,"WANG, Rulin/AAE-6849-2019",,Special Investigation of Asian citrus psyllid in Sichuan Province (2018); Basin Key Laboratory of Sichuan Province (Key Laboratory of Sichuan Province) [2018-Key-05-11]; Technological Development of Meteorological Administration/Heavy Rain and Drought-Flood Disasters in Plateau,"This work was financially supported by the Special Investigation of Asian citrus psyllid in Sichuan Province (2018), the Technological Development of Meteorological Administration/Heavy Rain and Drought-Flood Disasters in Plateau and Basin Key Laboratory of Sichuan Province (Key Laboratory of Sichuan Province-2018-Key-05-11).

Multivariate drought indexes can theoretically show the severity and weakness of various drought types simultaneously. This study introduces an approach for forecasting joint deficit index (JDI) and multivariate standardized precipitation index (MSPI) by using machine-learning methods and entropy theory. JDI and MSPI were calculated for the 1-12 months' time window (JDI(1-12) and MSPI1-12), using monthly precipitation data. The methods implemented for forecasting are group method of data handling (GMDH), generalized regression neural network (GRNN), least squared support vector machine (LSSVM), adaptive neuro-fuzzy inference system (ANFIS) and ANFIS optimized with three heuristic optimization algorithms, differential evolution (DE), genetic algorithm (GA) and particle swarm optimization (PSO) as meta-innovative methods (ANFIS-DE, ANFIS-GA and ANFIS-PSO). Monthly precipitation, monthly temperature and previous amounts of the index's values were used as inputs to the models. Data from 10 synoptic stations situated in the widest climatic zone of Iran (extra arid-cold climate) were employed. Optimal model inputs were selected by gamma test and entropy theory. The evaluation results, which were given using mean absolute error (MAE), root mean squared error (RMSE) and Willmott index (WI), show that the machine learning and meta-innovative models can present acceptable forecasts of general drought's conditions. The algorithms DE, GA and PSO, could improve the ANFIS's performance by 39.4%, 38.7% and 22.6%, respectively. Among all the applied models, the GMDH shows the best forecasting accuracy with MAE = 0.280, RMSE = 0.374 and WI = 0.955. In addition, the models could forecast MSPI better than JDI in the majority of cases (stations). Among the two methods used to select the optimal inputs, it is difficult to select one as a better input selector, but according to the results, more attention can be paid to entropy theory in drought studies.","[Aghelpour, Pouya; Sourmirinezhad, Zohreh] Bu Ali Sina Univ, Fac Agr, Dept Water Engn, Hamadan 6517838695, Hamadan, Iran; [Mohammadi, Babak] Hohai Univ, Coll Hydrol & Water Resources, Nanjing 210098, Peoples R China; [Biazar, Seyed Mostafa] Univ Tabriz, Fac Agr, Dept Water Engn, Tabriz 5166616471, Iran; [Kisi, Ozgur] Ilia State Univ, Dept Civil Engn, GE-0162 Tbilisi, Georgia; [Kisi, Ozgur] Duy Tan Univ, Inst Res & Dev, Da Nang 550000, Vietnam",,"Mohammadi, B (corresponding author), Hohai Univ, Coll Hydrol & Water Resources, Nanjing 210098, Peoples R China.",p.aghelpour@agr.basu.ac.ir; babak@hhu.edu.cn; SM.Biazar@tabrizu.ac.ir; ozgur.kisi@iliauni.edu.ge; z.sourmirinezhad@agr.basu.ac.ir,"Aghelpour, Pouya/AAQ-3174-2020; Biazar, Seyed Mostafa/P-8441-2018; Mohammadi, Babak/G-4012-2018","Aghelpour, Pouya/0000-0002-5640-865X; Biazar, Seyed Mostafa/0000-0002-8596-2051; Mohammadi, Babak/0000-0001-8427-5965; Kisi, Ozgur/0000-0001-7847-5872; Sourmirinezhad, Zohreh/0000-0002-4974-0574",,,,58,11,11,1,3,MDPI,BASEL,"ST ALBAN-ANLAGE 66, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND",,2220-9964,,ISPRS INT J GEO-INF,ISPRS Int.

This development is due to growing interest from a diverse set of stakeholders, such as air quality regulatory bodies, aviation and military authorities, solar energy plant managers, climate services providers, and health professionals. Owing to the complexity of atmospheric aerosol processes and their sensitivity to the underlying meteorological conditions, the prediction of aerosol particle concentrations and properties in the numerical weather prediction (NWP) framework faces a number of challenges. The modeling of numerous aerosol-related parameters increases computational expense. Errors in aerosol prediction concern all processes involved in the aerosol life cycle including (a) errors on the source terms (for both anthropogenic and natural emissions), (b) errors directly dependent on the meteorology (e.g., mixing, transport, scavenging by precipitation), and (c) errors related to aerosol chemistry (e.g., nucleation, gas-aerosol partitioning, chemical transformation and growth, hygroscopicity). Finally, there are fundamental uncertainties and significant processing overhead in the diverse observations used for verification and assimilation within these systems. Indeed, a significant component of aerosol forecast development consists in streamlining aerosol-related observations and reducing the most important errors through model development and data assimilation. Aerosol particle observations from satellite- and ground-based platforms have been crucial to guide model development of the recent years and have been made more readily available for model evaluation and assimilation. However, for the sustainability of the aerosol particle prediction activities around the globe, it is crucial that quality aerosol observations continue to be made available from different platforms (space, near surface, and aircraft) and freely shared. This paper reviews current requirements for aerosol observations in the context of the operational activities carried out at various global and regional centers. While some of the requirements are equally applicable to aerosol-climate, the focus here is on global operational prediction of aerosol properties such as mass concentrations and optical parameters. It is also recognized that the term requirements is loosely used here given the diversity in global aerosol observing systems and that utilized data are typically not from operational sources. Most operational models are based on bulk schemes that do not predict the size distribution of the aerosol particles. Others are based on a mix of bin and bulk schemes with limited capability of simulating the size information. However the next generation of aerosol operational models will output both mass and number density concentration to provide a more complete description of the aerosol population. A brief overview of the state of the art is provided with an introduction on the importance of aerosol prediction activities. The criteria on which the requirements for aerosol observations are based are also outlined. Assimilation and evaluation aspects are discussed from the perspective of the user requirements.","[Benedetti, Angela; Di Giuseppe, Francesca; Flemming, Johannes] European Ctr Medium Range Weather Forecasts, Reading, Berks, England; [Reid, Jeffrey S.] Naval Res Lab, Monterey, CA USA; [Baklanov, Alexander] World Meteorol Org, Geneva, Switzerland; [Basart, Sara; Jorba, Oriol] Barcelona Supercomp Ctr, Barcelona, Spain; [Remy, Samuel; Boucher, Olivier; Escribano, Jeronimo] Sorbonne Univ, CNRS, Inst Pierre Simon Laplace, Paris, France; [Marsham, John H.; Brooks, Ian M.] Univ Leeds, Leeds, W Yorkshire, England; [Brooks, Malcolm] UK Met Off, Exeter, Devon, England; [Colarco, Peter R.; da Silva, Arlindo] NASA, Goddard Space Flight Ctr, Greenbelt, MD 20771 USA; [Cuevas, Emilio] AEMET, Izana Atmospher Res Ctr, Santa Cruz De Tenerife, Spain; [Huneeus, Nicolas] Univ Chile, Geophys Dept, Santiago, Chile; [Huneeus, Nicolas] Ctr Climate & Resilience Res CR2, Santiago, Chile; [Kazadzis, Stelios] World Radiat Ctr, Phys Meteorol Observ Davos, Davos, Switzerland; [Kazadzis, Stelios] Natl Observ Athens, Athens, Greece; [Kinne, Stefan] Max Planck Inst Meteorol, Hamburg, Germany; [Knippertz, Peter] Karlsruhe Inst Technol, Karlsruhe, Germany; [Laj, Paolo] Univ Grenoble Alpes, Grenoble INP, CNRS, IGE,IRD, Grenoble, France; [Marsham, John H.] Natl Ctr Atmospher Sci, Leeds, W Yorkshire, England; [Menut, Laurent] UPMC Univ Paris 06, Lab Meteorol Dynam, Ecole Normale Super,CNRS, Ecole Polytech,IPSL Res Univ,Univ Paris Saclay,So, Palaiseau, France; [Mona, Lucia; Pappalardo, Gelsomina] CNR, IMAA, Tito, PZ, Italy; [Popp, Thomas] German Aerosp Ctr DLR, German Remote Sensing Data Ctr Atmosphere, Oberpfaffenhofen, Germany; [Sekiyama, Thomas T.; Tanaka, Taichu] Japan Meteorol Agcy Meteorol Res Inst, Tsukuba, Ibaraki, Japan; [Terradellas, Enric] Spanish Meteorol Agcy, AEMET, Barcelona, Spain; [Wiedensohler, Alfred] Leibniz Inst Tropospher Res, Leipzig, Germany; [Quinn, Patricia K.] NOAA, Pacific Marine Environm Lab, 7600 Sand Point Way Ne, Seattle, WA 98115 USA; [Laj, Paolo] Univ Helsinki, Dept Phys, Helsinki, Finland",,"Benedetti, A (corresponding author), European Ctr Medium Range Weather Forecasts, Reading, Berks, England.",a.benedetti@ecmwf.int,"Brooks, Melissa E/E-7466-2011; Knippertz, Peter/D-5861-2016; Jorba, Oriol/AAW-2134-2020; Marsham, John/AAA-2277-2020; Cuevas, Emilio/L-2109-2013; Colarco, Peter R/D-8637-2012; Menut, Laurent/O-2296-2016; Sekiyama, Tsuyoshi Thomas/O-4718-2018; Reid, Jeffrey S/B-7633-2014; Quinn, Patricia/R-1493-2016; Boucher, Olivier/J-5810-2012; Brooks, Ian M/E-1378-2012; Baklanov, Alexander/AAB-7460-2022; Kazadzis, Stelios/A-5628-2011","Brooks, Melissa E/0000-0002-4773-8630; Knippertz, Peter/0000-0001-9856-619X; Jorba, Oriol/0000-0001-5872-0244; Cuevas, Emilio/0000-0003-1843-8302; Colarco, Peter R/0000-0003-3525-1662; Menut, Laurent/0000-0001-9776-0812; Sekiyama, Tsuyoshi Thomas/0000-0002-1843-4291; Reid, Jeffrey S/0000-0002-5147-7955; Quinn, Patricia/0000-0003-0337-4895; Boucher, Olivier/0000-0003-2328-5769; Brooks, Ian M/0000-0002-5051-1322; Baklanov, Alexander/0000-0002-5396-8440; Kazadzis, Stelios/0000-0002-8624-8247; Escribano, Jeronimo/0000-0001-9682-7624; Tanaka, Taichu Yasumichi/0000-0003-0600-2122; Basart, Sara/0000-0002-9821-8504; Di Giuseppe, Francesca/0000-0001-9829-0429","H2020 Aerosols, Clouds, and Trace gases Research InfraStructure (ACTRIS2) [654109]; AXA Research Fund; European UnionEuropean Commission [603502]; NERC SWAMMA project [RG.EVEA.103394]; Office of Naval ResearchOffice of Naval Research [322]; NOAA PMELNational Oceanic Atmospheric Admin (NOAA) - USA [4739]; Copernicus Atmosphere Monitoring Service; FONDAP [15110009]; NERCUK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Natural Environment Research Council (NERC) [ncas10003, NE/L005352/1, NE/P021077/1] Funding Source: UKRI","We gratefully acknowledge Oksana Tarasova (WMO) for supporting this initiative and encouraging the Scientific Advisory Group on Aerosols to take the lead in writing this paper.

Although much of the year-to-year variability in the jet stream arises from internal atmospheric processes that are inherently unpredictable on timescales beyond a few days to weeks, any low-frequency variability or long-term trends that can be considered forced by slowly varying boundary conditions offer the potential for extended range predictability of climatological conditions in western Europe. Here we demonstrate that station-based precipitation observations have displayed pronounced multidecadal variability over the past century in western Europe during the late winter. We then use these precipitation observations as an independent verification of the multidecadal Atlantic jet stream variability found in reanalysis products. Both signals are highly correlated with sea surface temperature variability in the North Atlantic that is well predicted in initialized decadal prediction experiments with a coupled general circulation model. Combining the model-based predictions of the sea surface temperature with the observed relationship between precipitation and sea surface temperature, we show that there is great potential for skilful predictions of the forthcoming decadal average of March precipitation in western Europe, with hindcasts for the UK and Portugal yielding anomaly correlation coefficients of 0.82 and 0.69, respectively.","[Simpson, Isla R.; Yeager, Stephen G.; Deser, Clara] Natl Ctr Atmospher Res, Climate & Global Dynam Lab, POB 3000, Boulder, CO 80307 USA; [McKinnon, Karen A.] Univ Calif Los Angeles, Dept Stat, Inst Environm & Sustainabil, Los Angeles, CA USA",,"Simpson, IR (corresponding author), Natl Ctr Atmospher Res, Climate & Global Dynam Lab, POB 3000, Boulder, CO 80307 USA.",islas@ucar.edu,"Simpson, Isla/AAI-7589-2020","McKinnon, Karen/0000-0003-3314-8442; Simpson, Isla/0000-0002-2915-1377",National Science Foundation (NSF)National Science Foundation (NSF); National Center for Atmospheric Research - NSF [1852977]; NSF Collaborative Research EaSM2 Grant [OCE-1243015],"The CESM project is supported primarily by the National Science Foundation (NSF).

The idea is to replace expensive numerical integration of complex coupled partial differential equations at fine time scales performed on supercomputers, with machine-learned surrogates that efficiently and accurately forecast future system states using data sampled from the underlying system. One particularly popular technique being explored within the weather and climate modelling community is the echo state network (ESN), an attractive alternative to other well-known deep learning architectures. Using the classical Lorenz 63 system, and the three tier multi-scale Lorenz 96 system (Thomes T, Duben P, Palmer T. 2017 Q. J. R. Meteorol. Soc. 143, 897-908. (doi:10.1002/qj.2974)) as benchmarks, we realize that previously studied state-of-the-art ESNs operate in two distinct regimes, corresponding to low and high spectral radius (LSR/HSR) for the sparse, randomly generated, reservoir recurrence matrix. Using knowledge of the mathematical structure of the Lorenz systems along with systematic ablation and hyperparameter sensitivity analyses, we show that state-of-the-art LSR-ESNs reduce to a polynomial regression model which we call Domain-Driven Regularized Regression (D2R2). Interestingly, D2R2 is a generalization of the well-known SINDy algorithm (Brunton SL, Proctor JL, Kutz JN. 2016 Proc. Natl Acad. Sci. USA 113, 39323937. (doi:10.1073/pnas.1517384113)). We also show experimentally that LSR-ESNs (Chattopadhyay A, Hassanzadeh P, Subramanian D. 2019 (http://arxiv.org/abs/1906.08829)) outperform HSR ESNs (Pathak J, Hunt B, Girvan M, Lu Z, Ott E. 2018 Phys. Rev. Lett. 120, 024102. (doi:10.1103/PhysRevLett.120.024102)) while D2R2 dominates both approaches. A significant goal in constructing surrogates is to cope with barriers to scaling in weather prediction and simulation of dynamical systems that are imposed by time and energy consumption in supercomputers. Inexact computing has emerged as a novel approach to helping with scaling. In this paper, we evaluate the performance of three models (LSR-ESN, HSR-ESN and D2R2) by varying the precision or word size of the computation as our inexactness-controlling parameter. For precisions of 64, 32 and 16 bits, we show that, surprisingly, the least expensive D2R2 method yields the most robust results and the greatest savings compared to ESNs. Specifically, D2R2 achieves 68x in computational savings, with an additional 2x if precision reductions are also employed, outperforming ESN variants by a large margin.

Variable selection assists in determining factors associated with disease transmission, however, often overlooked in this process is the evaluation and suitability of the statistical model used in forecasting disease transmission and outbreaks. Here we aim to evaluate several modelling methods to optimise predictive modelling of Ross River virus (RRV) disease notifications and outbreaks in epidemiological important regions of Victoria and Western Australia. Methodology/Principal findings We developed several statistical methods using meteorological and RRV surveillance data from July 2000 until June 2018 in Victoria and from July 1991 until June 2018 in Western Australia. Models were developed for 11 Local Government Areas (LGAs) in Victoria and seven LGAs in Western Australia. We found generalised additive models and generalised boosted regression models, and generalised additive models and negative binomial models to be the best fit models when predicting RRV outbreaks and notifications, respectively. No association was found with a models' ability to predict RRV notifications in LGAs with greater RRV activity, or for outbreak predictions to have a higher accuracy in LGAs with greater RRV notifications. Moreover, we assessed the use of factor analysis to generate independent variables used in predictive modelling. However, this approach did not result in as many best fit models than when not using this approach. Conclusions/Significance We demonstrate that models which are developed and used for predicting disease notifications may not be suitable for predicting disease outbreaks, or visa versa. Furthermore, poor predictive performance in modelling disease transmissions may be the result of inappropriate model selection methods. Our findings provide approaches and methods to facilitate the selection of the best fit statistical model for predicting mosquito-borne disease notifications and outbreaks used for disease surveillance. Author summary Mosquito-borne diseases cause significant illness worldwide. Mosquito breeding which leads to disease transmission is driven by favorable climatic and meteorological events (i.e., rainfall and warm temperatures). Understanding the association meteorological conditions have with mosquito breeding aids in directing mosquito control activities when there is a likelihood of disease transmission. Predictive models are used in public health decision making and resource allocation to guide mosquito control programs. However, there are multiple modelling methods all of which provide differing degrees of accuracy in their predictions and suitability to the disease transmission dynamics. This study aims to assess commonly used statistical models for predicting mosquito-borne disease notifications and outbreaks. We demonstrate that statistical model selection plays an important role in accurately forecasting mosquito-borne disease and poor predictive performance may be due to inappropriate model selection. Furthermore, a model suited to predicting disease notifications may not always be the best model to accurately predict the occurrence of disease outbreaks. The methods used here can aid in public health to establish suitable predictive mosquito-borne disease surveillance systems to help guide disease prevention and resource allocation, and mosquito control activities.","[Koolhof, Iain S.; Bettiol, Silvana] Univ Tasmania, Coll Hlth & Med, Sch Med, Hobart, Tas, Australia; [Koolhof, Iain S.; Charleston, Michael; Carver, Scott] Univ Tasmania, Sch Nat Sci, Hobart, Tas, Australia; [Firestone, Simon M.] Univ Melbourne, Fac Vet & Agr Sci, Melbourne Vet Sch, Melbourne, Vic, Australia; [Gibney, Katherine B.; Neville, Peter J.] Victorian Dept Hlth & Human Serv, Hlth Protect Branch, Communicable Dis Epidemiol & Surveillance, Melbourne, Vic, Australia; [Neville, Peter J.; Jardine, Andrew] Dept Hlth, Publ & Aboriginal Hlth Div, Environm Hlth Directorate, Perth, WA, Australia",,"Koolhof, IS (corresponding author), Univ Tasmania, Coll Hlth & Med, Sch Med, Hobart, Tas, Australia.; Koolhof, IS (corresponding author), Univ Tasmania, Sch Nat Sci, Hobart, Tas, Australia.",koolhofi@utas.edu.au,"; Charleston, Michael/O-4903-2017; bettiol, silvana/J-7606-2014; Carver, Scott/J-7654-2014","Koolhof, Iain/0000-0002-9923-7416; Charleston, Michael/0000-0001-8385-341X; Gibney, Katherine/0000-0001-5851-5339; Neville, Peter/0000-0003-0823-6934; bettiol, silvana/0000-0002-4355-4498; Firestone, Simon/0000-0002-3239-1419; Carver, Scott/0000-0002-3579-7588",,,,43,0,0,2,2,PUBLIC LIBRARY SCIENCE,SAN FRANCISCO,"1160 BATTERY STREET, STE 100, SAN FRANCISCO, CA 94111 USA",1935-2735,,,PLOS NEGLECT TROP D,Plos Neglect.

This represents a further step towards a vision of simulating the numerous interactions and feedbacks between different physical and biogeochemical components of the environment across sky, sea and land using more integrated regional coupled prediction systems at kilometre-scale resolution. The UKC3 coupled system incorporates models of the atmosphere (Met Office Unified Model), land surface with river routing (JULES), shelf-sea ocean (NEMO) and ocean surface waves (WAVEWATCH III (R)), coupled together using OASIS3-MCT libraries. The major update introduced since the UKC2 configuration is an explicit representation of wave-ocean feedbacks through introduction of wave-to-ocean coupling. Ocean model results demonstrate that wave coupling, in particular representing the wave-modified surface drag, has a small but positive improvement on the agreement between simulated sea surface temperatures and in situ observations, relative to simulations without wave feedbacks. Other incremental developments to the coupled modelling capability introduced since the UKC2 configuration are also detailed. Coupled regional prediction systems are of interest for applications across a range of timescales, from hours to decades ahead. The first results from four simulation experiments, each of the order of 1 month in duration, are analysed and discussed in the context of characterizing the potential bene-fits of coupled prediction on forecast skill. Results across atmosphere, ocean and wave components are shown to be stable over time periods of weeks. The coupled approach shows notable improvements in surface temperature, wave state (in near-coastal regions) and wind speed over the sea, whereas the prediction quality of other quantities shows no significant improvement or degradation relative to the equivalent uncoupled control simulations.","[Lewis, Huw W.; Sanchez, Juan Manuel Castillo; Arnold, Alex; Fallmann, Joachim; Saulter, Andrew; Graham, Jennifer; Bush, Mike; Siddorn, John; Palmer, Tamzin; Lock, Adrian; Edwards, John] Met Off, Exeter EX1 3PB, Devon, England; [Bricheno, Lucy] Natl Oceanog Ctr, Liverpool L3 5DA, Merseyside, England; [Martinez-de la Torre, Alberto] Ctr Ecol Hydrol, Wallingford OX10 8BB, Oxon, England; [Clark, James] Plymouth Marine Lab, Plymouth PL1 2LP, Devon, England; [Fallmann, Joachim] Johannes Gutenberg Univ Mainz, Inst Phys Atmosphare, Mainz, Germany; [Graham, Jennifer] Ctr Environm Fisheries & Aquaculture Sci, Pakefield Rd, Lowestoft NR33 0HT, Suffolk, England",,"Lewis, HW (corresponding author), Met Off, Exeter EX1 3PB, Devon, England.",huw.lewis@metoffice.gov.uk,"Fallmann, Joachim/AAE-2470-2021","Fallmann, Joachim/0000-0002-3099-0266; Graham, Jennifer/0000-0002-1950-5266; Martinez-de la Torre, Alberto/0000-0003-0244-5348",Centre for Ecology & Hydrology (CEH); the Met Office; National Oceanography Centre (NOC); Plymouth Marine Laboratory (PML)UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Natural Environment Research Council (NERC); NERCUK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Natural Environment Research Council (NERC) [noc010010] Funding Source: UKRI,"This research has been carried out under national capability funding as part of a directed effort on UK Environmental Prediction, in collaboration between Centre for Ecology & Hydrology (CEH), the Met Office, National Oceanography Centre (NOC) and Plymouth Marine Laboratory (PML).",,110,20,20,1,3,COPERNICUS GESELLSCHAFT MBH,GOTTINGEN,"BAHNHOFSALLEE 1E, GOTTINGEN, 37081, GERMANY",1991-959X,1991-9603,,GEOSCI MODEL DEV,Geosci.

The aim of the research is mathematical analysis and forecasting of dispersive soils behaviour based on the study of inclinometric observations data in the area of the natural-technical system of the Dnister PSPP. Methodology. The research methodology is based on mathematical analysis and modelling of processes occurring in the mountain massif on which the Dnister PSPP is located, using the finite element method. Results. The paper presents an analysis of the results of geotechnical monitoring of the behaviour of dispersive soils, implemented on the basis of inclinometric measurements on the territory of the Dnister PSPP. Quantitative parameters of horizontal displacement distribution in inclinometric wells are established. They made it possible to detect negative dynamics in the geological horizons N(1-2)ap and N(1)p+v, which is apparently caused by technogenic load caused by the Dnister upper reservoir. The behaviour of dispersive soils under the influence of natural and technogenic loads has been modelled. Based on the simulation results, the change of the sign of deformations under the influence of additional load, which can be the filling of the Dnister upper reservoir, is confirmed. Obviously, the use of this method alone does not allow full detecting and tracking modern geological, seismic and geodynamic processes. A combination and detailed analysis of different monitoring methods (geophysical, geodetic, parametric, vibrometric, hydrogeological, temperature, visual-instrumental and others), as well as modelling the behaviour of the object under the influence of natural and technogenic factors is optimal. Such simulations could be used in the design of other objects of this type, so this is a promising area for further research. Originality. For the first time, a mathematical analysis and forecasting of the behaviour of dispersed soils in the area of the natural and technical system of the Dnister PSPP was conducted on the basis of studying the data of inclinometric observations. Practical significance. The proposed technique can be used in the design of other objects of this type, as modelling the behaviour of the object under the influence of natural and technogenic factors makes it possible to assess possible risks and prevent them.","[Zyhar, Andrii; Yushchenko, Yuriy; Pasichnyk, Mykola] Yuriy Fedkovych Chemivtsi Natl Univ, 2 Kotsyubynskoho Str, UA-58012 Chernovtsy, Ukraine; [Savchyn, Ihor] Lviv Polytech Natl Univ, Inst Geodesy, 6 Karpinski Str, UA-79013 Lvov, Ukraine",,"Zyhar, A (corresponding author), Yuriy Fedkovych Chemivtsi Natl Univ, 2 Kotsyubynskoho Str, UA-58012 Chernovtsy, Ukraine.",,"Savchyn, Ihor/AAH-2774-2019","Savchyn, Ihor/0000-0002-5859-1515",,,,30,0,0,0,0,LVIV POLYTECHNIC NATL UNIV,LVIV,"ST S BANDERA, 12, LVIV, 13, UKRAINE",1992-142X,2519-2663,,GEODYNAMICS,Geodynamics,,2021,,30,,,,,17,24,,10.23939/jgd2021.01.017,,,8,Geochemistry & Geophysics,Emerging Sources Citation Index (ESCI),Geochemistry & Geophysics,XY2FK,WOS:000736794800002,,Bronze,,,2022-02-17

The newly exposed Playa substrate can emit large amounts of particulate matter (PM) and thus degrade regional air quality. We use the Weather Research Forecast model (WRF-Chem) to estimate changes in dust aerosol emission and distribution in the Salton Sea region from 2000 to 2030. First, we evaluate simulations of present day wind speed, mineral dust emission, concentration, and optical depth over the region. WRF-Chem at 4 km spatial resolution satisfactorily reproduces the present-day spatio-temporal pattern of dust emission. With an estimated 38% exposure of the Salton Sea by 2030, the domain-averaged PM10 in the 2 x 2 degree domain enclosing the Sea increases on average by 11% and by nearly a factor of ten in localized source areas. The simulated increases in dust emission are consistent with earlier empirical estimates although our estimates are comparatively lower. Our regional model provides more spatially detailed and quantitative attribution of the projected air quality degradation. For example, our model suggests that newly exposed playa emissions will emanate more from the southwest than southeast side of the lake, even though most of the new playa will be on the southeast side. These results may inform decisions that affect trade-offs between environmental quality, human health, and water-use issues in the Salton Sea region.","[Parajuli, Sagar P.] KAUST, Thuwal, Saudi Arabia; [Zender, Charles S.] Univ Calif Irvine, Dept Earth Syst Sci, Irvine, CA USA",,"Parajuli, SP (corresponding author), KAUST, Thuwal, Saudi Arabia.",psagar@utexas.edu,"Zender, Charles S/D-4485-2012; Parajuli, Sagar/AAB-3679-2020","Zender, Charles S/0000-0003-0129-8024; Parajuli, Sagar/0000-0002-6683-7271",NASA ACCESSNational Aeronautics & Space Administration (NASA) [NNX14AH55A]; DOE ACME [DE-SC0012998]; Borrego Valley Endowment Fund,"Station winds and PM10 data were downloaded from Air Quality and Meteorological Information System (AQMIS) of Air Resources Board (ARB), California from the website https://www.arb.ca.gov/aqmis2/aqmis2.php.

Wintertime precipitation is crucial for regional water resources, agriculture, and livelihood; however, in recent years droughts have been a notable feature of CSWA interannual variability. Here, the predictability of CSWA wintertime precipitation is explored based on its time-lagged relationship with the preceding months' (September-October) sea surface temperature (SST), using a canonical correlation analysis (CCA) approach. For both periods, results indicate that for CSWA much of the seasonal predictability arises from SST variations in the Pacific related to El Nino-Southern Oscillation (ENSO) and the Pacific decadal oscillation (PDO). Additional sources of skill that play a weaker predictive role include long-term SST trends, North Atlantic variability, and regional teleconnections. CCA cross-validation skill shows that the regional potential predictability has a strong dependency on the ENSO phenomenon, and the strengthening (weakening) of this relationship yields forecasts with higher (lower) predictive skill. This finding is validated by the mean cross-validated correlation skill of 0.71 and 0.38 obtained for the 1980/81-2014/15 and 1950/51-2014/15 CCA analyses, respectively. The development of cold (warm) ENSO conditions during September-October, in combination with cold (warm) PDO conditions, is associated with a northward (southward) shift of the jet stream and a strong tendency of negative (positive) winter precipitation anomalies; other sources of predictability influence the regional precipitation directly during non-ENSO years or by modulating the impact of ENSO teleconnection based on their relative strengths.","[Rana, Sapna; Renwick, James; McGregor, James] Victoria Univ Wellington, Sch Geog Environm & Earth Sci, Wellington, New Zealand; [Singh, Ankita] Indian Inst Technol, Sch Earth Ocean & Climate Sci, Bhubaneswar, Orissa, India",,"Rana, S (corresponding author), Victoria Univ Wellington, Sch Geog Environm & Earth Sci, Wellington, New Zealand.",sapna.rana@vuw.ac.nz,,,"Victoria University of Wellington (VUW), New Zealand; VUW","The authors would like to extend their sincere thanks to the Victoria University of Wellington (VUW), New Zealand for supporting this research.

Object deformation monitoring is a task of geodetic and civil engineers who use different instruments and methods for measurements. Only geodetic methods have been used for the object movement analysis in this research. Although the whole object is affected by the influencing factors, different parts of the object react differently. Hence, one model cannot describe behaviour of every part of the object precisely. In this research, a localised approach is presented-two individual models are developed for every point strategically placed on the object: one model for the analysis and prediction in the direction of the X axis and the other for the Y axis. Additionally, the prediction of horizontal dam movement is not performed directly from measured values of influencing factors, but from predicted values obtained by machine learning and statistical methods. The results of this research show that it is possible to perform accurate short-term time series dam movement prediction by using machine learning and statistical methods and that the only limiting factor for improving prediction length is accurate weather forecast.","[Hamzic, Adis] Publ Enterprise Elect Util Bosnia & Herzegovina, Dept Tech Monitoring Hydro Power Plants Neretva R, Jablanica 88420, Bosnia & Herceg; [Avdagic, Zikrija; Besic, Ingmar] Univ Sarajevo, Fac Elect Engn, Sarajevo 71000, Bosnia & Herceg",,"Hamzic, A (corresponding author), Publ Enterprise Elect Util Bosnia & Herzegovina, Dept Tech Monitoring Hydro Power Plants Neretva R, Jablanica 88420, Bosnia & Herceg.",hamzicadis87@gmail.com; zikrija.avdagic@etf.unsa.ba; ingmar.besic@etf.unsa.ba,"Besic, Ingmar/V-2306-2019; AVDAGIC, ZIKRIJA/AAE-6180-2020","Besic, Ingmar/0000-0003-1632-570X; AVDAGIC, ZIKRIJA/0000-0002-0933-2699",Bosnia and Herzegovina-Federal Ministry of Education and Science,"We express the most appreciation to the Public Enterprise Electric Utility of Bosnia and Herzegovina for permission and supplying data used in this research.

In this study, the impact of control variable choices in assimilating DWR observations for improving the forecast of heavy rainfall event is analysed. For this purpose radar reflectivity and radial velocity, observations are assimilated using stream function velocity potential (psi chi) and horizontal wind components (uv) control variable options in Weather Research and Forecast model - 3DVAR (three-dimensional variational assimilation system).

In this study, an autodetection method was used to identify ARs that reached the NANC, based on the 6-hourly data of the ERA-Interim reanalysis conducted by the European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts, in summer and autumn from 1979 to 2016. Stronger ARs tended to occur in the eastern flank of a cyclonic anomaly that covered the entire North American east coast from Florida to Newfoundland, with a positive precipitation anomaly over the NANC. The cyclonic anomalies and precipitation in autumn were stronger but less frequent than those in summer. Cyclonic anomalies were parts of westward-tilting wavelike circulation perturbations moving into North America from the extratropical North Pacific and moving continuously eastward, reaching the east coast in approximately five days. The Geophysical Fluid Dynamics Laboratory (GFDL) High-Resolution Atmospheric Model (HiRAM), which realistically simulates the occurrence frequency and key characteristics of ARs in current climatic conditions, was used to project the AR activity and corresponding circulations in the future warmer climate under the representative concentration pathway 8.5 scenario. The HiRAM that was driven by sea surface temperature changes projected an overall increase in the occurrence of stronger ARs in both summer and autumn and the precipitation strength in autumn along the NANC by the end of the twenty-first century. This projected enhancement was contributed to by two processes-a smaller contribution was from the weakened basin-scale North Atlantic anticyclone but with higher moisture content, and a larger contribution was from the enhancement in anomalous circulation during AR events with integrated vapor transport exceeding the 75th percentile. These results suggest that the influence of strong ARs on the NANC may increase in the warmer future due to the combination of increased water vapor in the large-scale environment (thermodynamic effect) and enhanced anomalous circulations (dynamic effect). The AR-associated circulations in autumn were also projected to have a stronger tropical connection in the warmer future.","[Hsu, Huang-Hsiung; Chen, Ying-Ting] Acad Sinica, Res Ctr Environm Changes, Taipei, Taiwan",,"Hsu, HH (corresponding author), Acad Sinica, Res Ctr Environm Changes, Taipei, Taiwan.",hhhsu@gate.sinica.edu.tw,"Hsu, Huang-Hsiung/AAP-3878-2021","Hsu, Huang-Hsiung/0000-0001-9919-4404","Ministry of Sciences and Technology (Taiwan) [MOST 108-2119-M-001-014, MOST 107-2119-M-001-010]",We are grateful to G.

However, the forecasting error is inevitable, and it is influenced by the input, the structural parameters and many human factors, it is not only random, but also has great fuzziness. Therefore, it is very important to study the fuzziness of runoff forecasting error and reveal its fuzzy distribution law to guide the actual operation of hydropower station. In view of this, this paper has carried out research work in the following two aspects. At the theoretical level, in order to make the establishment of fuzzy set more objective and scientific, based on different theoretical fuzzy distribution functions and the parameter optimization method, an overall framework of fuzzy membership function optimization model is proposed by coupling the optimal closeness criterion, which can make full use of the guiding role of practical experience and at the same time effectively avoid the difficulty of subjective choice. At the practical level, in order to quantify the fuzzy characteristics of runoff forecasting error, a quantification method for runoff forecasting error in fuzzy environment is proposed based on the Hamming closeness, Cauchy distribution, Normal distribution and Cusp Gamma distribution. Taking the Jinxi hydropower station of Yalong River basin as the research object, the fuzzy membership functions of the fuzzy sets of runoff forecasting error under different flow intervals are calculated and optimized by the proposed method. The results show that the optimized Cusp r distribution can fit the actual data points better compared with Cauchy distribution and Normal distribution, and its average closeness can reach 0.979. So, the accurate mathematical expression of the fuzzy distribution law of runoff forecasting error under different flow intervals is well realized, which provides a good basis for the fuzzy risk analysis of hydropower station operation.","[Jiang, Zhiqiang; Qin, Hui; Hu, Dechao] Huazhong Univ Sci & Technol, Sch Hydropower & Informat Engn, Wuhan 430074, Hubei, Peoples R China; [Wu, Wenjie] Changjiang Survey Planning Design & Res CO LTD, Wuhan 430015, Hubei, Peoples R China; [Zhang, Hairong] China Yangtze Power Co Ltd, Yichang 443133, Peoples R China",,"Jiang, ZQ (corresponding author), Huazhong Univ Sci & Technol, Sch Hydropower & Informat Engn, Wuhan 430074, Hubei, Peoples R China.",zqjzq@hust.edu.cn,,,"Natural Science Foundation of ChinaNational Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC) [51809098, 91647114]; National Key R&D Program of China [2017YFC0405900]; CRSRI Open Research Program [SN: CKWV2016371/KY]; Fundamental Research Funds for the Central UniversitiesFundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities [HUST: 2017KFYXJJ 198, HUST: 2016YXZD047]","This study was financially supported by the Natural Science Foundation of China (51809098; 91647114), the National Key R&D Program of China (2017YFC0405900), the CRSRI Open Research Program (Program SN: CKWV2016371/KY), and the Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities (HUST: 2017KFYXJJ 198 and HUST: 2016YXZD047).

Here, we established a model using material flow analysis method based on life cycle assessment to follow plastic product from primary plastic to plastic waste with statistical data and monitoring data from accurate sources. This model can be used to estimate and forecast the annual input of plastic waste into the sea from China until 2020. In 2011, 0.547 3-0.751 5 million tons of plastic waste entered the seas in China, with a growth rate of 4.55% per year until 2017. And the amount will decrease to 0.257 1 to 0.353 1 million tons in 2020 under the influence of governmental management. The amount of plastic waste discharged from coastal areas calculated in this study was much larger than that from river, thus it is suggested to strengthen the governance and control of plastic waste in coastal fishery activities in China in order to reduce the amount of marine plastic waste input.","[Bai Mengyu; Zhu Lixin; Peng Guyu; Li Daoji] East China Normal Univ, State Key Lab Estuarine & Coastal Res, Shanghai 200062, Peoples R China; [An Lihui] Chinese Res Inst Environm Sci, State Environm Protect Key Lab Estuarine & Coasta, Beijing 100012, Peoples R China",,"Li, DJ (corresponding author), East China Normal Univ, State Key Lab Estuarine & Coastal Res, Shanghai 200062, Peoples R China.",daojili@sklec.ecnu.edu.cn,,,,,,76,13,18,19,121,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"233 SPRING ST, NEW YORK, NY 10013 USA",0253-505X,1869-1099,,ACTA OCEANOL SIN,Acta Oceanol.

Notwithstanding the potential use of meteorological and air quality modelling to characterize the air pollution problems, little attention has been paid to meteorological model configuration and its impact on air quality modelling applications over the region. Aiming to find the most suitable set of parameterization schemes of the Advanced Research Weather Research and Forecasting (WRF-ARW) model for air quality modelling applications over the PRD region, a performance experiment was performed. Three tests, with different combinations of parameterization schemes, were created and evaluated. For the best configuration modelling setup, meteorological simulations for a winter (i.e. January) and summer (i.e. July) periods are provided. The meteorological model showed a clockwise deviation for the wind direction and tends to overestimate the temperature and wind speed. It is expected that the present work could reduce the meteorological and air quality modelling uncertainty over the PRD region.","[Lopes, D.; Hoi, K. I.; Yuen, K. V.; Mok, K.

Importantly, the simulated impacts are time-scale dependent such that impacts in subseasonal and seasonal forecasts cannot be extrapolated to climate time scales. In general, mean biases are reduced in HRO relative to LRO configurations and the impact is increased at longer lead times. At subseasonal to seasonal lead times, surface heating anomalies over the Gulf Stream are associated with local increases to the poleward heat flux associated with transient atmospheric eddies. In contrast, surface heating anomalies in climate experiments are balanced by changes to the time-mean surface winds that resemble the steady response under linear dynamics. Some aspects of air-sea interaction exhibit a clear improvement with increased resolution at all lead times. However, it is difficult to identify the impact of increased ocean eddy activity in the variability of the overlying atmosphere. In particular, atmospheric blocking and the intensity of the storm track respond more strongly to mean biases and thus have a larger response at longer lead times. Finally, increased ocean resolution drives improvements to subseasonal predictability over Europe. This increase in skill seems to be a result of improvements to the Madden-Julian oscillation and its associated teleconnections rather than changes to air-sea interaction in the North Atlantic region.","[Roberts, C.

The data when used as it is in hydrological forecasting may create uncertainty in hydrological models, especially in data-driven models which fully rely upon the input-output data. The current research provides a simple preprocessing approach to improve the performance of ANN-based streamflow estimation models through providing a better input state. The two-step preprocessing approach includes; the data transformation through a family of power transformation, the Box-Cox transformation, and the selection of appropriate input variables through the Gamma Test. The original data, which is essentially antecedent upland catchment information of thirteen stations located in Upper Indus Basin (UIB), comprises of twenty inputs, including precipitation, solar radiation and discharge. The Box-Cox transformation has been applied to prepare a transformed data-set and the power factor, lambda, (with best value of 0.005), for this transformation, has been determined using probability plots and histogram characteristics. Input combination selection procedure is carried out in WinGamma environment with the help of Genetic Algorithm (GA). Two-layer ANN models have been trained through Broyden, Fletcher and Goldfrab Shano (BFGS) training algorithm for both original and transformed data-sets. The comparison of models clearly indicate that the models developed through transformed data-set showed better performance in both training and testing phases with high values of NSE and R-2 which is above 90% in most of the cases, and less other statistical errors including RMSE, VARIANCE and BIAS.

We use environmental and Ross River virus (RRV) surveillance to predict weekly outbreak probabilities and incidence spanning tropical, semi-arid, and Mediterranean regions of Western Australia (1991-2014). Hurdle and linear models were used to predict outbreak probabilities and incidence respectively, using time-lagged environmental variables. Forecast accuracy was assessed by model fit and cross-validation. Residual RRV notification data were also examined against mitigation expenditure for one site, Mandurah 2007-2014. Models were predictive of RRV activity, except at one site (Capel). Minimum temperature was an important predictor of RRV outbreaks and incidence at all predicted sites. Precipitation was more likely to cause outbreaks and greater incidence among tropical and semi-arid sites. While variable, mitigation expenditure coincided positively with increased RRV incidence (r(2) = 0.21). Our research demonstrates capacity to accurately predict mosquito-borne disease outbreaks and incidence at fine-temporal resolutions. We apply our findings, developing a user-friendly tool enabling managers to easily adopt this research to forecast region-specific RRV outbreaks and incidence.

We develop a reservoir model to calculate the hydrologic conditions associated with the activity of 902 saltwater disposal wells injecting into the Arbuckle aquifer. Estimates of basement fault stressing conditions inform a rate-and-state friction earthquake nucleation model to forecast the seismic response to injection. Our model replicates many salient features of the induced earthquake sequence, including the onset of seismicity, the timing of the peak seismicity rate, and the reduction in seismicity following decreased disposal activity. We present evidence for variable time lags between changes in injection and seismicity rates, consistent with the prediction from rate-and-state theory that seismicity rate transients occur over timescales inversely proportional to stressing rate. Given the efficacy of the hydromechanical model, as confirmed through a likelihood statistical test, the results of this study support broader integration of earthquake physics within seismic hazard analysis. Plain Language Summary Earthquake activity has surged in parts of Oklahoma and Kansas, a region of the United States that historically has remained tectonically inactive. Three earthquakes with magnitude equal to or larger than 5 occurred in 2016, and researchers believe the seismic hazard in this part of the country remains high. The decade-long earthquake sequence has been attributed to subsurface disposal of salt water related to oil and gas industrial activity. In this study, we develop a model based on fluid flow and earthquake physics to link historic injection trends with the observed patterns in seismicity. Our model reproduces important characteristics of the earthquake sequences, providing an improved understanding of the fundamental processes that control induced seismicity. Our study has implications for informing induced seismicity mitigation strategies in a region currently experiencing elevated seismic hazard.","[Norbeck, J. H.; Rubinstein, J.

This was accomplished through a prospective, multisite, observational study in 8 community pharmacy practices with adults receiving an influenza vaccine with a documented vaccination forecast review from October 22, 2015 through March 22, 2016. When patients presented for influenza vaccinations, pharmacists utilized immunization information systems (IIS) data at the point of care to identify unmet vaccination needs, educate patients, and improve vaccination rates. The main outcome measures were the number of vaccination forecast reviews, patients educated, unmet vaccination needs identified and resolved, and vaccines administered. Pharmacists reviewed vaccination forecasts generated by clinical decision-support technology based on patient information documented in the IIS for 1080 patients receiving influenza vaccinations. The vaccination forecasts predicted there were 1566 additional vaccinations due at the time patients were receiving the influenza vaccine. Pharmacist assessments identified 36 contraindications and 196 potential duplications, leaving a net of 1334 unmet vaccination needs eligible for vaccination. In all, 447 of the 1334 unmet vaccinations needs were resolved during the 6-month study period, and the remainder of patients received information about their vaccination needs and recommendations to follow up for their vaccinations. Integration of streamlined principle-centered processes of care in immunization practices that allow pharmacists to utilize actionable point-of-care data resulted in identification of unmet vaccination needs, education of patients about their vaccination needs, a 41.4% increase in the number of vaccines administered, and significant improvements in routinely recommended adult vaccination rates.","[Bluml, Benjamin M.] Amer Pharmacists Assoc Fdn, 2215 Constitut Ave NW, Washington, DC 20037 USA; [Brock, Kelly A.] KB Pharm Solut Inc, Tustin, CA USA; [Hamstra, Scott; Tonrey, Lisa] US PHS, Tucson, AZ USA; [Tonrey, Lisa] Tonrey Consulting Grp, Tucson, AZ USA",,"Bluml, BM (corresponding author), Amer Pharmacists Assoc Fdn, 2215 Constitut Ave NW, Washington, DC 20037 USA.",bbluml@aphanet.org,,,"Merck and Co., Inc.Merck & Company","The authors wish to acknowledge Aaron Bonham from the Propel Centre for Population Health Impact at the University of Waterloo for his contributions to statistical analysis; Scientific Technologies Corporation for providing technology and implementation support to the pharmacists; the pharmacist-led care teams in each of the Washington State pharmacy practice sites for their dedication to improving people's health; the Washington State Pharmacy Association for their efforts to advance immunization practice and for providing state-level support in the project.

Forecasting results during 7 August to 1 September 2016 are evaluated for Shanghai and eight provincial cities in Eastern China. The results exhibit large differences in model performance for different regions. The overestimation of NO2 and PM2.5 for the cities within or adjacent to the Yangtze River Delta (YRD) region suggests air quality measures taken in preparation of the 2016 G20 Summit were effective in reducing pollutants concentrations. The results also show that large reductions in HTAP 2010 NOx and SO2 emissions are required, suggesting that regular updates of emission inventories are necessary to capture the rapid changes in pollutant emissions in Eastern China.","[Xie, Ying; Xu, Jianming; Zhou, Guangqiang; Chang, Luyu; Gu, Yixuan] Yangtze River Delta Ctr Environm Meteorol Predict, Shanghai 200030, Peoples R China; [Xie, Ying; Xu, Jianming; Zhou, Guangqiang; Chang, Luyu; Gu, Yixuan] Shanghai Meteorol Serv, Shanghai Key Lab Meteorol & Hlth, Shanghai 200030, Peoples R China; [Chen, Baode] China Meteorol Adm, Shanghai Typhoon Inst, Shanghai, Peoples R China",,"Xie, Y (corresponding author), Yangtze River Delta Ctr Environm Meteorol Predict, Shanghai 200030, Peoples R China.; Xie, Y (corresponding author), Shanghai Meteorol Serv, Shanghai Key Lab Meteorol & Hlth, Shanghai 200030, Peoples R China.",yxie33@outlook.com; metxujm@163.com; zhougq21@163.com; changluyu1989@126.com; guyixuan@mail.iap.ac.cn; baode@mail.typhoon.gov.cn,,,,,,21,0,0,1,3,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"233 SPRING STREET, NEW YORK, NY 10013, UNITED STATES",,,978-3-319-59489-7; 978-3-319-59488-0,ISSI SCI REP SER,,,2017,16,,,,,,405,416,,10.1007/978-3-319-59489-7_19,10.1007/978-3-319-59489-7,,12,Environmental Sciences; Meteorology & Atmospheric Sciences,Book Citation Index – Science (BKCI-S),Environmental Sciences & Ecology; Meteorology & Atmospheric Sciences,BK4PZ,WOS:000437096200020,,,,,2022-02-17

This DA system was applied to simultaneously adjust the chemical initial conditions (ICs) and emission inputs of the species affecting PM10, PM2.5, SO2, NO2, O-3, and CO concentrations during an extreme haze episode that occurred in early October 2014 over East Asia. Numerical experimental results indicate that ICs played key roles in PM2.5, PM10 and CO forecasts during the severe haze episode over the North China Plain. The 72h verification forecasts with the optimized ICs and emissions performed very similarly to the verification forecasts with only optimized ICs and the prescribed emissions. For the first-day forecast, near-perfect verification forecasts results were achieved. However, with longer-range forecasts, the DA impacts decayed quickly. For the SO(2 )verification forecasts, it was efficient to improve the SO2 forecast via the joint adjustment of SO2 ICs and emissions. Large improvements were achieved for SO2 forecasts with both the optimized ICs and emissions for the whole 72 h forecast range. Similar improvements were achieved for SO2 forecasts with optimized ICs only for the first 3 h, and then the impact of the ICs decayed quickly. For the NO2 verification forecasts, both forecasts performed much worse than the control run without DA. Plus, the 72 h O-3 verification forecasts performed worse than the control run during the daytime, due to the worse performance of the NO2 forecasts, even though they performed better at night. However, relatively favorable NO2 and O-3 forecast results were achieved for the Yangtze River delta and Pearl River delta regions.","[Peng, Zhen; Lei, Lili; Su, Jianning; Ding, Aijun; Chu, Kekuan] Nanjing Univ, Sch Atmospher Sci, Nanjing, Jiangsu, Peoples R China; [Lei, Lili; Chu, Kekuan] Nanjing Univ, Key Lab Mesoscale Severe Weather, Minist Educ, Nanjing, Jiangsu, Peoples R China; [Liu, Zhiquan; Ban, Junmei] Natl Ctr Atmospher Res, POB 3000, Boulder, CO 80307 USA; [Su, Jianning; Ding, Aijun] Jiangsu Prov Collaborat Innovat Ctr Climate Chang, Nanjing, Jiangsu, Peoples R China; [Chen, Dan; Kou, Xingxia] CMA, Inst Urban Meteorol, Beijing, Peoples R China",,"Peng, Z (corresponding author), Nanjing Univ, Sch Atmospher Sci, Nanjing, Jiangsu, Peoples R China.; Liu, ZQ (corresponding author), Natl Ctr Atmospher Res, POB 3000, Boulder, CO 80307 USA.",pengzhen@nju.edu.cn; liuz@ucar.edu,"NJU, SAS/F-2585-2015; Ding, Aijun/D-1610-2009; Chen, Dan/R-4486-2016","Ding, Aijun/0000-0003-4481-5386; Chen, Dan/0000-0002-6317-0707","National Key Technologies Research and Development program of ChinaNational Key Technology R&D Program [2016YFC0202102]; National Natural Science Foundation of ChinaNational Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC) [41875014, 41575141, 41675052]; US National Science FoundationNational Science Foundation (NSF)","The authors are grateful to the two anonymous reviewers for their valuable suggestions.

Design/methodology/approach To test the authors' predictions, they identify a sample of 161,673 stock recommendations with contemporaneous earnings forecasts and/or cash flow forecasts and regress market-adjusted stock returns on a binary variable that proxies for the issuance of cash flow forecasts while controlling for contemporaneous earnings forecast accuracy, earnings quality, analysts' forecast experience and capability and certain firm characteristics. The authors' test results are robust to alternative measures of recommendation profitability, earnings quality and the use of recommendation revisions instead of recommendation levels. Findings The authors find that when analysts issue cash flow forecasts concurrently with earnings forecasts, their stock recommendations lead to higher profitability than when they only issue earnings forecasts, after controlling for analysts' forecast capability. Moreover, the authors document that the contemporaneous positive relationship between cash flow forecasts and recommendations profitability is stronger for firms with low earnings quality than for firms with high earnings quality. The findings suggest that cash flow forecasts issued by analysts in response to market demand likely play a more important role in firm valuation than cash flow forecasts issued by analysts mainly because of supply-side considerations. Research limitations/implications - Future research could build on these findings to conduct further investigation on the alternative incentives for analysts' forecasts of sales growth and long-term growth rates. Practical implications - These findings may also help investors to better assess the quality of analysts' research outputs and to identify superior stock recommendations. Originality/value This study provides insight into the role of cash flow forecasts in firm valuation and adds fresh evidence to the debate on the usefulness of cash flow forecasts. It extends the stream of research on the characteristics of analyst forecasts and increases our knowledge about the role of analysts in the financial market.","[Pan, Shanshan; Xu, Zhaohui Randall] Univ Houston Clear Lake, Dept Accounting, Houston, TX 77058 USA",,"Xu, ZR (corresponding author), Univ Houston Clear Lake, Dept Accounting, Houston, TX 77058 USA.",pan@uhcl.edu; xuzhao@uhcl.edu,"Pan, Shanshan/ABA-2725-2020; Pan, Shanshan/V-5925-2017","Pan, Shanshan/0000-0002-9250-1552; ",,,,48,2,2,0,7,EMERALD GROUP PUBLISHING LTD,BINGLEY,"HOWARD HOUSE, WAGON LANE, BINGLEY BD16 1WA, W YORKSHIRE, ENGLAND",1834-7649,1758-9037,,INT J ACCOUNT INF MA,Int.

This hypothesis can be explored using regional coupled prediction systems, in which the known interactions and feedbacks between different physical and bio-geochemical components of the environment across sky, sea and land can be simulated. Such systems are becoming increasingly common research tools. This paper describes the development of the UKC2 regional coupled research system, which has been delivered under the UK Environmental Prediction Prototype project. This provides the first implementation of an atmosphere-land-ocean-wave modelling system focussed on the United Kingdom and surrounding seas at km-scale resolution. The UKC2 coupled system incorporates models of the atmosphere (Met Office Unified Model), land surface with river routing (JULES), shelf-sea ocean (NEMO) and ocean waves (WAVEWATCH III). These components are coupled, via OASIS3-MCT libraries, at unprecedentedly high resolution across the UK within a north-western European regional domain A research framework has been established to explore the representation of feedback processes in coupled and uncoupled modes, providing a new research tool for UK environmental science. This paper documents the technical design and implementation of UKC2, along with the associated evaluation framework. An analysis of new results comparing the output of the coupled UKC2 system with relevant forced control simulations for six contrasting case studies of 5-day duration is presented. Results demonstrate that performance can be achieved with the UKC2 system that is at least comparable to its component control simulations. For some cases, improvements in air temperature, sea surface temperature, wind speed, significant wave height and mean wave period highlight the potential benefits of coupling between environmental model components. Results also illustrate that the coupling itself is not sufficient to address all known model issues. Priorities for future development of the UK Environmental Prediction framework and component systems are discussed.","[Lewis, Huw W.; Sanchez, Juan Manuel Castillo; Graham, Jennifer; Saulter, Andrew; Bornemann, Jorge; Arnold, Alex; Fallmann, Joachim; Harris, Chris; Pearson, David; Ramsdale, Steven; O'Neill, Clare; Rumbold, Heather; O'Dea, Enda; Hines, Adrian; Palmer, Tamzin; Best, Martin; Edwards, John; Siddorn, John] Met Off, Exeter EX1 3PB, Devon, England; [Martinez-de la Torre, Alberto; Blyth, Eleanor; Bell, Victoria A.; Davies, Helen; Marthews, Toby R.] Ctr Ecol & Hydrol, Wallingford OX10 8BB, Oxon, England; [Bricheno, Lucy; Brereton, Ashley; Guihou, Karen; Holt, Jason] Natl Oceanog Ctr, Liverpool L3 5DA, Merseyside, England; [Butenschon, Momme] Plymouth Marine Lab, Plymouth PL1 2LP, Devon, England; [Dadson, Simon J.] Univ Oxford, Sch Geog & Environm, South Parks Rd, Oxford OX1 3QY, England",,"Lewis, HW (corresponding author), Met Off, Exeter EX1 3PB, Devon, England.",huw.lewis@metoffice.gov.uk,"Blyth, Eleanor M/A-4010-2009; Bell, Victoria A/K-1857-2012; Fallmann, Joachim/P-3493-2015; Butenschoen, Momme/AAJ-7615-2021; O'Neill, Clare/A-2936-2012; Marthews, Toby Richard/H-6264-2014; Bricheno, Lucy M/B-2826-2014; Dadson, Simon J/D-2370-2010; Reynard, Nick/I-6509-2012; Fallmann, Joachim/AAE-2470-2021; Best, Martin/AAF-1051-2019; Holt, Jason/B-6323-2012","Blyth, Eleanor M/0000-0002-5052-238X; Bell, Victoria A/0000-0002-0792-5650; Butenschoen, Momme/0000-0002-4592-9927; O'Neill, Clare/0000-0002-8408-6387; Marthews, Toby Richard/0000-0003-3727-6468; Reynard, Nick/0000-0002-5185-3869; Holt, Jason/0000-0002-3298-8477; Fallmann, Joachim/0000-0002-3099-0266; Martinez-de la Torre, Alberto/0000-0003-0244-5348; Guihou, Karen/0000-0002-5645-4920; Graham, Jennifer/0000-0002-1950-5266; Bornemann, Jorge/0000-0003-2537-6883; Best, Martin/0000-0003-4468-876X; Siddorn, John/0000-0003-3848-8868","National Oceanography Centre (NOC); Met Office; Plymouth Marine Laboratory (PML)UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Natural Environment Research Council (NERC); Centre for Ecology & Hydrology (CEH); NERCUK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Natural Environment Research Council (NERC) [NE/I01277X/2, noc010010, ceh020006, ceh020013, pml010010] Funding Source: UKRI; Natural Environment Research CouncilUK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Natural Environment Research Council (NERC) [NE/R015953/1, noc010010, pml010010, ceh010010, ceh020013, ceh020006, NE/I01277X/2, NE/S017380/1] Funding Source: researchfish","This research has been carried out under national capability funding as part of a directed effort on UK Environmental Prediction, in collaboration between the Centre for Ecology & Hydrology (CEH), the Met Office, the National Oceanography Centre (NOC) and Plymouth Marine Laboratory (PML).",,87,30,30,1,10,COPERNICUS GESELLSCHAFT MBH,GOTTINGEN,"BAHNHOFSALLEE 1E, GOTTINGEN, 37081, GERMANY",1991-959X,1991-9603,,GEOSCI MODEL DEV,Geosci.

This research presents the development of a non-linear autoregressive exogenous neural network (NARX) for forecasting sediment concentrations at the exit of Francia Creek watershed (Valparaiso, Chile). Details are presented on input data selection, data splitting, selection of model architecture, determination of model structure, NARX training (optimization of model parameters), and model validation (hindcasting and forecasting). The study explored if the developed artificial neural network model is valid for forecasting daily suspended sediment concentrations for a complete year, capturing seasonal trends, and maximum and baseflow concentrations. Francia Creek watershed covers approximately 3.24 km(2). Land cover within the catchment consists mainly of native and exotic vegetation, eroded soil, and urban areas. Input data consisting of precipitation and stream flow time-series were fed to a NARX network for forecasting daily suspended sediments (SST) concentrations for years 2013-2014, and hindcasting for years 2008-2010. Training of the network was performed with daily SST, precipitation, and flow data from years 2012 and 2013. The resulting NARX net consisted of an open-loop, 12-node hidden layer, 100 iterations, using Bayesian regularization backpropagation. Hindcasting of daily and monthly SST concentrations for years 2008 through 2010 was successful. Daily SST concentrations for years 2013 and 2014 were forecasted successfully for baseflow conditions (R-2 = 0.73, NS = 0.71, and Kling-Gupta efficiency index (K-G) = 0.84). Forecasting daily SST concentrations for year 2014 was within acceptable statistical fit and error margins (R-2 = 0.53, NS = 0.47, K-G = 0.60, d = 0.82). Forecasting of monthly maximum SST concentrations for the two-year period (2013 and 2014) was also successful (R-2 = 0.69, NS = 0.60, K-G = 0.54, d = 0.84).","[Alarcon, Vladimir J.] Univ Diego Portales, Dept Civil Engn, Santiago 8370191, Chile",,"Alarcon, VJ (corresponding author), Univ Diego Portales, Dept Civil Engn, Santiago 8370191, Chile.",Vladimir.alarcon@udp.cl,"Alarcon, Vladimir J/P-9202-2016","Alarcon, Vladimir J/0000-0001-6629-5639",,,,38,1,1,1,1,MDPI,BASEL,"ST ALBAN-ANLAGE 66, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND",,2071-1050,,SUSTAINABILITY-BASEL,Sustainability,JAN,2021,13,1,,,,,,,363,10.3390/su13010363,,,18,Green & Sustainable Science & Technology; Environmental Sciences; Environmental Studies,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Science & Technology - Other Topics; Environmental Sciences & Ecology,PQ3OE,WOS:000606455800001,,gold,,,2022-02-17

The forecast model, which was expanded by combining the Weather Research and Forecasting with Chemistry (WRF-Chem) model and a forecast model of emission scaling factors, generated both chemical concentration fields and emission scaling factors. The forecast model of emission scaling factors was developed by using the ensemble concentration ratios of the WRF-Chem forecast chemical concentrations and also the time smoothing operator. Hourly surface fine particulate matter (PM2.5) observations were assimilated in this system over China from 5 to 16 October 2014. A series of 48 h forecasts was then carried out with the optimized initial conditions and emissions on each day at 00:00UTC and a control experiment was performed without data assimilation. In addition, we also performed an experiment of pure assimilation chemical ICs and the corresponding 48 h forecasts experiment for comparison. The results showed that the forecasts with the optimized initial conditions and emissions typically outperformed those from the control experiment. In the Yangtze River delta (YRD) and the Pearl River delta (PRD) regions, large reduction of the root-mean-square errors (RMSEs) was obtained for almost the entire 48 h forecast range attributed to assimilation. In particular, the relative reduction in RMSE due to assimilation was about 37.5% at nighttime when WRF-Chem performed comparatively worse. In the Beijing-Tianjin-Hebei (JJJ) region, relatively smaller improvements were achieved in the first 24 h forecast but then no improvements were achieved afterwards. Comparing to the forecasts with only the optimized ICs, the forecasts with the joint adjustment were always much better during the night in the PRD and YRD regions. However, they were very similar during daytime in both regions. Also, they performed similarly for almost the entire 48 h forecast range in the JJJ region.","[Peng, Zhen] Nanjing Univ, Sch Atmospher Sci, Nanjing, Jiangsu, Peoples R China; [Peng, Zhen; Liu, Zhiquan; Chen, Dan; Ban, Junmei] Natl Ctr Atmospher Res, POB 3000, Boulder, CO 80307 USA; [Chen, Dan] CMA, Inst Urban Meteorol, Beijing, Peoples R China",,"Peng, Z (corresponding author), Nanjing Univ, Sch Atmospher Sci, Nanjing, Jiangsu, Peoples R China.; Peng, Z; Liu, ZQ (corresponding author), Natl Ctr Atmospher Res, POB 3000, Boulder, CO 80307 USA.",pengzhen@nju.edu.cn; liuz@ucar.edu,"Chen, Dan/R-4486-2016","Chen, Dan/0000-0002-6317-0707",National Key Technologies Research and Development program of ChinaNational Key Technology R&D Program [2016YFC0202102]; Strategic Priority Research Program - Climate Change: Carbon Budget and Relevant IssuesChinese Academy of Sciences [XDA05040404]; National Natural Science Foundation of ChinaNational Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC) [41575141]; US National Science FoundationNational Science Foundation (NSF),"We thank three anonymous reviews for their helpful comments.

To assess the impacts of all-sky (i.e. clear, cloudy and precipitating) assimilation of MWHS-2 183 GHz channels on the analysis and forecasts of typhoon precipitation caused by Typhoon Nida which made landfall in Guangdong Province, China in 2016, three experiments (without MWHS-2 data, with MWHS-2 data in clear-sky conditions and with MWHS-2 data in all-sky conditions) have been carried out. RTTOV-SCATT, a fast Radiative Transfer Model for simulating cloud-and precipitation-affected microwave radiances, and a symmetric observation error model for all-sky radiance assimilation are implemented within the Weather Research and Forecasting model data assimilation system (WRFDA) and its three-dimension variational data assimilation scheme is used for all experiments. Compared with the experiment run without MWHS-2 data, the assimilation of MWHS-2 observations in clear-sky and all-sky conditions makes more accurate precipitation forecasts over the north-central Guangdong. Furthermore, compared with the clear-sky experiment, the precipitation distribution over the east of the Pearl River and the rainfall amount in the eastern Guangdong both are more close to the observations due to the improved temperature and humidity analysis by assimilating more cloud-and precipitation-affected radiances over the northern South China Sea and Typhoon Nida in all-sky experiment. Since the results in this study are very encouraging, more experiments are to be run to verify the positive impacts of all-sky assimilation on the prediction of severe weather processes. *tastelifeweather@sina.cn","[Xian, Zhipeng; Chen, Keyi] Chengdu Univ Informat Technol, Sch Atmospher Sci, 24 Block 1,Xuefu Rd, Chengdu, Sichuan, Peoples R China; [Xian, Zhipeng; Zhu, Jiang] Chinese Acad Sci, Inst Atmospher Phys, 40 Hua Yan Li, Beijing, Peoples R China",,"Xian, ZP (corresponding author), Chengdu Univ Informat Technol, Sch Atmospher Sci, 24 Block 1,Xuefu Rd, Chengdu, Sichuan, Peoples R China.; Xian, ZP (corresponding author), Chinese Acad Sci, Inst Atmospher Phys, 40 Hua Yan Li, Beijing, Peoples R China.",,,,National Natural Science Funds of ChinaNational Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC) [41505014],The National Natural Science Funds of China supported this research through Grant No. 41505014.,,21,0,0,2,2,SPIE-INT SOC OPTICAL ENGINEERING,BELLINGHAM,"1000 20TH ST, PO BOX 10, BELLINGHAM, WA 98227-0010 USA",0277-786X,1996-756X,978-1-5106-2136-7,PROC SPIE,,,2018,10780,,,,,,,,UNSP 1078019,10.1117/12.2324457,,,7,Remote Sensing; Optics,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S),Remote Sensing; Optics,BL6OU,WOS:000454578000023,,,,,2022-02-17

In China, to address severe air pollution in the Yangtze River Delta region, the local government has formulated Five-Year Plans to set the road map for air pollution control by phased targets in 2020, but the effectiveness of these policies is still uncertain. There is therefore a need for accurate prediction of control strategies. Here we present a computational evaluation of the predicted effectiveness of four emission control strategies: normal or enhanced emission reduction for industry and power plants, and normal or enhanced emission reduction for industry, power plants and transportation, designed on the basis of policies of the 13th Five-Year Plans. Effectiveness was tested on concentrations of PM2.5, e.g., particulate matter with aerodynamic diameter less than 2.5 mu m, using the two-way coupled Weather Research and Forecasting-Community Multiscale Air Quality (WRF-CMAQ) model. Results show that by implementing the four emission control strategies, only Hangzhou with the strictest emission controls in four main cities (Hangzhou, Hefei, Nanjing and Shanghai) can meet the 20% reduction goals of PM2.5 concentrations in the 13th Five-Year Plan, indicating that current policies are not sufficient to control the severe air pollution in the Yangtze River Delta region. Sensitivity tests show that residential emissions have the highest contributions to the PM2.5 concentrations in January in the four main cities of Hangzhou, Hefei, Nanjing and Shanghai, followed by agriculture, industry, transportation and power plants. Predicted annual mean reduction percentages for PM2.5 are the highest in Hangzhou, from - 9.7 to - 20.1%, followed by Nanjing, from - 8.2 to - 18.7%, Shanghai, from - 7.4 to - 15.8%, and Hefei, from - 6.1 to - 13.8%. This finding highlights the predominance of residential emissions, which should be better controlled, notably coal burning. By comparison, predicted annual contributions of regional transport and natural sources to mean PM2.5 concentrations in four cities range from 29.2 to 36.6%. Overall, a major finding is that residential sources are of comparable importance to industrial, power plant and transportation sources to PM2.5 concentrations, especially for winter. This information will help governments of other regions of China, as well as other developing countries, to formulate more appropriate emission control strategies where coal is used for heating and cooking purposes in the developing countries.","[Wu, Yujie; Wang, Peng; Yu, Shaocai; Wang, Liqiang; Li, Pengfei; Li, Zhen; Mehmood, Khalid] Zhejiang Univ, Coll Environm & Resource Sci, Res Ctr Air Pollut & Hlth, Hangzhou 310058, Zhejiang, Peoples R China; [Wu, Yujie; Wang, Peng; Yu, Shaocai; Wang, Liqiang; Li, Pengfei; Li, Zhen; Mehmood, Khalid; Liu, Weiping] Zhejiang Univ, Coll Environm & Resource Sci, Minist Educ, Key Lab Environm Remediat & Ecol Hlth, Hangzhou 310058, Zhejiang, Peoples R China; [Yu, Shaocai; Seinfeld, John H.] CALTECH, Div Chem & Chem Engn, Pasadena, CA 91125 USA; [Wu, Jian] Inst Zhejiang Prov, Inst Environm Sci Res & Design, Hangzhou 310007, Zhejiang, Peoples R China; [Lichtfouse, Eric] Aix Marseille Univ, CNRS, Coll France, CEREGE,INRA,IRD,Europole Mediterraneen Arbois, Ave Louis Philibert, F-13545 Aix En Provence, France; [Rosenfeld, Daniel] Hebrew Univ Jerusalem, Inst Earth Sci, Jerusalem, Israel",,"Yu, SC (corresponding author), Zhejiang Univ, Coll Environm & Resource Sci, Res Ctr Air Pollut & Hlth, Hangzhou 310058, Zhejiang, Peoples R China.; Yu, SC (corresponding author), Zhejiang Univ, Coll Environm & Resource Sci, Minist Educ, Key Lab Environm Remediat & Ecol Hlth, Hangzhou 310058, Zhejiang, Peoples R China.; Yu, SC (corresponding author), CALTECH, Div Chem & Chem Engn, Pasadena, CA 91125 USA.",shaocaiyu@zju.edu.cn,"Mehmood, Khalid/ABE-9052-2020; Liu, Weiping/E-9208-2010; Mehmood, Khalid/AAP-9922-2021; Rosenfeld, Daniel/AAJ-4617-2021; Rosenfeld, Daniel/F-6077-2016; Lichtfouse, Eric/F-4759-2011","Mehmood, Khalid/0000-0002-5006-1042; Liu, Weiping/0000-0002-1173-892X; Rosenfeld, Daniel/0000-0002-0784-7656; Rosenfeld, Daniel/0000-0002-0784-7656; Lichtfouse, Eric/0000-0002-8535-8073","Department of Science and Technology of China [2016YFC0202702, 2014BAC22B06]; National Natural Science Foundation of ChinaNational Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC) [21577126]; Joint NSFC-ISF Research Program [41561144004]; National Natural Science Foundation of ChinaNational Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC); Israel Science FoundationIsrael Science Foundation; Zhejiang 1000 Talent Plan; Research Center for Air Pollution and Health in Zhejiang University","This work was partially supported by the Department of Science and Technology of China (No. 2016YFC0202702; No. 2014BAC22B06) and National Natural Science Foundation of China (No. 21577126).

Incidental catches of alewife Rosa pseudoharengus) and blueback herring (A. aestivalis) in the commercial Atlantic herring (Clupea harengus) fishery have received substantial attention on the Northeast U.S. continental shelf, despite an existing bycatch avoidance program. This study evaluates the utility of existing species distribution forecasts to predict river herring catches in the southern New England small mesh bottom trawl Atlantic herring fishery, with the ultimate goal of incorporating incidental catch forecasts into the bycatch avoidance program. Commercial Atlantic herring bottom trawl vessels assisted with field-based evaluation of alewife, blueback herring, and Atlantic herring species distribution forecast models. Vessels were equipped with conductivity, temperature, and depth probes, and sampling occurred throughout the fishery season (January-March). Locations of expected low and high forecasted incidental catches were sampled, as well as locations the captain expected to find low and high incidental catches. This allowed us to sample within the spatial area the fishery occurs, and to evaluate the forecasted conditions, and predictions, at the spatial scale of the fishery. Catch differences between high and low probability stations were small and variable, as were differences in modeled probability of species presence. No differences were observed between observations at model-predicted stations and captain-selected stations. The sampling provided a better understanding of the potential effectiveness of distribution forecasts for further reducing incidental catches. Existing models have limited use at the spatial scale of this fishery, but could be improved by developing models with fishery-dependent data. Collaborations between researchers, managers, and the Atlantic herring commercial fleet have improved relationships between the groups, and continued collaboration in the development and evaluation of incidental catch reduction tools is key for further reducing incidental catches.","[Turner, Sara M.] Massachusetts Div Marine Fisheries, New Bedford, MA 02744 USA; [Hare, Jonathan A.] NOAA, Northeast Fisheries Sci Ctr, Woods Hole, MA USA; [Manderson, John P.] NOAA, Sandy Hook Lab, Northeast Fisheries Sci Ctr, Highlands, NJ USA; [Hoey, John J.; Richardson, David E.; Sarro, Christopher L.] NOAA, Narragansett Lab, Northeast Fisheries Sci Ctr, Narragansett, RI USA; [Silva, Ryan] NOAA, Greater Atlantic Reg Fisheries Off, Gloucester, MA USA",,"Turner, SM (corresponding author), Massachusetts Div Marine Fisheries, New Bedford, MA 02744 USA.",Sara.Turner@state.ma.us,,,NOAA Greater Atlantic Regional Fisheries Office,"This work was funded by the NOAA Greater Atlantic Regional Fisheries Office.

A better understanding of the precipitation variations in the late spring and its predictability not only greatly increase our knowledge of related mechanisms, but it also benefits society and the economy. Four models participating in the North American Multi-Model Ensemble (NMME) were selected to study their abilities to forecast the late spring rainfall over southeastern China and the major sources of heavy rainfall from the perspective of the sea surface temperature (SST) field. We found that the models have better abilities to forecast the heavy rainfall over the middle and lower reaches of the Yangtze River region (MLYZR) with only a 1-month lead time, but they failed for a 3-month lead time since the occurrence of the heavy rainfall was inconsistent with the observations. The observations indicate that the warm SST anomalies in the tropical eastern Indian Ocean are vital to the simultaneously heavy rainfall in the MLYZR in May, but an El Nino event is not a necessary condition for determining the heavy rainfall over the MLYZR. The heavy rainfall over the MLYZR in May is always accompanied by warming of the northeastern Indian Ocean and of the northeastern South China Sea (NSCS) from April to May in the models and observations, respectively. In the models, El Nino events may promote the warming processes over the northeastern Indian Ocean, which leads to heavy rainfall in the MLYZR. However, in the real world, El Nino events are not the main reason for the warming of the NSCS, and further research on the causes of this warming is still needed.","[Zhang, Shouwen; Jiang, Hua] Natl Marine Environm Forecasting Ctr, Dahuisi Rd 8, Beijing 100081, Peoples R China; [Wang, Hui] Natl Marine Environm Forecasting Ctr, Key Lab Res Marine Hazards Forecasting, Beijing, Peoples R China; [Wang, Hui] Shandong Univ, Inst Marine Sci & Technol, Qingdao, Shandong, Peoples R China; [Jiang, Hua] Southern Marine Sci & Engn Guangdong Lab Zhuhai, Zhuhai, Peoples R China; [Ma, Wentao] Chinese Acad Sci, Aerosp Informat Res Inst, State Key Lab Remote Sensing Sci, Beijing 100101, Peoples R China",,"Jiang, H (corresponding author), Natl Marine Environm Forecasting Ctr, Dahuisi Rd 8, Beijing 100081, Peoples R China.",hjiang@nmefc.cn,,,"National Key R&D Program of China [2017YFA0604203, 2020YFA0608804, 2019YFA0606703, 2016YFB0500204]","This research was supported by the National Key R&D Program of China (Grant nos. 2017YFA0604203, 2020YFA0608804, 2019YFA0606703 and 2016YFB0500204).

Based on the complex event processing and event context, this method divides historical data through context clustering and supports cluster update through online clustering of event streams. For different clustered data, a search-scoring method is used to learn the corresponding Bayesian network structure, and a Bayesian network is approximated based on a Gaussian mixture model.

In the Advanced Microwave Sounding Unit-A (AMSU-A) data stream, brightness temperatures in 15 channels are available primarily for profiling atmospheric temperature from the Earth's surface to the low stratosphere. In the Advanced Microwave Sounding Unit-B (AMSU-B) or Microwave Humidity Sounder (MHS) data stream, the brightness temperatures in five channels are included for sounding water vapour in the low troposphere. Assimilation of microwave radiance data in numerical weather prediction systems has also been carried out with AMSU-A and AMSU-B (MHS) data in two separate data streams. A new approach is to combine AMSU-A and MHS radiances into one data stream for their assimilation. The National Centers for Environmental Prediction Gridpoint Statistical Interpolation analysis system and the Advanced Research Weather Research and Forecast model are employed for testing the impacts of the combined datasets. It is shown that the spatial collocation between MHS and AMSU-A fields of view in the one data stream experiment allows for an improved quality control of MHS data, especially over the conditions where the liquid-phase clouds are dominant. As a result, a closer fit of analyses to AMSU-A and MHS observations is obtained, especially for AMSU-A surface-sensitive channels.

Through multivariate time series forecasting experiments for ozone concentration, we show that the proposed model is easier and performs better than the weather research and forecasting model with chemistry based forecasting system. Furthermore, we show that the predicted ozone concentration can be matched with the ground truth value under single-timestep and multi-timestep forward forecasting conditions. The experiment results show that the seq2seq model is capable of reliably predicting ozone concentration with a high level of accuracy.

Recently, deep learning approach, as a data-driven alternative to traffic flow model-based data assimilation and prediction methods, has become popular in this domain. Many of these deep learning models show promising predictive performance, but inherently suffer from a lack of interpretability. This difficulty largely originates from the inconsistency between the static input-output mappings encoded in deep neural networks and the dynamic nature of traffic phenomena. Under different traffic conditions, such as freely-flowing versus heavily congested traffic, different mappings are needed to predict the propagation of congestion and the resulting speeds over the network more accurately. In this study, we design a novel variant of the graph attention mechanism. The major innovation of this so-called dynamic graph convolution (DGC) module is that local area-wide graph convolutional kernels are dynamically generated from evolving traffic states to capture real-time spatial dependencies. When traffic conditions change, the spatial correlation encoded by DGC module changes as well. Using the DGC, we propose a multistep traffic forecasting model, the Dynamic Graph Convolutional Network (DGCN). Experiments using real freeway data show that the DGCN has a competitive predictive performance compared to other state-of-the-art models. Equally importantly, the prediction process in the DGCN and the trained parameters are indeed explainable. It turns out that the DGCN learns to mimic the upstream-downstream asymmetric information flow of typical road traffic operations. Specifically, there exists a speed-dependent optimal receptive field - which governs what information the DGC kernels assimilate - that is consistent with the back-propagation speed of stop-and-go waves in traffic streams. This implies that the learnt parameters are consistent with traffic flow theory. We believe that this research paves a path to more transparent deep learning models applied for short-term traffic forecasting.","[Li, Guopeng; Knoop, Victor L.; van Lint, Hans] Delft Univ Technol, Stevinweg 1, NL-2628 CN Delft, Netherlands",,"Li, GP (corresponding author), Delft Univ Technol, Stevinweg 1, NL-2628 CN Delft, Netherlands.",G.Li-5@tudelft.nl; V.L.Knoop@tudelft.nl; J.W.C.vanLint@tudelft.nl,,,NWO/TTW project MiRRORS [16270],This research is sponsored by by the NWO/TTW project MiRRORS with grant agreement number 16270.

However, there remain contradictory results in terms of character and timing of Northern Hemisphere large-scale circulation features to Arctic sea ice changes. This study assesses the impact of realistic late autumn eastern Arctic sea ice anomalies on atmospheric wintertime circulation at mid-latitudes, pointing to a hidden potential for seasonal predictability. Using a dynamical seasonal prediction system, an ensemble of seasonal forecast simulations of 23 historical winter seasons is run with reduced November sea ice cover in the Barents-Kara Seas, and is compared to the respective control seasonal hindcast simulations set. A non energy-conserving approach is adopted for achieving the desired sea ice loss, with artificial heat being added conditionally to the ocean surface heat fluxes so as to inhibit the formation of sea ice during November. Our results point to a robust atmospheric circulation response in the North Pacific sector, similar to previous findings on the multidecadal timescale. Specifically, an anticyclonic anomaly at upper and lower levels is identified over the eastern midlatitude North Pacific, leading to dry conditions over the North American southwest coast. The responses are related to a re-organization (weakening) of west-Pacific tropical convection and interactions with the tropical Hadley circulation. A possible interaction of the poleward-shifted Pacific eddy-driven jet stream and the Hadley cell is discussed . The winter circulation response in the Euro-Atlantic sector is ephemeral in character and statistically significant in January only, corroborating previous findings of an intermittent and non-stationary Arctic sea ice-NAO link during boreal winter. These results aid our understanding of the seasonal impacts of reduced eastern Arctic sea ice on the midlatitude atmospheric circulation with implications for seasonal predictability in wintertime.","[Seidenglanz, Anne; Athanasiadis, Panos; Ruggieri, Paolo; Gualdi, Silvio] Ctr Euro Mediterraneo Cambiamenti Climat CMCC, Bologna, Italy; [Ruggieri, Paolo] Univ Bologna, Dipartimento Fis & Astron, Bologna, Italy; [Cvijanovic, Ivana] Ctr Nacl Supercomputat BSC CNS, Barcelona Supercomp Ctr, Barcelona, Spain; [Li, Camille] Univ Bergen, Geophys Inst, Bergen, Norway; [Li, Camille] Bjerknes Ctr Climate Res, Bergen, Norway; [Gualdi, Silvio] Ist Nazl Geofis & Vulcanol INGV, Bologna, Italy",,"Seidenglanz, A (corresponding author), Ctr Euro Mediterraneo Cambiamenti Climat CMCC, Bologna, Italy.",annework985@gmail.com,"Gualdi, Silvio/F-3061-2015; Ruggieri, Paolo/X-6334-2018","Gualdi, Silvio/0000-0001-7777-8935; Ruggieri, Paolo/0000-0003-1996-7206",Blue-Action project (European Union's Horizon 2020 research and innovation programme) [727852],"This study was supported by the Blue-Action project (European Union's Horizon 2020 research and innovation programme, Grant 727852.",,56,0,0,4,4,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"ONE NEW YORK PLAZA, SUITE 4600, NEW YORK, NY, UNITED STATES",0930-7575,1432-0894,,CLIM DYNAM,Clim.

Prior research on corporate cash policy suggests that investors value cash holdings more when information asymmetry is low (e.g., Drobetz, Gruninger, & Hirschvogl, 2010). Given both streams of literature, we examine whether investors value cash and cash flows higher for firms that commit to providing management earnings forecasts, an important form of voluntary disclosure. In univariate analyses, we show that committed forecasting is negatively associated with widely accepted measures of information asymmetry. In multivariate tests, we document that committed forecasting is associated with a higher market value of cash, surplus cash and operating cash flows. Our multivariate results are robust to adjustments for endogeneity in managers' forecast decision, and to the inclusion of controls for alternative uses of cash, firm information quality, information demand and governance.","[Imhof, Michael J.] Wichita State Univ, Wichita, KS 67260 USA; [Seavey, Scott E.] Florida Atlantic Univ, Boca Raton, FL 33431 USA",,"Imhof, MJ (corresponding author), Sch Accountancy, 337 Clinton Hall,1845 Fairmount St, Wichita, KS 67260 USA.",michael.imhof@wichita.edu,,,,,,93,2,2,0,4,ELSEVIER SCIENCE BV,AMSTERDAM,"PO BOX 211, 1000 AE AMSTERDAM, NETHERLANDS",0882-6110,1046-5715,,ADV ACCOUNT,Adv.

The coupled GSI-WRF-Chem system is applied to reproduce aerosol levels over China during an extremely polluted winter month, January 2013. After assimilating surface PM2.5 concentrations, the correlation coefficients between observations and model results averaged over the assimilated sites are improved from 0.67 to 0.94. At nonassimilated sites, improvements (higher correlation coefficients and lower mean bias errors (MBE) and root-mean square errors (RMSE)) are also found in PM2.5, PM10, and AOD predictions. Using the constrained aerosol fields, we estimate that the PM2.5 concentrations in January 2013 might have caused 7550 premature deaths in Jing-Jin-Ji areas, which are 2% higher than the estimates using unconstrained aerosol fields. We also estimate that the daytime monthly mean anthropogenic aerosol radiative forcing (ARF) to be -29.9W/m(2) at the surface, 27.0W/m(2) inside the atmosphere, and -2.9W/m(2) at the top of the atmosphere.

At present, most of the air pollutants prediction methods cannot forecast the PM2.5 concentration efficiently in real time when facing large-scale data, and few models can simultaneously consider the influences of high and surface meteorological factors on PM2.5 concentration. In the view of the above two problems, an improved online prediction model for PM2.5 concentration called Weather Research and Forecasting model based quantized kernel adaptive filter (WRF-QKAF) is proposed in this paper. The WRF-QKAF model can accurately predict PM2.5 concentration by combining WRF model and QKAF algorithm. In addition to the air pollutant factors and meteorological factors near ground, the stereoscopic meteorological factors generated by the WRF model are also utilized in the WRF-QKAF model. By this way, the WRF-QKAF model can fully consider the different meteorological conditions and atmospheric factors, and can simulate the physical and chemical transmission process of PM2.5 better. Furthermore, the new model can reduce the complexity of modeling and track the time-varying characteristics of meteorological data, which enables high accuracy online prediction of PM2.5 concentration. Guangzhou, which located in the Pearl River Delta and has serious air pollution problem, is selected as the research area, and the online prediction and analysis of the PM2.5 concentration in 2016 is presented in this paper. Experiments show that the proposed model can characterize the change of PM2.5 concentration well, thus increasing the practicability and real-time performance of the model, and achieving better prediction results than the comparison algorithms.","[Xu, Xinghan; Yoneda, Minoru] Kyoto Univ, Grad Sch Engn, Dept Environm Engn, Kyoto, Japan",,"Xu, XH (corresponding author), Kyoto Univ, Grad Sch Engn, Dept Environm Engn, Kyoto, Japan.",Xu.xinghan.57u@st.kyoto-u.ac.jp,,,,,,22,0,0,1,1,IEEE,NEW YORK,"345 E 47TH ST, NEW YORK, NY 10017 USA",,,978-1-7281-2485-8,,,,2019,,,,,,,994,1001,,,,,8,"Computer Science, Artificial Intelligence",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S),Computer Science,BP5GE,WOS:000555467201012,,,,,2022-02-17

Three experiments were conducted, including a CONTROL without the AOD assimilation, and GOCIDA and VIIRSDA with the assimilation of AOD retrievals from GOCI and VIIRS, respectively. By utilizing the Weather Research and Forecasting with Chemistry (WRF/Chem) model, 48h forecasts were initialized at each 06 UTC from 19 November to 06 December 2013. These forecasts were evaluated with 248 ground-based measurements from the air quality monitoring network across 67 China cities. The results show that overall the CONTROL underestimated surface PM2.5 concentrations, especially over Jing-Jin-Ji (JJJ) region and Yangtze River Delta (YRD) region. Both the GOCIDA and VIIRSDA produced higher surface PM2.5 concentrations mainly over Eastern China, which fits well with the PM2.5 measurements at these eastern sites, with more than 8% error reductions (ER). Moreover, compared to CONTROL, GOCIDA reduced 14.0% and 6.4% error on JJJ region and YRD region, respectively, while VIIRSDA reduced respectively 2.0% and 13.4% error over the corresponding areas. During the heavy polluted period, VIIRSDA improved all sites within YRD region, and GOCIDA enhanced 84% sites. Meanwhile, GOCIDA improved 84% sites on JJJ region, while VIIRSDA did not affect that region. These geographic distinctions might result from spatial dissimilarity between GOCI AOD and VIIRS AOD at time intervals. Moreover, the larger increment produced by AOD DA under stable meteorological conditions could lead to a longer duration (e.g., 1-2 days, > 2 days) of AOD DA impacts. Even though with AOD DA, surface PM2.5 concentrations were still underestimated clearly over heavy polluted periods. And 3% sites performed worse, where low PM2.5 values were observed and CONTROL performed well. With this study, the results indicate that AOD DA can partially improve the accuracy of PM2.5 forecastS. And the obvious geographic differences on forecasts emphasize the potential and importance of combining AOD retrievals from GOO and VIIRS into data assimilation.","[Pang, Jiongming] Sun Yat Sen Univ, Sch Environm Sci & Engn, Guangzhou, Guangdong, Peoples R China; [Liu, Zhiquan; Bresch, Jamie; Ban, Junmei; Cnen, Dan] Natl Ctr Atmospher Res, POB 3000, Boulder, CO 80307 USA; [Wang, Xuemei] Jinan Univ, Inst Environm & Climate Res, Guangzhou, Guangdong, Peoples R China; [Kim, Jhoon] Yonsei Univ, Dept Atmospher Sci, Seoul, South Korea; [Cnen, Dan] China Meteorol Adm, Inst Urban Meteorol, Beijing, Peoples R China",,"Wang, XM (corresponding author), Jinan Univ, Inst Environm & Climate Res, Guangzhou, Guangdong, Peoples R China.",eciwxm@jnu.edu.cn,"Chen, Dan/R-4486-2016; Kim, Jhoon/F-6635-2013","Chen, Dan/0000-0002-6317-0707; Kim, Jhoon/0000-0002-1508-9218","National Natural Science Funds of ChinaNational Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC) [41425020, 91644215]; Science and Technology Planning Project of Guangdong Province, China [2016B050502005]; National Science & Technology Pillar Program [2014BAC21B02]; US National Science FoundationNational Science Foundation (NSF); Development of the integrated data processing system for GOCI-II - Ministry of Ocean and Fisheries, Korea","This work was partially supported by National Natural Science Funds of China (41425020, 91644215), Science and Technology Planning Project of Guangdong Province, China (2016B050502005), and National Science & Technology Pillar Program (2014BAC21B02).

These global wave-like patterns occur due to the variation in Coriolis forces with latitude. In the past several years observational evidence has indicated that there are also Rossby waves in the Sun. Although Rossby waves have been detected in the Sun's photosphere and corona, they most likely originate in the solar tachocline, the sharp shear layer at the base of the solar convection zone, where the differential rotation driven by convection transitions to the solidly rotating radiative interior. These waves differ from their Earth's counterparts by being strongly modified by toroidal magnetic fields in the solar tachocline. Recent simulations of magnetohydrodynamics of tachocline Rossby waves and magnetic fields are demonstrated to produce strong tachocline nonlinear oscillations, which have periods similar to those observed in the solar atmosphere-enhanced periods of solar activity, or seasons-occurring at intervals between six months and two years. These seasonal/subseasonal bursts produce the strongest eruptive space weather events. Thus, a key to forecasting the timing, amplitude, and location of future activity bursts, and hence space weather events, could lie in our ability to forecast the phase and amplitude of Rossby waves and associated tachocline nonlinear oscillations. Accurately forecasting the properties of solar Rossby waves and their impact on space weather will require linking surface activity observations to the magnetohydrodynamics of tachocline Rossby waves, using modern data assimilation techniques. Both short-term (hours to days) and long-term (decadal to millennial) forecasts of space weather and climate are now being made. We highlight in this article the potential of solar Rossby waves for forecasting space weather on intermediate time scales, of several weeks to months up to a few years ahead. Plain Language Summary Forecasting our weather was built on the recognition that global Rossby waves are largely responsible for the jet streams, winter storms, and cold outbreaks that we experience in midlatitudes. Over the past 75 years, there have been enormous improvements in our ability to forecast significant weather events a week or more in advance. These forecasts use complex computational models and massive observational data by means of data assimilation. It now appears that the Sun's global magnetic fields and flows are also influenced by global-scale waves, and so we explore here if a similar methodology can be developed to forecast the resulting space weather that significantly impact our technology-dependent society. In the solar case magnetically modified waves interact with differential rotation to trigger quasi-periodic bursts of magnetic activity. These bursts give rise to space weather events-solar flares and coronal mass ejections-that extend out into the heliosphere and impact our atmosphere. We explore the possibility of forecasting the next bursty period up to one to two years ahead, by connecting surface magnetic observations with Rossby waves deep below, using data assimilation. Our future outlook presented here provides space-weather forecasting on intermediate time scale (few-weeks-to-few-years), filling-in the gap between existing very short and long time scale forecasts.","[Dikpati, Mausumi; McIntosh, Scott W.] Natl Ctr Atmospher Res, High Altitude Observ, Pob 3000, Boulder, CO 80307 USA",,"Dikpati, M (corresponding author), Natl Ctr Atmospher Res, High Altitude Observ, Pob 3000, Boulder, CO 80307 USA.",dikpati@ucar.edu,,"McIntosh, Scott/0000-0002-7369-1776; Dikpati, Mausumi/0000-0002-2227-0488","National Center for Atmospheric Research - National Science Foundation [1852977]; NASANational Aeronautics & Space Administration (NASA) [80NSSC18K1206, 80NSSC20K0355]","We thank Ricky Egeland and Peter Gilman for internally reviewing this manuscript, and for their helpful discussions.

Yet prediction of tornadoes, especially at extended lead periods of more than a few days, remains an arduous task, partly due to the space and time scales involved. Recent research has shown that tropical convection, sea surface temperatures, and the Earth-relative atmospheric angular momentum can induce jet stream configurations that may increase or decrease the probability of tornado frequency across the United States. Applying this recent theoretical work in practice, on 1 March 2015, the authors began the Extended-Range Tornado Activity Forecast (ERTAF) project, with the following goals: 1) to have a map room-style discussion of the anticipated atmospheric state in the 2-3-week lead window; 2) to predict categorical level of tornado activity in that lead window; and 3) to learn from the forecasts through experience by identifying strengths and weaknesses in the methods, as well as identifying any potential scientific knowledge gaps. Over the last five years, the authors have shown skill in predicting U.S. tornado activity two to three weeks in advance during boreal spring. Unsurprisingly, skill is shown to be greater for forecasts spanning week 2 versus week 3. This manuscript documents these forecasting efforts, provides verification statistics, and shares the challenges and lessons learned from predicting tornado activity on the subseasonal time scale.","[Gensini, Vittorio A.] Northern Illinois Univ, Dept Geog & Atmospher Sci, De Kalb, IL 60115 USA; [Barrett, Bradford S.] US Naval Acad, Oceanog Dept, Annapolis, MD 21402 USA; [Allen, John T.] Cent Michigan Univ, Dept Earth & Atmospher Sci, Mt Pleasant, MI 48859 USA; [Gold, David] IBM Corp, Global Business Serv, Weather Analyt Ctr Competency, Armonk, NY USA; [Sirvatka, Paul] Coll DuPage, Meteorol Program, Glen Ellyn, IL USA",,"Gensini, VA (corresponding author), Northern Illinois Univ, Dept Geog & Atmospher Sci, De Kalb, IL 60115 USA.",vgensini@niu.edu,"Allen, John T/A-4483-2012","Allen, John T/0000-0002-2036-0666",,,,42,3,3,0,0,AMER METEOROLOGICAL SOC,BOSTON,"45 BEACON ST, BOSTON, MA 02108-3693 USA",0003-0007,1520-0477,,B AM METEOROL SOC,Bull.

The recent adoption of smart meter infrastructures provided new granular data streams, largely unavailable just ten years ago, that can be utilized to better forecast building-level demand. This paper uses Bayesian Structural Time Series for probabilistic load forecasting at the residential building level to capture uncertainties in forecasting. We use sub-hourly electrical submeter data from 120 residential apartments in Singapore that were part of a behavioral intervention study. The proposed model addresses several fundamental limitations through its flexibility to handle univariate and multivariate scenarios, perform feature selection, and include either static or dynamic effects, as well as its inherent applicability for measurement and verification. We highlight the benefits of this process in three main application areas: (1) Probabilistic Load Forecasting for Apartment-Level Hourly Loads; (2) Submeter Load Forecasting and Segmentation; (3) Measurement and Verification for Behavioral Demand Response. Results show the model achieves a similar performance to ARIMA, another popular time series model, when predicting individual apartment loads, and superior performance when predicting aggregate loads. Furthermore, we show that the model robustly captures uncertainties in the forecasts while providing interpretable results, indicating the importance of, for example, temperature data in its predictions. Finally, our estimates for a behavioral demand response program indicate that it achieved energy savings; however, the confidence interval provided by the probabilistic model is wide. Overall, this probabilistic forecasting model accurately measures uncertainties in forecasts and provides interpretable results that can support building managers and policymakers with the goal of reducing energy use.","[Roth, Jonathan; Chadalawada, Jayashree; Miller, Clayton] Natl Univ Singapore, Bldg & Urban Data Sci BUDS Lab, Singapore 119007, Singapore; [Roth, Jonathan; Jain, Rishee K.] Stanford Univ, Stanford Urban Informat Lab Civil & Environm Engn, Stanford, CA 94305 USA; [Chadalawada, Jayashree] Natl Univ Singapore, Civil & Environm Engn, Singapore 119007, Singapore",,"Miller, C (corresponding author), Natl Univ Singapore, Bldg & Urban Data Sci BUDS Lab, Singapore 119007, Singapore.",jonmroth.15@gmail.com; jayashree@u.nus.edu; rishee.jain@stanford.edu; clayton@nus.edu.sg,"Miller, Clayton/I-8813-2019","Miller, Clayton/0000-0002-1186-4299","Singapore National Research Foundation (NRF) BSEWWT (Behavioural Studies in the Energy, Water, Waste and Transport) Grant through the Future Resilient Systems (FRS) Laboratory at the Singapore ETH Centre (SEC); Precourt Institute for Energy; United States National Science FoundationNational Science Foundation (NSF) [1941695]","This research was supported by the Singapore National Research Foundation (NRF) BSEWWT (Behavioural Studies in the Energy, Water, Waste and Transport) Grant through the Future Resilient Systems (FRS) Laboratory at the Singapore ETH Centre (SEC).

The impacts of additional Arctic observations during summer are usually confined to high latitudes and they are difficult to realize at mid-latitudes because of the limited scale of localised tropopause polar vortices. However, in certain climatic states, the jet stream can intrude remarkably into the mid-latitudes, even in summer; thus, additional Arctic observations might improve analysis validity and forecast skill for summer atmospheric circulations over the Northern Hemisphere. This study examined such cases that occurred in 2016 by focusing on the prediction of the intensity and track of tropical cyclones (TCs) over the North Atlantic and North Pacific, because TCs are representative of extreme weather in summer. The predictabilities of three TCs were found influenced by additional Arctic observations. Comparisons with ensemble reanalysis data revealed that large errors propagate from the data-sparse Arctic into the mid-latitudes, together with high-potential-vorticity air. Ensemble forecast experiments with different reanalysis data confirmed that additional Arctic observations sometimes improve the initial conditions of upper-level troposphere circulations.","[Sato, Kazutoshi; Inoue, Jun] Natl Inst Polar Res, Tachikawa, Tokyo 1908518, Japan; [Sato, Kazutoshi] Kitami Inst Technol, Kitami, Hokkaido 0908507, Japan; [Inoue, Jun; Yamazaki, Akira] Japan Agcy Marine Earth Sci & Technol, Applicat Lab, Yokohama, Kanagawa 2360001, Japan; [Inoue, Jun] Grad Univ Adv Studies, SOKENDAI, Hayama 2400193, Japan; [Kim, Joo-Hong] Korea Polar Res Inst, Incheon 21990, South Korea; [Makshtas, Alexander; Kustov, Vasilli] Arctic & Antarctic Res Inst, St Petersburg 199397, Russia; [Maturilli, Marion; Dethloff, Klaus] Helmholtz Ctr Polar & Marine Res, Alfred Wegener Inst, D-14473 Potsdam, Germany",,"Sato, K (corresponding author), Natl Inst Polar Res, Tachikawa, Tokyo 1908518, Japan.; Sato, K (corresponding author), Kitami Inst Technol, Kitami, Hokkaido 0908507, Japan.",satokazu@mail.kitami-it.ac.jp,"Kustov, Vasilii Y./K-4576-2016; Maturilli, Marion/A-4344-2017; amplification, ³ - Arctic/AAU-6640-2020; Inoue, Jun/ABE-2305-2021","Kustov, Vasilii Y./0000-0001-9468-1991; Maturilli, Marion/0000-0001-6818-7383; Inoue, Jun/0000-0001-7738-6480; Sato, Kazutoshi/0000-0003-0216-8942","Arctic Challenge for Sustainability (ArCS) project; JSPS Overseas Research Fellowships; JSPS KAKENHIMinistry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology, Japan (MEXT)Japan Society for the Promotion of ScienceGrants-in-Aid for Scientific Research (KAKENHI) [18H03745]; KOPRI Asian Polar Science Fellowship Program; KPOPS (KOPRI) [PE18130]; K-AOOS (KOPRI) [20160245]; MOF, Korea; Ministry of Education and Science of the Russian FederationMinistry of Education and Science, Russian Federation [RFMEFI61617X0076]; ArctiC Amplification: Climate Relevant Atmospheric and SurfaCe Processes, and Feedback Mechanisms (AC)3 - DFG (Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft) [SFB/TR 172]","To access the CTL and OSE reanalyses and CTL and OSE forecast simulation data, please contact the corresponding author (satokazu@mail.kitami-it.ac.jp).

Using the graph convolutional network (GCN) is widespread in traffic Bow forecasting. Existing GCN-based methods mostly rely on undirected spatial correlations to represent the features of spatial-temporal graph. What's more, the traffic Bow renders two types of spatial correlations, including the stable correlation constrained by the fixed road structure and the dynamic correlation influenced by the traffic fluctuation. In this paper, we propose a two-stream graph convolutional network by considering stable and dynamic correlations in parallel, which is an end-to-end deep learning framework for dynamic traffic forecasting. We present an auto-decomposing layer to decompose real-time traffic flow data into a stable component and a dynamic component with different spatial correlations. Specifically, the stable component is constrained by the physical road network, and the dynamic component represents fluctuations caused by changes in traffic conditions such as congestion and bad weather. Moreover, we extract stable and dynamic spatial correlations through our two-stream graph convolutional layer. Finally, we use parameterized skip connection to fuse spatial-temporal correlations as the input of output layer for forecasting. Extensive experiments are conducted on two real-world traffic datasets, and experimental results show that our proposed model is better than several popular baselines.","[Li, Zhaoyang; Li, Lin; Peng, Yuquan] Wuhan Univ Technol, Sch Comp Sci & Technol, Wuhan, Peoples R China; [Tao, Xiaohui] Univ Southern Queensland, Sch Sci, Toowoomba, Qld, Australia",,"Li, L (corresponding author), Wuhan Univ Technol, Sch Comp Sci & Technol, Wuhan, Peoples R China.",237138@whut.edu.cn; cathylilin@whut.edu.cn; pengyuquan@whut.edu.cn; Xiaohui.Tao@usq.edu.au,,,Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Unverisities [205210003],Supported by the Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Unverisities under grant number 205210003.,,24,0,0,2,2,IEEE,NEW YORK,"345 E 47TH ST, NEW YORK, NY 10017 USA",1082-3409,,978-1-7281-9228-4,PROC INT C TOOLS ART,,,2020,,,,,,,355,362,,10.1109/lCTAI50040.2020.00063,,,8,"Computer Science, Artificial Intelligence",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S),Computer Science,BR4AM,WOS:000649734800053,,,,,2022-02-17

The focus of the company's business activity lies in stream of reusable parts, which is the most valuable, considering possibilities of selling (economic value) and resources saving (ecologic value). As a result of conducted research problem with demand forecasting was identified, which was affected by the specific domain of business. The major objective of the paper was to present how to support demand forecasting on parts in disassembling facility with the use of predictive markets. Methods: The problem area related to the demand forecasting in the disassembling companies was identified based on the previously conducted research and observations. The desk-research method was used to verify current knowledge on the forecasting methodology. Taking it into account, the predictive markets method was chosen in a specific research problem. Results: In the paper, the idea of predictive markets was presented. What is more, general procedure of its implementation and practical application in supporting decision in disassembling companies were described. Conclusions: Predictive markets which are based on the idea of crowdsourcing, use collective crowd intelligence, supporting many business areas, including automotive industry. The predictive market method was successfully adopted in disassembling facility in order to support decisions on demand forecasting of reusable parts.

TROPICS consists of six CubeSats, each hosting a passive microwave radiometer that provides radiance observations sensitive to atmospheric temperature, water vapor, precipitation, and precipitation-sized ice particles. In this study, the impact of TROPICS all-sky radiances on TC analyses and forecasts is explored through a regional mesoscale observing system simulation experiment (OSSE). The results indicate that the TROPICS all-sky radiances can have positive impacts on TC track and intensity forecasts, particularly when some hydrometeor state variables and other state variables of the data assimilation system that are relevant to cloudy radiance assimilation are updated. The largest impact on the model analyses is seen in the humidity fields, regardless of whether or not there are radiances assimilated from other satellites. TROPICS radiances demonstrate large impact on TC analyses and forecasts when other satellite radiances are absent. The assimilation of the all-sky TROPICS radiances without default radiances leads to a consistent improvement in the low- and midtropospheric temperature and wind forecasts throughout the 5-day forecasts, but only up to 36-h lead time in the humidity forecasts at all pressure levels. This study illustrates the potential benefits of TROPICS data assimilation for TC forecasts and provides a potentially streamlined pathway for transitioning TROPICS data from research to operations postlaunch. Significance Statement As the Global Observing System evolves, smaller satellites such as CubeSats are emerging as inexpensive alternatives for providing important observations of Earth as compared to traditional satellites. TROPICS, to be launched in January 2022, is one of the NASA CubeSats missions that will deliver unprecedented rapid-update microwave measurements over the tropics. This study examines the impacts of simulated radiances from the TROPICS constellation of satellites for tropical cyclone analyses and forecasts in a regional mesoscale model and demonstrates the potential benefits of TROPICS data assimilation on TC forecasts. The infrastructure to incorporate the new TROPICS datasets into the operational model that was developed for this study will facilitate a transition from research to operations once the TROPICS data becomes available after the mission launch.","[Christophersen, Hui W.] Naval Res Lab, Monterey, CA 93943 USA; [Dahl, Brittany A.; Dunion, Jason P.] Univ Miami, Cooperat Inst Marine & Atmospher Studies, Miami, FL USA; [Dahl, Brittany A.; Dunion, Jason P.; Rogers, Robert F.; Marks, Frank D.] NOAA, Atlantic Oceanog & Meteorol Lab, Hurricane Res Div, Miami, FL 33149 USA; [Atlas, Robert] NOAA, Atlantic Oceanog & Meteorol Lab, Miami, FL 33149 USA; [Blackwell, William J.] MIT, Lincoln Lab, 244 Wood St, Lexington, MA 02173 USA",,"Christophersen, HW (corresponding author), Naval Res Lab, Monterey, CA 93943 USA.",hui.christophersen@nrlmry.navy.mil,"Marks, Frank D./A-5733-2011","Marks, Frank D./0000-0003-0371-5514",TROPICS Project [NA20OAR4320472]; ONR Project [N0001420WX01497]; NOAANational Oceanic Atmospheric Admin (NOAA) - USA [NA67RJ0149]; University of Miami [NA67RJ0149],"The authors acknowledge funding support from the TROPICS Project (NA20OAR4320472), ONR Project (N0001420WX01497), and partial funding support provided through the Cooperative Agreement NA67RJ0149 between NOAA and University of Miami.

Recent extreme summers in western Europe and North America have highlighted the need for greater understanding of this variability, in order to aid seasonal forecasting and mitigate societal, environmental and economic impacts. Here we find that simple linear regression and composite models based on a few predictable factors are able to explain up to 35 % of summertime jet stream speed and latitude variability from 1955 onwards. Sea surface temperature forcings impact predominantly on jet speed, whereas solar and cryospheric forcings appear to influence jet latitude. The cryospheric associations come from the previous autumn, suggesting the survival of an ice-induced signal through the winter season, whereas solar influences lead jet variability by a few years. Regression models covering the earlier part of the twentieth century are much less effective, presumably due to decreased availability of data, and increased uncertainty in observational reanalyses. Wavelet coherence analysis identifies that associations fluctuate over the study period but it is not clear whether this is just internal variability or genuine non-stationarity. Finally we identify areas for future research.","[Hall, Richard J.; Jones, Julie M.; Hanna, Edward] Univ Sheffield, Dept Geog, Winter St, Sheffield S10 2TN, S Yorkshire, England; [Scaife, Adam A.] Met Off Hadley Ctr, Exeter, Devon, England; [Erdelyi, Robert] Univ Sheffield, Sch Math & Stat, Solar Phys & Space Plasma Res Ctr, Sheffield, S Yorkshire, England; [Erdelyi, Robert] Hungarian Acad Sci, Debrecen Heliophys Observ, Res Ctr Astron & Earth Sci, POB 30, H-4010 Debrecen, Hungary",,"Hall, RJ (corresponding author), Univ Sheffield, Dept Geog, Winter St, Sheffield S10 2TN, S Yorkshire, England.; Scaife, AA (corresponding author), Met Off Hadley Ctr, Exeter, Devon, England.",rjhall1@sheffield.ac.uk; adam.scaife@metoffice.gov.uk,"erdelyi, robertus/AAQ-3262-2020; Hanna, Edward/W-5927-2019","erdelyi, robertus/0000-0003-3439-4127; Hanna, Edward/0000-0002-8683-182X; Jones, Julie/0000-0003-2892-8647","Joint DECC/Defra Met Office Hadley Centre Programme [GA1101]; University of Sheffield Project Sunshine; U.S. Department of Energy, Office of Science Innovative and Novel Computational Impact on Theory and Experiment (DOE INCITE) programUnited States Department of Energy (DOE); Office of Biological and Environmental Research (BER); National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration Climate Program OfficeNational Oceanic Atmospheric Admin (NOAA) - USA","AAS was supported by the Joint DECC/Defra Met Office Hadley Centre Programme (GA1101).

These UAS observations, spanning seven flights over 5 days in the lowest 1550 m above mean sea level, were assimilated into a three-dimensional variational data assimilation (DA) system [the Naval Research Laboratory Atmospheric Variational Data Assimilation System (NAVDAS)] used to generate analyses for a numerical weather prediction model [the Coupled Ocean-Atmosphere Mesoscale Prediction System (COAMPS)] with a coupled ocean model [the Naval Research Laboratory Navy Coastal Ocean Model (NCOM)]. The impact of the assimilated UAS observations on short-term atmospheric prediction performance is evaluated and quantified. Observations collected from 50 radiosonde launches during the campaign adjacent to the UAS flight paths serve as model forecast verification. Experiments reveal a substantial reduction of model bias in forecast temperature and moisture profiles consistently throughout the campaign period due to the assimilation of UAS observations. The model error reduction is most substantial in the vicinity of the inversion at the top of the model-estimated boundary layer. Investigations reveal a consistent improvement to prediction of the vertical position, strength, and depth of the boundary layer inversion. The relative impact of UAS observations is explored further with experiments of systematic denial of data streams from the NAVDAS DA system and removal of individual measurement sources on the UAS platform.","[Flagg, David D.; Doyle, James D.; Holt, Teddy R.; Tyndall, Daniel P.; Amerault, Clark M.; Haack, Tracy; Moskaitis, Jonathan R.; Nachamkin, Jason] Naval Res Lab, Marine Meteorol Div, Monterey, CA 93943 USA; [Geiszler, Daniel] Sci Applicat Int Corp, San Diego, CA 92121 USA; [Eleuterio, Daniel P.] Off Naval Res, Arlington, VA 22217 USA",,"Flagg, DD (corresponding author), Naval Res Lab, Marine Meteorol Div, Monterey, CA 93943 USA.",david.flagg@nrlmry.navy.mil,,"Tyndall, Dan/0000-0002-1424-7149",Office of Naval ResearchOffice of Naval Research [0602435N]; Office of Naval ResearchOffice of Naval Research; Naval Research LaboratoryUnited States Department of Defense,"The authors acknowledge support from the Office of Naval Research's Program Element 0602435N.

These schemes are formulated using a set of parameters that must be determined using physical knowledge and/or to obtain a desired outcome. Here, a methodology is developed for assessing the effect of four factors on spatial features of forecasts simulated by the SKEBS-enabled Weather Research and Forecasting model. The four factors include two physically motivated SKEBS parameters (the determining amplitude of perturbations applied to stream function and potential temperature tendencies), a purely stochastic element (a seed used in generating random perturbations) and a factor reflecting daily variability. A simple threshold-based approach for identifying coherent objects within forecast fields is employed, and the effect of the four factors on object features (e.g. number, size and intensity) is assessed. Four object types are examined: upper-air jet streaks, low-level jets, precipitation areas and frontal boundaries. The proposed method consists of a set of standard techniques in experimental design, based on the analysis of variance, tailored to sensitivity analysis. More specifically, a Latin square design is employed to reduce the number of model simulations necessary for performing the sensitivity analysis. Fixed effects and random effects models are employed to assess the main effects and the percentage of the total variability explained by the four factors. It is found that the two SKEBS parameters do not have an appreciable and/or statistically significant effect on any of the examined object features.","[Marzban, Caren; Sandgathe, Scott] Univ Washington, Appl Phys Lab, Seattle, WA 98105 USA; [Marzban, Caren] Univ Washington, Dept Stat, Seattle, WA 98195 USA; [Tardif, Robert; Hryniw, Natalia] Univ Washington, Dept Atmospher Sci, Seattle, WA 98195 USA",,"Marzban, C (corresponding author), Univ Washington, Box 354322, Seattle, WA 98195 USA.",marzban@u.washington.edu,"Tardif, Robert/D-3842-2013","Tardif, Robert/0000-0003-1313-0878",Division of Atmospheric and Geospace SciencesNational Science Foundation (NSF)NSF - Directorate for Geosciences (GEO) [AGS-1402895]; Office of Naval Research GlobalOffice of Naval Research [N00014-12-G-0078]; National Science FoundationNational Science Foundation (NSF); Office of Naval ResearchOffice of Naval Research,"Division of Atmospheric and Geospace Sciences, Grant/Award Number: AGS-1402895; Office of Naval Research Global, Grant/Award Number: N00014-12-G-0078; National Science Foundation; Office of Naval Research",,38,2,2,1,1,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",1350-4827,1469-8080,,METEOROL APPL,Meteorol.

This paper as part of the Seven SouthEast Asian Studies (7-SEAS) project effort attempts to improve the chemical weather prediction capability of the Weather Research and Forecasting coupled with the Community Multiscale for Air Quality (WRF-CMAQ) model over a vast region, from the mountainous near-source burning sites at nPSEA to its downwind region. Several sensitivity analyses of plume rise are compared in the paper, and it is discovered that the initial vertical allocation profile of BB plumes and the plume rise module (PLMRIM) are the main reasons causing the inaccuracies of the WRF-CMAQ simulations. The smoldering emission from the Western Regional Air Partnership (WRAP) empirical algorithm included has improved the accuracies of PM10, O-3 and CO at the source. The best performance at the downwind sites is achieved with the inline PLMRIM, which accounts for the atmospheric stratification at the mountainous source region with the FINN burning emission dataset. Such a setup greatly improves not only the BB aerosol concentration prediction over near-source and receptor ground-based measurement sites but also the aerosol vertical distribution and column aerosol optical depth of the BB aerosol along the transport route. The BB aerosols from nPSEA are carried by the subtropical westerlies in the free troposphere to the western North Pacific, while BB aerosol has been found to interact with the local pollutants in the Taiwan region through three conditions: (a) overpassing western Taiwan and entering the central mountain area, (b) mixing down to western Taiwan, (c) transport of local pollutants upwards and mixing with a BB plume on higher ground. The second condition, which involves the prevailing high-pressure system from Asian cold surge, is able to impact most of the population in Taiwan.","[Ooi, Maggie Chel-Gee; Kong, Steven S.; Wang, Sheng-Hsiang; Pani, Shantanu Kumar; Lin, Neng-Huei] Natl Cent Univ, Dept Atmospher Sci, Taoyuan 32001, Taiwan; [Ooi, Maggie Chel-Gee] Natl Univ Malaysia, Inst Climate Change, Bangi 43600, Malaysia; [Chuang, Ming-Tung] Acad Sinica, Res Ctr Environm Change, Taipei 11529, Taiwan; [Fu, Joshua S.] Univ Tennessee, Dept Civil & Environm Engn, Knoxville, TN 37996 USA; [Huang, Wei-Syun; Wang, Sheng-Hsiang; Lin, Neng-Huei] Natl Cent Univ, Ctr Environm Monitoring Technol, Taoyuan 32001, Taiwan; [Pimonsree, Sittichai] Univ Phayao, Sch Energy & Environm, Atmospher Pollut & Climate Change Res Unit, Phayao 56000, Thailand; [Chan, Andy] Univ Nottingham Malaysia, Dept Civil Engn, Semenyih 43500, Malaysia",,"Lin, NH (corresponding author), Natl Cent Univ, Dept Atmospher Sci, Taoyuan 32001, Taiwan.; Lin, NH (corresponding author), Natl Cent Univ, Ctr Environm Monitoring Technol, Taoyuan 32001, Taiwan.",nhlin@cc.ncu.edu.tw,"Pani, Shantanu Kumar/I-6908-2018; Kong, Steven Soon-Kai/O-7961-2014; Wang, Sheng-Hsiang/AAA-3905-2021; Wang, Sheng-Hsiang/F-4532-2010","Pani, Shantanu Kumar/0000-0002-9949-2329; pimonsree, sittichai/0000-0002-9612-4205; Wang, Sheng-Hsiang/0000-0001-9675-3135; Soon-Kai Kong, Steven/0000-0002-7297-7393","Ministry of Science and Technology, TaiwanMinistry of Science and Technology, Taiwan; MOST [107-2811-M-008-033]; Environmental Protection Administration, Executive Yuan, R.O.C.

No formal, citable space exists for forecasters to communicate needs and lessons learned to the research community (O2R). This deficit was termed the valleys of death and lost opportunities (NRC, 2003, ) and has resulted in advancements taking up to 20 years or more to become forecast operational. To provide this communication space, we surveyed a group of US civilian space weather forecasters on their needed improvements, use of available resources, and interactions with researchers, via a combination of questionnaire and focus group discussions. Nineteen needed improvements were identified, clustering into four categories: scientific understanding, access to data, forecast office tools, and instrumentation. Participants appeared to prefer resources with a robust data stream of high-resolution and high-time cadence data which suffer few technical issues. Participants want to be included in tool development more often and earlier in the process as they felt they were seldom listened to when it comes to what [they] actually need.","[Butler, E.

In this work, we perform numerical simulations using the first-principles models Global Ionosphere-Thermosphere Model (GITM) and Thermosphere-Ionosphere Electrodynamics General Circulation Model (TIE-GCM) to address the reliability of thermospheric-ionospheric forecasts. When considering forecasts applicable to periods of geomagnetic activity, careful consideration is required of model inputs, which largely determine how the models will simulate disturbed conditions. We adopt an approach to drive the models with solar wind parameters and the 10.7 cm solar radio flux. This aligns our investigation with recent research and operational activities to forecast solar wind conditions on the Earth a few days in advance. In this work, we examine a weak geomagnetic storm, the June 2012 high-speed-stream event, for which we drive GITM and TIE-GCM with observed solar wind and F10.7 values. We find general agreement between the simulations and observation-based Global Ionospheric Maps of the total electron content (TEC) response. However, overestimated TEC response is found in the middle to low latitudinal region of the American sector and surrounding areas for both GITM and TIE-GCM during similar time periods. By conducting numerical modeling experiments and comparing the modeling results with observational data, we find that the overestimated TEC response can be almost equally attributed to the solar wind driving and F10.7 driving during the June 2012 event. We conclude that the accuracy of the high-latitude electric field and the solar irradiance is crucial to reproduce the TEC response in forecastable-mode modeling.","[Meng, Xing; Mannucci, Anthony J.; Verkhoglyadova, Olga P.; Tsurutani, Bruce T.] CALTECH, Jet Prop Lab, Pasadena, CA 91125 USA; [Ridley, Aaron J.] Univ Michigan, Dept Climate & Space Sci & Engn, Ann Arbor, MI 48109 USA; [Shim, Ja-Soon] Catholic Univ Amer, NASA GSFC, Greenbelt, MD USA",,"Meng, X (corresponding author), CALTECH, Jet Prop Lab, Pasadena, CA 91125 USA.",Xing.Meng@jpl.nasa.gov,,,,,,72,2,2,2,3,AMER GEOPHYSICAL UNION,WASHINGTON,"2000 FLORIDA AVE NW, WASHINGTON, DC 20009 USA",,1542-7390,,SPACE WEATHER,Space Weather,FEB,2020,18,2,,,,,,,e2019SW002352,10.1029/2019SW002352,,,20,Astronomy & Astrophysics; Geochemistry & Geophysics; Meteorology & Atmospheric Sciences,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),Astronomy & Astrophysics; Geochemistry & Geophysics; Meteorology & Atmospheric Sciences,KS0WJ,WOS:000518032300009,,"Green Published, hybrid",,,2022-02-17

Since the model includes a finite-difference scheme for spatial derivatives, the discretization errors may affect the simulation results. We focus here on understanding the effects of finite-difference schemes on the momentum balance and the mean velocity distribution, and the requirement (or not) of the ad hoc canopy model. We find that, unlike the Smagorinsky and turbulent kinetic energy (TKE) models, the calculated mean velocity and vertical shear using the modulated-gradient model, are in good agreement with Monin-Obukhov similarity theory, without the need for an extra near-wall canopy model. The structure of the near-wall turbulent eddies is better resolved using the modulated-gradient model in comparison with the classical Smagorinsky and TKE models, which are too dissipative and yield unrealistic smoothing of the smallest resolved scales. Moreover, the SGS fluxes obtained from the modulated-gradient model are much smaller near the wall in comparison with those obtained from the regular Smagorinsky and TKE models. The apparent inability of the LES model in reproducing the mean streamwise component of the momentum balance using the total (resolved plus SGS) stress near the surface is probably due to the effect of the discretization errors, which can be calculated a posteriori using the Taylor-series expansion of the resolved velocity field. Overall, we demonstrate that the modulated-gradient model is less dissipative and yields more accurate results in comparison with the classical Smagorinsky model, with similar computational costs.","[Khani, Sina; Porte-Agel, Fernando] Ecole Polytech Fed Lausanne, Wind Engn & Renewable Energy Lab WiRE, CH-1015 Lausanne, Switzerland; [Khani, Sina] Princeton Univ, Program Atmospher & Ocean Sci, Princeton, NJ 08544 USA",,"Khani, S (corresponding author), Ecole Polytech Fed Lausanne, Wind Engn & Renewable Energy Lab WiRE, CH-1015 Lausanne, Switzerland.; Khani, S (corresponding author), Princeton Univ, Program Atmospher & Ocean Sci, Princeton, NJ 08544 USA.",skhani@princeton.edu,"Porté-Agel, Fernando/AAP-5492-2020; Khani, Sina/F-7975-2016","Porte-Agel, Fernando/0000-0002-9913-3350; Khani, Sina/0000-0002-8319-4263","Swiss Federal Office of Energy (OFEN); Swiss Innovation and Technology Committee (CTI); Princeton University, Princeton, NJ, USAPrinceton University","The paper benefited from the comments of five anonymous reviewers.
