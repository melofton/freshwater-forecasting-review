714,A Simple Method for Simulating Groundwater Interactions with Fens to Forecast Development Effects,"Protection of fens-wetlands dependent on groundwater discharge-requires characterization of groundwater sources and stresses. Because instrumentation and numerical modeling of fens is labor intensive, easy-to-apply methods that model fen distribution and their vulnerability to development are desirable. Here we demonstrate that fen areas can be simulated using existing steady-state MODFLOW models when the unsaturated zone flow (UZF) package is included. In cells where the water table is near land surface, the UZF package calculates a head difference and scaled conductance at these seepage drain cells to generate average rates of vertical seepage to the land. This formulation, which represents an alternative to blanketing the MODFLOW domain with drains, requires very little input from the user because unsaturated flow-routing is inactive and results are primarily driven by easily obtained topographic information. Like the drain approach, it has the advantage that the distribution of seepage areas is not predetermined by the modeler, but rather emerges from simulated heads. Beyond the drain approach, it takes account of intracell land surface variation to explicitly quantify multiple surficial flows corresponding to infiltration, rejected recharge, recharge and land-surface seepage. Application of the method to a basin in southeastern Wisconsin demonstrates how it can be used as a decision-support tool to first, reproduce fen distribution and, second, forecast drawdown and reduced seepage at fens in response to shallow pumping.",https://doi.org/10.1111/gwat.12931,10.1111/gwat.12931,J,"Feinstein, DT; Hart, DJ; Gatzke, S; Hunt, RJ; Niswonger, RG; Fienen, MN",NA,NA,NA,"Feinstein, Daniel T.; Hart, David J.; Gatzke, Sarah; Hunt, Randall J.; Niswonger, Richard G.; Fienen, Michael N.",NA,NA,y,GROUNDWATER,NA,NA,English,Article,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,FLOW; WATER; HYDROLOGY; RECHARGE; LAKE,"[Feinstein, Daniel T.] Univ Wisconsin, Upper Midwest Water Sci Ctr, US Geol Survey, Lapham Hall,Room 338,3209 North Maryland Ave, Milwaukee, WI 53211 USA; [Hart, David J.] Univ Wisconsin, Wisconsin Geol & Nat Hist Survey, 3817 Mineral Point Rd, Madison, WI 53705 USA; [Gatzke, Sarah] Nature Conservancy, Mukwonago River Watershed Off, East Troy, WI 53120 USA; [Hunt, Randall J.; Fienen, Michael N.] US Geol Survey, Upper Midwest Water Sci Ctr, 8505 Res Way, Middleton, WI 53562 USA; [Niswonger, Richard G.] US Geol Survey, Water Resources Mission Area, 345 Middlefield Rd, Menlo Pk, CA 94025 USA",NA,"Hart, DJ (corresponding author), Univ Wisconsin, Wisconsin Geol & Nat Hist Survey, 3817 Mineral Point Rd, Madison, WI 53705 USA.",david.hart@wisc.edu,"Fienen, Michael N/D-2479-2009","Fienen, Michael N/0000-0002-7756-4651",The Nature Conservancy; U.S. Geological SurveyUnited States Geological Survey,"We thank The Nature Conservancy for funding this work as part of its ongoing efforts to protect water resources.

715,An Efficient Approach for Estimating Streamflow Forecast Skill Elasticity,"Seasonal streamflow prediction skill can derive from catchment initial hydrological conditions (IHCs) and from the future seasonal climate forecasts (SCFs) used to produce the hydrological forecasts. Although much effort has gone into producing state-of-the-art seasonal streamflow forecasts from improving IHCs and SCFs, these developments are expensive and time consuming and the forecasting skill is still limited inmost parts of the world. Hence, sensitivity analyses are crucial to funnel the resources into useful modeling and forecasting developments. It is in this context that a sensitivity analysis technique, the variational ensemble streamflow prediction assessment (VESPA) approach, was recently introduced. VESPA can be used to quantify the expected improvements in seasonal streamflow forecast skill as a result of realistic improvements in its predictability sources (i.e., the IHCs and the SCFs)-termed skill elasticity''- and to indicate where efforts should be targeted. The VESPA approach is, however, computationally expensive, relying on multiple hindcasts having varying levels of skill in IHCs and SCFs. This paper presents two approximations of the approach that are computationally inexpensive alternatives. These new methods were tested against the original VESPA results using 30 years of ensemble hindcasts for 18 catchments of the contiguous United States. The results suggest that one of themethods, end point blending, is an effective alternative for estimating the forecast skill elasticities yielded by the VESPA approach. The results also highlight the importance of the choice of verification score for a goal- oriented sensitivity analysis.",https://doi.org/10.1175/JHM-D-16-0259.1,10.1175/JHM-D-16-0259.1,J,"Arnal, L; Wood, AW; Stephens, E; Cloke, HL; Pappenberger, F",NA,NA,NA,"Arnal, Louise; Wood, Andrew W.; Stephens, Elisabeth; Cloke, Hannah L.; Pappenberger, Florian",NA,NA,y,JOURNAL OF HYDROMETEOROLOGY,NA,NA,English,Article,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,GLOBAL SENSITIVITY-ANALYSIS; SOIL-MOISTURE; RIVER BASIN; PREDICTABILITY; UNCERTAINTY; PREDICTION; SYSTEM; COLUMBIA; MODELS,"[Arnal, Louise; Stephens, Elisabeth; Cloke, Hannah L.] Univ Reading, Dept Geog & Environm Sci, Shinfield Pk, Reading, Berks, England; [Arnal, Louise; Pappenberger, Florian] European Ctr Medium Range Weather Forecasts, Shinfield Pk, Reading, Berks, England; [Wood, Andrew W.] NCAR, Res Applicat Lab, Boulder, CO USA; [Cloke, Hannah L.] Univ Reading, Dept Meteorol, Reading, Berks, England; [Pappenberger, Florian] Univ Bristol, Sch Geog Sci, Bristol, Avon, England",NA,"Arnal, L (corresponding author), Univ Reading, Dept Geog & Environm Sci, Shinfield Pk, Reading, Berks, England.; Arnal, L (corresponding author), European Ctr Medium Range Weather Forecasts, Shinfield Pk, Reading, Berks, England.",l.l.s.arnal@pgr.reading.ac.uk,"Pappenberger, Florian/A-2839-2009","Pappenberger, Florian/0000-0003-1766-2898; Arnal, Louise/0000-0002-0208-2324; Cloke, Hannah/0000-0002-1472-868X; Stephens, Elisabeth/0000-0002-5439-7563",Horizon IMPREX project [641811]; Leverhulme Early Career FellowshipLeverhulme Trust [ECF-2013-492]; National Science FoundationNational Science Foundation (NSF); U.S. Bureau of Reclamation [R11AC80816]; U.S. Army Corps of Engineers (USACE) Climate Preparedness and Resilience Program [1254557],"L.

716,Hydrological drought forecasts outperform meteorological drought forecasts,"One of the most effective strategies to reduce the impacts of drought is by issuing a timely and targeted warning from month to seasons ahead to end users. Yet to accurately forecast the drought hazard on a sub-seasonal to seasonal time scale remains a challenge, and usually, meteorological drought is forecasted instead of hydrological drought, although the latter is more relevant for several impacted sectors. Therefore, we evaluate the hydro-meteorological drought forecast skill for the pan-European region using categorical drought classification method. The results show that the hydrological drought forecasts outperform the meteorological drought forecasts. Hydrological drought forecasts even show predictive power (area with perfect prediction > 50%) beyond two months ahead. Our study also concludes that dynamical forecasts, derived from seasonal forecasts, have higher predictability than ensemble streamflow predictions. The results suggest that further development of seasonal hydrological drought forecasting systems are beneficial, particularly important in the context of global warming, where drought hazard will become more frequent and severe in multiple regions in the world.",https://doi.org/10.1088/1748-9326/ab8b13,10.1088/1748-9326/ab8b13,J,"Sutanto, SJ; Wetterhall, F; Van Lanen, HAJ",NA,NA,NA,"Sutanto, Samuel J.; Wetterhall, Fredrik; Van Lanen, Henny A.

717,Benchmarking an operational hydrological model for providing seasonal forecasts in Sweden,"Probabilistic seasonal forecasts are important for many water-intensive activities requiring long-term planning. Among the different techniques used for seasonal forecasting, the ensemble streamflow prediction (ESP) approach has long been employed due to the singular dependence on past meteorological records. The Swedish Meteorological and Hydrological Institute is currently extending the use of long-range forecasts within its operational warning service, which requires a thorough analysis of the suitability and applicability of different methods with the national S-HYPE hydrological model. To this end, we aim to evaluate the skill of ESP forecasts over 39 493 catchments in Sweden, understand their spatio-temporal patterns, and explore the main hydrological processes driving forecast skill. We found that ESP forecasts are generally skilful for most of the country up to 3 months into the future but that large spatio-temporal variations exist. Forecasts are most skilful during the winter months in northern Sweden, except for the highly regulated hydropower-producing rivers. The relationships between forecast skill and 15 different hydrological signatures show that forecasts are most skilful for slow-reacting, baseflow-dominated catchments and least skilful for flashy catchments. Finally, we show that forecast skill patterns can be spatially clustered in seven unique regions with similar hydrological behaviour. Overall, these results contribute to identifying in which areas and seasons and how long into the future ESP hydrological forecasts provide an added value, not only for the national forecasting and warning service, but also, most importantly, for guiding decision making in critical services such as hydropower management and risk reduction.",https://doi.org/10.5194/hess-25-1189-2021,10.5194/hess-25-1189-2021,J,"Lopez, MG; Crochemore, L; Pechlivanidis, IG",NA,NA,NA,"Lopez, Marc Girons; Crochemore, Louise; Pechlivanidis, Ilias G.",NA,NA,y,HYDROLOGY AND EARTH SYSTEM SCIENCES,NA,NA,English,Article,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,STREAMFLOW PREDICTION; SYSTEM; SKILL; WATER; DECOMPOSITION; FRAMEWORK; BEHAVIOR; RECORDS; EUROPE; ERRORS,"[Lopez, Marc Girons; Crochemore, Louise; Pechlivanidis, Ilias G.] Swedish Meteorol & Hydrol Inst, S-60176 Norrkoping, Sweden; [Crochemore, Louise] INRAE, UR Riverly, F-69100 Villeurbanne, France",NA,"Lopez, MG (corresponding author), Swedish Meteorol & Hydrol Inst, S-60176 Norrkoping, Sweden.",marc.girons@smhi.se,"Pechlivanidis, Ilias/AAC-6979-2019; Girons Lopez, Marc/B-7097-2015","Pechlivanidis, Ilias/0000-0002-3416-317X; Girons Lopez, Marc/0000-0002-0835-8897","Swedish Energy AgencySwedish Energy AgencyMaterials & Energy Research Center (MERC) [46412-1]; EUEuropean Commission [870497, 776787]",This work was funded by the project Longterm forecasts of wind and hydropower supply in a fluctuating climate -Importance for production planning and investments in energy storage and power transmission granted by the Swedish Energy Agency (grant no. 46412-1).

718,"Quantifying projected changes in runoff variability and flow regimes of the Fraser River Basin, British Columbia","In response to ongoing and future-projected global warming, mid-latitude, nival river basins are expected to transition from a snowmelt-dominated flow regime to a nival-pluvial one with an earlier spring freshet of reduced magnitude. There is, however, a rich variation in responses that depends on factors such as the topographic complexity of the basin and the strength of maritime influences. We illustrate the potential effects of a strong maritime influence by studying future changes in cold season flow variability in the Fraser River Basin (FRB) of British Columbia, a large extratropical watershed extending from the Rocky Mountains to the Pacific Coast. We use a process-based hydrological model driven by an ensemble of 21 statistically down-scaled simulations from the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project Phase 5 (CMIP5), following the Representative Concentration Pathway 8.5 (RCP 8.5). Warming under RCP 8.5 leads to reduced winter snowfall, shortening the average snow accumulation season by about one-third. Despite this, large increases in cold season rainfall lead to unprecedented cold season peak flows and increased overall runoff variability in the VIC simulations. Increased cold season rainfall is shown to be the dominant climatic driver in the Coast Mountains, contributing 60 % to mean cold season runoff changes in the 2080s. Cold season runoff at the outlet of the basin increases by 70 % by the 2080s, and its interannual variability more than doubles when compared to the 1990s, suggesting substantial challenges for operational flow forecasting in the region. Furthermore, almost half of the basin (45 %) transitions from a snow-dominated runoff regime in the 1990s to a primarily rain-dominated regime in the 2080s, according to a snowmelt pulse detection algorithm. While these projections are consistent with the anticipated transition from a nival to a nival-pluvial hydrologic regime, the marked increase in FRB cold season runoff is likely linked to more frequent landfalling atmospheric rivers in the region projected in the CMIP5 models, providing in-sights for other maritime-influenced extratropical basins.",https://doi.org/10.5194/hess-23-811-2019,10.5194/hess-23-811-2019,J,"Ul Islam, S; Curry, CL; Dery, SJ; Zwiers, FW",NA,NA,NA,"Ul Islam, Siraj; Curry, Charles L.; Dery, Stephen J.; Zwiers, Francis W.",NA,NA,y,HYDROLOGY AND EARTH SYSTEM SCIENCES,NA,NA,English,Article,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,REGIONAL-SCALE HYDROLOGY; CLIMATE-CHANGE IMPACTS; LAND-SURFACE WATER; ATMOSPHERIC RIVERS; SOIL-MOISTURE; NORTH-AMERICA; VIC-2L MODEL; FUTURE CLIMATE; FOREST CHANGE; WEST-COAST,"[Ul Islam, Siraj; Dery, Stephen J.] Univ Northern British Columbia, Environm Sci & Engn Program, Prince George, BC V2N 4Z9, Canada; [Curry, Charles L.; Zwiers, Francis W.] Univ Victoria, Pacific Climate Impacts Consortium, Victoria, BC V8W 2Y2, Canada",NA,"Ul Islam, S (corresponding author), Univ Northern British Columbia, Environm Sci & Engn Program, Prince George, BC V2N 4Z9, Canada.",sirajul.islam@unbc.ca,"Islam, Siraj Ul/Z-1665-2019",NA,Canadian Sea Ice and Snow Evolution (CanSISE) Network - Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada (NSERC); Mountain Water Futures (MWF) initiative of the Global Water Futures (GWF) program; Nechako Environmental Enhancement Fund (NEEF),"This work was supported by the Canadian Sea Ice and Snow Evolution (CanSISE) Network funded by the Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada (NSERC), the Mountain Water Futures (MWF) initiative of the Global Water Futures (GWF) program and the Nechako Environmental Enhancement Fund (NEEF).

719,Techniques to evaluate the modifier process of National Weather Service flood forecasts,"The operational hydrologists of the United States' National Weather Service (NWS) develop river forecasts as guidance for those at risk of flood damage and update those flood forecasts in real-time as more information becomes available. To do so they rely on experience and intuition to adjust the inputs, state variables, and parameters of hydrologic models. NWS hydrologists use the term modifiers to refer collectively to these adjustments. This paper demonstrates the development and application of tools (statistical and graphical) to aid operational hydrologists in the achievement of accurate flood forecasts. Analysis of variance (ANOVA) identifies the relative contribution to forecast uncertainty of each modifier. Heat map visualizations illustrate for operational hydrologists the basin, lead-time, and season-specific effects of their modifiers choices. The tools provide operational hydrologists with insight into which of three commonly applied modifiers (precipitation, soil moisture, and unit hydrograph shape) are most likely to provide improvement in flood forecast accuracy. The tools are demonstrated for a case study of four watersheds within in the Ohio River Valley, using data for flood events sampled from 1990 to 2018. The findings of this research show that operational hydrologists in the Ohio River Basin would do well apply no modifiers in the winter (leaving hydrologic input variables and parameters at baseline values). And though the forecast might be improved by real-time adjustments to the unit hydrograph in summer months, recommendations for particular unit hydrograph modification levels cannot be made with confidence. These findings call into question the modifier adjustment program as a standard process. In the evaluated cases, modifiers do not systematically improve flood forecasts. Improvement may be more efficiently achieved through better calibration of hydrologic models or techniques for reduction of precipitation uncertainty.",https://doi.org/10.1016/j.hydroa.2020.100073,10.1016/j.hydroa.2020.100073,J,"Zhu, ZP; Wasti, A; Schade, T; Ray, PA",NA,NA,NA,"Zhu, Zhipeng; Wasti, Asphota; Schade, Trent; Ray, Patrick A.",NA,NA,y,JOURNAL OF HYDROLOGY X,NA,NA,English,Article,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,Flood forecast uncertainty; Operational hydrology; ANOVA; Data visualization; Heat maps; National Weather Service,PRECIPITATION; ENSEMBLE; UNCERTAINTY; VERIFICATION; RADAR; MODEL; AUTOMATION; WSR-88D; REGIMES; SYSTEM,"[Zhu, Zhipeng; Wasti, Asphota; Ray, Patrick A.] Univ Cincinnati, Coll Engn & Appl Sci, Cincinnati, OH 45220 USA; [Schade, Trent] Natl Weather Serv, Ohio River Forecast Ctr, Wilmington, OH USA",NA,"Ray, PA (corresponding author), Univ Cincinnati, Coll Engn & Appl Sci, Cincinnati, OH 45220 USA.",patrick.ray@uc.edu,NA,"Ray, Patrick/0000-0001-9495-2317","University Corporation for Atmospheric Research: COMET Program (National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration) [NA16NWS4670042, SUBAWD000724]","This work was funded by the University Corporation for Atmospheric Research: COMET Program (National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration Prime Award Number: NA16NWS4670042, UCAR subcontract SUBAWD000724).

720,Projected Changes to Extreme Runoff and Precipitation Events From a Downscaled Simulation Over the Western United States,"Extreme precipitation and runoff events, which often impact natural and social systems more than mean changes, generally occur over regional scales. Future climate projections can be used to estimate how the hydrologic cycle may change, but the coarse resolution of global climate models (GCMs) (>1 degrees) makes it difficult to evaluate regional changes, such as over a single watershed. To estimate changes in hydroclimatic variables at finer spatial resolutions, we dynamically downscale the Community Climate System Model version 4 (CCSM4) with the Weather Research and Forecasting (WRF) regional climate model over the western United States at 9 km spatial resolution. By running WRF at a higher spatial resolution, we estimate future climate conditions, including 99% event magnitude, over 17 watersheds: the Columbia, Lower Colorado, Upper Colorado, the Upper Missouri/Yellowstone, and 12 basins draining the western slope of the Sierra Nevada in California. Over each basin, we compare a historical period (1996-2005) with mid-century (2041-2050) and end-century (2091-2100). From the WRF/CCSM simulations, most basins are projected to have earlier peaks in springtime streamflow. The Columbia and the Lower Colorado watersheds are both expected to experience more extreme wet days, with the 99th percentile of daily precipitation estimated to increase by over 10%. For the Upper Colorado, however, the 99th percentile of daily runoff is projected to decrease by over 30%. Basins in the northern and central Sierra Nevada are projected to have substantial increases in extreme runoff, with doubling of high flow event magnitude possible for some basins. By end-century, the contribution of high-magnitude runoff (>90th percentile) to total runoff is projected to increase from 46 to 56%, when averaged across all 12 Sierra Nevada basins.

721,Evaluating the Forecast Skill of a Hydrometeorological Modelling System in Greece,"A hydrometeorological forecasting system has been operating at the Institute of Marine Biological Resources and Inland Waters (IMBRIW) of the Hellenic Centre for Marine Research (HCMR) since September 2015. The system consists of the Advanced Weather Research and Forecasting (WRF-ARW) model, the WRF-Hydro hydrological model, and the HEC-RAS hydraulic-hydrodynamic model. The system provides daily 120 h weather forecasts focusing on Greece (4 km horizontal resolution) and hydrological forecasts for the Spercheios and Evrotas rivers in Greece (100 m horizontal resolution), also providing flash flood inundation forecasts when needed (5 m horizontal resolution). The main aim of this study is to evaluate precipitation forecasts produced in a 4-year period (September 2015-August 2019) using measurements from meteorological stations across Greece. Water level forecasts for the Evrotas and Spercheios rivers were also evaluated using measurements from hydrological stations operated by the IMBRIW. Moreover, the forecast skill of the chained meteorological-hydrological-hydraulic operation of the system was investigated during a catastrophic flash flood in the Evrotas river. The results indicated that the system provided skillful precipitation and water level forecasts. The best evaluation results were yielded during rainy periods. They also demonstrated that timely flash flood forecasting products could benefit flood warning and emergency responses due to their efficiency and increased lead time.",https://doi.org/10.3390/atmos12070902,10.3390/atmos12070902,J,"Varlas, G; Papadopoulos, A; Papaioannou, G; Dimitriou, E",NA,NA,NA,"Varlas, George; Papadopoulos, Anastasios; Papaioannou, George; Dimitriou, Elias",NA,NA,y,ATMOSPHERE,NA,NA,English,Article,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,WRF-ARW; WRF-Hydro; HEC-RAS; numerical weather prediction; hydrometeorology; statistical evaluation; Spercheios and Evrotas rivers; flash floods,FLOOD ALERT SYSTEM; FLASH-FLOOD; CONVECTIVE PRECIPITATION; IMPLEMENTATION; ASSIMILATION; SENSITIVITY; RESOLUTION; RAINFALL; EVENTS; IMPACT,"[Varlas, George; Papadopoulos, Anastasios; Papaioannou, George; Dimitriou, Elias] Hellen Ctr Marine Res, Inst Marine Biol Resources & Inland Waters, Attica 19013, Greece",NA,"Varlas, G (corresponding author), Hellen Ctr Marine Res, Inst Marine Biol Resources & Inland Waters, Attica 19013, Greece.",gvarlas@hcmr.gr; tpapa@hcmr.gr; gpapaioan@hcmr.gr; elias@hcmr.gr,"Papadopoulos, Anastasios/L-6578-2013; Varlas, George/L-8082-2019; Papaioannou, George/K-2683-2019; Dimitriou, Elias/H-4237-2011","Papadopoulos, Anastasios/0000-0002-4441-3443; Varlas, George/0000-0001-7929-9452; Papaioannou, George/0000-0002-7389-6640; Dimitriou, Elias/0000-0001-6669-6897",Greek Research and Technology Network (GRNET) [PR007018/HYMETGRID-3],"Several of the calibration simulations of this work have been performed using computational time granted by the Greek Research and Technology Network (GRNET) in the National High-Performance Computer (HPC) facility ARIS (https://hpc.grnet.gr/(accessed on 12 July 2021)), under project PR007018/HYMETGRID-3.

722,WATER LEVEL PREDICTION AT TICH-BUI RIVER IN VIETNAM USING SUPPORT VECTOR REGRESSION,"In this paper, the support vector regression model is used to predict water levels at a downstream station of the Tich-Bui river basin. The study investigated the effects of rainfall data collected from eight gauging stations and water levels at the downstream station for the performance forecast. The model was set up to forecast water levels at the downstream station before 6-lead-hour, 12-lead-hour, 18-lead-hour and 24-lead-hour. Although the model does not require data on the climate, terrain but the forecast results are accurate. In the case of a water level forecast before 6 hours and 12 hours, the Nash coefficient gives a value of over 98.81% and the RMSE value is less than 0.20 m. This results suggest that the support vector regression model, which the authors use to accurately predict water levels in real time, can be used to warn of floods in Vietnam's rivers.",https://doi.org/NA,NA,C,"Nguyen, TT; Le, HTT",NA,NA,IEEE,"Thanh-Tung Nguyen; Le, Hien T.

723,Application study of IFAS and LSTM models on runoff simulation and flood prediction in the Tokachi River basin,"Floods are often caused by short-term heavy rainfall. An Integrated Flood Analysis System (IFAS) model is good at runoff simulation and a Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) model is good at learning massive data and realizing rainfall forecast. In this paper, the applicability of the IFAS model to runoff simulation in the Tokachi River basin and the LSTM model to forecast hourly rainfall was studied, and the accuracy of flood prediction was also studied by inputting the optimal rainfall data forecasted by the LSTM model into the IFAS model. The research results show that the IFAS model can accurately simulate the runoff process in the Tokachi River basin. In the calibration period and the verification period, the Nash-Sutcliffe efficiency coefficient (NSE) of all simulation results are above 0.75; the LSTM model can achieve forecast hourly rainfall with high precision, the NSE of best forecast results is 0.86; the IFAS model can achieve flood prediction with high precision by using the optimal rainfall data forecasted by the LSTM model, the NSE of simulation result is 0.81. The above conclusions show that it is of great significance to combine the hourly rainfall forecasted by the LSTM model with the IFAS model for flood prediction.",https://doi.org/10.2166/hydro.2021.035,10.2166/hydro.2021.035,J,"Chen, YC; Gao, JJ; Bin, ZH; Qian, JZ; Pei, RL; Zhu, H",NA,NA,NA,"Chen, Yue-Chao; Gao, Jia-Jia; Bin, Zhao-Hui; Qian, Jia-Zhong; Pei, Rui-Liang; Zhu, Hua",NA,NA,y,JOURNAL OF HYDROINFORMATICS,NA,NA,English,Article,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,flood prediction; IFAS model; LSTM model; rainfall and runoff simulation; Tokachi River basin,CATCHMENT; IMPACTS,"[Chen, Yue-Chao; Gao, Jia-Jia] Muroran Inst Technol, Grad Sch Engn, Muroran, Hokkaido 0508585, Japan; [Bin, Zhao-Hui; Zhu, Hua] Henan Inst Geol Sci, Zhengzhou 450013, Peoples R China; [Qian, Jia-Zhong] Hefei Univ Technol, Sch Resources & Environm Engn, Hefei 230009, Peoples R China; [Pei, Rui-Liang] Henan Inst Geol Survey, Zhengzhou 450001, Peoples R China",NA,"Bin, ZH (corresponding author), Henan Inst Geol Sci, Zhengzhou 450013, Peoples R China.",binzhaohui@163.com,NA,"Bin, Zhaohui/0000-0001-6637-6551","National Natural Science Foundation of ChinaNational Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC) [41831289, 41772250, 41877191]; Foundation of Key Scientific Research Projects of Henan Colleges and Universities [19A170008]; Key Laboratory of Mine Geological Hazards Mechanism and Control [KF2018-06]; Department of Land and Resources of Shaanxi Province Foundation [KF2018-06]","This study was supported by the National Natural Science Foundation of China (Grant Nos. 41831289, 41772250, and 41877191), the Foundation of Key Scientific Research Projects of Henan Colleges and Universities in 2019 (19A170008), and Key Laboratory of Mine Geological Hazards Mechanism and Control and Department of Land and Resources of Shaanxi Province Foundation (KF2018-06).",NA,24,0,0,12,14,IWA PUBLISHING,LONDON,"REPUBLIC-EXPORT BLDG, UNITS 1 04 & 1 05, 1 CLOVE CRESCENT, LONDON, ENGLAND",1464-7141,1465-1734,NA,J HYDROINFORM,J.

724,Resampling and ensemble techniques for improving ANN-based high-flow forecast accuracy,"Data-driven flow-forecasting models, such as artificial neural networks (ANNs), are increasingly featured in research for their potential use in operational riverine flood warning systems. However, the distributions of observed flow data are imbalanced, resulting in poor prediction accuracy on high flows in terms of both amplitude and timing error. Resampling and ensemble techniques have been shown to improve model performance on imbalanced datasets. However, the efficacy of these methods (individually or combined) has not been explicitly evaluated for improving high-flow forecasts. In this research, we systematically evaluate and compare three resampling methods, random undersampling (RUS), random oversampling (ROS), and the synthetic minority oversampling technique for regression (SMOTER), and four ensemble techniques, randomised weights and biases, bagging, adaptive boosting (Ad-aBoost), and least-squares boosting (LSBoost), on their ability to improve high stage prediction accuracy using ANNs. These methods are implemented both independently and in combined hybrid techniques, where the resampling methods are embedded within the ensemble methods. This systematic approach for embedding resampling methods is a novel contribution. This research presents the first analysis of the effects of combining these methods on high stage prediction accuracy. Data from two Canadian watersheds (the Bow River in Alberta and the Don River in Ontario), representing distinct hydrological systems, are used as the basis for the comparison of the methods. The models are evaluated on overall performance and on typical and high stage subsets. The results of this research indicate that resampling produces marginal improvements to high stage prediction accuracy, whereas ensemble methods produce more substantial improvements, with or without resampling. Many of the techniques used produced an asymmetric trade-off between typical and high stage performance; reduction of high stage error resulted in disproportionately larger error on a typical stage. The methods proposed in this study highlight the diversity-in-learning concept and help support future studies on adapting ensemble algorithms for resampling. This research contains many of the first instances of such methods for flow forecasting and, moreover, their efficacy in addressing the imbalance problem and heteroscedasticity, which are commonly observed in high-flow and flood-forecasting models.",https://doi.org/10.5194/hess-25-2543-2021,10.5194/hess-25-2543-2021,J,"Snieder, E; Abogadil, K; Khan, UT",NA,NA,NA,"Snieder, Everett; Abogadil, Karen; Khan, Usman T.",NA,NA,y,HYDROLOGY AND EARTH SYSTEM SCIENCES,NA,NA,English,Article,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,ARTIFICIAL NEURAL-NETWORKS; PREDICTION; MODELS; EFFICIENCY; SELECTION; ERROR; ADABOOST.RT; PERFORMANCE; VARIABLES; BASINS,"[Snieder, Everett; Abogadil, Karen; Khan, Usman T.] York Univ, Dept Civil Engn, 4700 Keele St, Toronto, ON M3J 1P3, Canada",NA,"Khan, UT (corresponding author), York Univ, Dept Civil Engn, 4700 Keele St, Toronto, ON M3J 1P3, Canada.",usman.khan@lassonde.yorku.ca,NA,"Snieder, Everett/0000-0003-4997-3404",Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of CanadaNatural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada (NSERC)CGIAR [RGPIN-2017-05661],This research has been supported by the Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada (grant no.

725,Correcting Satellite Precipitation Data and Assimilating Satellite-Derived Soil Moisture Data to Generate Ensemble Hydrological Forecasts within the HBV Rainfall-Runoff Model,"An implementation of bias correction and data assimilation using the ensemble Kalman filter (EnKF) as a procedure, dynamically coupled with the conceptual rainfall-runoff Hydrologiska Byrans Vattenbalansavdelning (HBV) model, was assessed for the hydrological modeling of seasonal hydrographs. The enhanced HBV model generated ensemble hydrographs and an average stream-flow simulation. The proposed approach was developed to examine the possibility of using data (e.g., precipitation and soil moisture) from the European Organisation for the Exploitation of Meteorological Satellites (EUMETSAT) Satellite Application Facility for Support to Operational Hydrology and Water Management (H-SAF), and to explore its usefulness in improving model updating and forecasting. Data from the Sola mountain catchment in southern Poland between 1 January 2008 and 31 July 2014 were used to calibrate the HBV model, while data from 1 August 2014 to 30 April 2015 were used for validation. A bias correction algorithm for a distribution-derived transformation method was developed by exploring generalized exponential (GE) theoretical distributions, along with gamma (GA) and Weibull (WE) distributions for the different data used in this study. When using the ensemble Kalman filter, the stochastically-generated ensemble of the model states generally induced bias in the estimation of non-linear hydrologic processes, thus influencing the accuracy of the Kalman analysis. In order to reduce the bias produced by the assimilation procedure, a post-processing bias correction (BC) procedure was coupled with the ensemble Kalman filter (EnKF), resulting in an ensemble Kalman filter with bias correction (EnKF-BC). The EnKF-BC, dynamically coupled with the HBV model for the assimilation of the satellite soil moisture observations, improved the accuracy of the simulated hydrographs significantly in the summer season, whereas, a positive effect from bias corrected (BC) satellite precipitation, as forcing data, was observed in the winter. Ensemble forecasts generated from the assimilation procedure are shown to be less uncertain. In future studies, the EnKF-BC algorithm proposed in the current study could be applied to a diverse array of practical forecasting problems (e.g., an operational assimilation of snowpack and snow water equivalent in forecasting models).",https://doi.org/10.3390/w11102138,10.3390/w11102138,J,"Ciupak, M; Ozga-Zielinski, B; Adamowski, J; Deo, RC; Kochanek, K",NA,NA,NA,"Ciupak, Maurycy; Ozga-Zielinski, Bogdan; Adamowski, Jan; Deo, Ravinesh C.; Kochanek, Krzysztof",NA,NA,y,WATER,NA,NA,English,Article,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,distribution derived transformation; ensemble Kalman filter coupled with bias correction; precipitation and root zone soil moisture index; H-SAF products,BIAS CORRECTION; KALMAN FILTER; TECHNICAL NOTE; PREDICTION; IMPACT; FLOOD; SIMULATION; STATE,"[Ciupak, Maurycy] Natl Res Inst, Inst Meteorol & Water Management, Hydrol Dept, Ul Podlesna 61, PL-01673 Warsaw, Poland; [Ozga-Zielinski, Bogdan] Natl Res Inst, Inst Meteorol & Water Management, Water Management & Engn Syst Dept, Ul Podlesna 61, PL-01673 Warsaw, Poland; [Adamowski, Jan] McGill Univ, Dept Bioresource Engn, 21 111 Lakeshore, Ste Anne de Bellevue, PQ H9X 3V9, Canada; [Deo, Ravinesh C.] Univ Southern Queensland, Inst Agr & Environm, Sch Agr Computat & Environm Sci, Toowoomba, Qld 01673, Australia; [Kochanek, Krzysztof] Polish Acad Sci, Inst Geophys, Ulica Ksiecia Janusza 64, PL-01452 Warsaw, Poland",NA,"Adamowski, J (corresponding author), McGill Univ, Dept Bioresource Engn, 21 111 Lakeshore, Ste Anne de Bellevue, PQ H9X 3V9, Canada.",Maurycy.Ciupak@imgw.pl; Bogdan.Ozga-Zielinski@imgw.pl; jan.adamowski@mcgill.ca; ravinesh.deo@usq.edu.au; kochanek@igf.edu.pl,"Deo, Ravinesh/F-6157-2012; Ozga-Zielinski, Bogdan/G-4447-2014","Deo, Ravinesh/0000-0002-2290-6749; Ozga-Zielinski, Bogdan/0000-0002-8702-3541",NSERC Discovery and Accelerate Grant,This research was partially funded by an NSERC Discovery and Accelerate Grant held by J.A.,NA,66,5,5,2,6,MDPI,BASEL,"ST ALBAN-ANLAGE 66, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND",NA,2073-4441,NA,WATER-SUI,Water,OCT,2019,11,10,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,2138,10.3390/w11102138,NA,NA,31,Environmental Sciences; Water Resources,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),Environmental Sciences & Ecology; Water Resources,JL5VD,WOS:000495598400182,NA,"Green Accepted, gold",NA,NA,2/17/2022
726,"Artificial intelligence application in drought assessment, monitoring and forecasting: a review","Drought is a natural hazard creating havoc on economic, social and environmental aspects. As a result of its slow and creeping nature, it is problematic to establish the onset as well as the termination of drought. Irrespective of its spatial and temporal variability, drought occurs in almost all regions. A wide range of drought studies has been conducted by many researchers over a long period of time. The damage caused by drought has a huge impact on the social, economic and agricultural sectors. Researchers have defined drought in different ways depending upon the parameters and its characteristics, and universally there is no proper definition for drought because of its complexity in nature. This review is focused mainly on various Artificial Intelligence techniques used in drought assessment, monitoring, management and forecasting. The findings from the study shows that drought prediction has become significance in the field of hydrology, Water Resources Management, sustainable agriculture, etc. by using the various AI techniques. In recent studies, AI has been used widely in analysing drought in different regions. The applications of AI techniques in the domain of drought assessing, monitoring, forecasting, etc., shows a rapid growth and that the impact of these will be increasing in future. For understanding the different concepts of drought study, it is needed to establish different system of drought management in order to monitor the different factors affecting drought and then take proper measures to mitigate the damage. Literature studies have been done to analyze the onset and other measures of drought management. Future research may be oriented towards Modeling and probabilistic analysis of climatic data for refining the drought vulnerability mapping, analysis of onset and termination, warning system and drought declaration process depending on the conditions of the region.",https://doi.org/10.1007/s00477-021-02129-3,10.1007/s00477-021-02129-3,J,"Kikon, A; Deka, PC",NA,NA,NA,"Kikon, Ayilobeni; Deka, Paresh Chandra",NA,NA,y,STOCHASTIC ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH AND RISK ASSESSMENT,NA,NA,English,Review; Early Access,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,Drought; Assessment; Monitoring; Management; Forecasting; Artificial intelligence techniques,EXTREME LEARNING-MACHINE; FUZZY INFERENCE SYSTEM; CLIMATE-CHANGE SCENARIOS; AWASH RIVER-BASIN; STANDARDIZED PRECIPITATION; METEOROLOGICAL DROUGHT; NEURAL-NETWORK; MODEL; PREDICTION; INDEX,"[Kikon, Ayilobeni; Deka, Paresh Chandra] Natl Inst Technol, Dept Water Resources & Ocean Engn, Surathkal, Karnataka, India",NA,"Kikon, A (corresponding author), Natl Inst Technol, Dept Water Resources & Ocean Engn, Surathkal, Karnataka, India.",ayilobeni@gmail.com,NA,"Kikon, Ayilobeni/0000-0003-4821-1037",NA,NA,NA,90,0,0,19,19,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"ONE NEW YORK PLAZA, SUITE 4600, NEW YORK, NY, UNITED STATES",1436-3240,1436-3259,NA,STOCH ENV RES RISK A,Stoch.

727,Dongting Lake Water Level Forecast and Its Relationship with the Three Gorges Dam Based on a Long Short-Term Memory Network,"To study the Dongting Lake water level variation and its relationship with the upstream Three Gorges Dam (TGD), a deep learning method based on a Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) network is used to establish a model that predicts the daily water levels of Dongting Lake. Seven factors are used as the input for the LSTM model and eight years of daily data (from 2003 to 2012) are used to train the model. Then, the model is applied to the test dataset (from 2011 to 2013) for forecasting and is evaluated using the root mean squared error (RMSE) and the coefficient of determination (R-2). The test shows the LSTM model has better accuracy compared to the support vector machine (SVM) model. Furthermore, the model is adjusted to simulate the situation where the TGD does not exist to explore the dam's impact. The experiment shows that the water level of Dongting Lake drops conspicuously every year from September to November during the TGD impounding period, and the water level increases mildly during dry seasons due to TGD replenishment. Additionally, the impact of the TGD results in a water level decline in Dongting Lake during flood peaks and a subsequent lagged rise.

728,Contribution of Meteorological Downscaling to Skill and Precision of Seasonal Drought Forecasts,"Research in meteorological prediction on subseasonal to seasonal (S2S) time scales has seen growth in recent years. Concurrent with this growth, demand for seasonal drought forecasting has risen. While there is obvious synergy between these fields, S2S meteorological forecasting has typically focused on low-resolution global models, whereas the development of drought can be sensitive to the local expression of weather anomalies and their interaction with local surface properties and processes. This suggests that downscaling might play an important role in the application of meteorological S2S forecasts to skillful forecasting of drought. Here, we apply the generalized analog regression downscaling (GARD) algorithm to downscale meteorological hindcasts from the NASA Goddard Earth Observing System global S2S forecast system. Downscaled meteorological fields are then applied to drive offline simulations with the Catchment Land Surface Model to forecast U.S. Drought Monitor-style drought indicators derived from simulated surface hydrology variables. We compare the representation of drought in these downscaled hindcasts with hindcasts that are not downscaled, using the North American Land Data Assimilation System Phase 2 (NLDAS-2) dataset as an observational reference. We find that downscaling using GARD improves hindcasts of temperature and temperature anomalies but that the results for precipitation are mixed and generally small. Overall, GARD downscaling led to improved hindcast skill for total drought across the contiguous United States, and improvements were greatest for extreme (D3) and exceptional (D4) drought categories.",https://doi.org/10.1175/JHM-D-20-0259.1,10.1175/JHM-D-20-0259.1,J,"Zamora, RA; Zaitchik, BF; Rodell, M; Getirana, A; Kumar, S; Arsenault, K; Gutmann, E",NA,NA,NA,"Zamora, Ryan A.; Zaitchik, Benjamin F.; Rodell, Matthew; Getirana, Augusto; Kumar, Sujay; Arsenault, Kristi; Gutmann, Ethan",NA,NA,y,JOURNAL OF HYDROMETEOROLOGY,NA,NA,English,Article,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,Drought; Seasonal forecasting; Land surface model,DATA ASSIMILATION; PREDICTION; RESOLUTION; SYSTEM; INITIALIZATION; GROUNDWATER; FORCINGS; IMPACTS,"[Zamora, Ryan A.; Zaitchik, Benjamin F.] Johns Hopkins Univ, Baltimore, MD 21218 USA; [Rodell, Matthew; Getirana, Augusto; Kumar, Sujay; Arsenault, Kristi] NASA, Hydrol Sci Lab, Goddard Space Flight Ctr, Greenbelt, MD USA; [Arsenault, Kristi] Sci Applicat Int Corp, Mclean, VA USA; [Gutmann, Ethan] Natl Ctr Atmospher Res, POB 3000, Boulder, CO 80307 USA",NA,"Zamora, RA (corresponding author), Johns Hopkins Univ, Baltimore, MD 21218 USA.",ryan.zamora@jhu.edu,NA,NA,NASA's Applied Sciences Program-Water Resources Award [13-WATER13-0030]; National Science FoundationNational Science Foundation (NSF); GRACE and GRACE Follow On Science Team,This study was funded by NASA'sApplied Sciences Program-Water Resources Award 13-WATER13-0030 and the GRACE and GRACE Follow On Science Team.

729,"When the river talks to its people: Local knowledge-based flood forecasting in Gandak River basin, India","Local knowledge on flood forecasting and meteorological phenomenon have received scant research attention in South Asia. While local communities are often recognised as key producers of knowledge on adaptation and resilience, their role as producers of knowledge of meteorology and flood forecasting has drawn lesser interest than their consumption of it as end users. Moreover, the opinion that has carried through to limited research on this issue has been largely that of men. This paper attempts to address such a research gap, by recording various sophisticated means deployed by local communities living in villages in transboundary Gandak River basin in Bihar, India, to forecast floods and heavy rainfall. This research documents the gendered process by which local knowledge is produced through complex interaction between fine-grained observations and official early warning systems. It also explores how communities practice knowledge innovation by making generic and centralized flood forecasting information locally applicable, through triangulation. Our research argues that 'local' should not be recognised purely for dissemination of flood early warning information but also as a place of knowledge generation on flood forecasting. Current discourse on flood forecasting needs to recognize the gendered production of meteorological and flood forecasting knowledge in local communities. Furthermore, strengthening local knowledge systems on flood forecasting can work to counterbalance the drawbacks of centralized flood early warning systems, provided gender concerns embedded in both are recognised. Based on field research, this paper concludes that production and consumption of flood forecasting knowledge needs local and scientific communities to work together for reducing knowledge gaps at both ends.",https://doi.org/10.1016/j.envdev.2018.12.003,10.1016/j.envdev.2018.12.003,J,"Acharya, A; Prakash, A",NA,NA,NA,"Acharya, Amitangshu; Prakash, Anjal",NA,NA,y,ENVIRONMENTAL DEVELOPMENT,NA,NA,English,Article,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,Flood forecasting; Early warning; Local knowledge; Gender; Transboundary water; Gandak River; Bihar; India,INDIGENOUS KNOWLEDGE; WARNING SYSTEMS; MANAGEMENT; PERCEPTION; RESOURCE; RISK,"[Acharya, Amitangshu] Univ Edinburgh, Res Inst Geog & Lived Environm, Sch GeoSci, Edinburgh, Midlothian, Scotland; [Prakash, Anjal] Int Ctr Integrated Mt Dev ICIMOD, HI AWARE, Kathmandu, Nepal",NA,"Acharya, A (corresponding author), Univ Edinburgh, Res Inst Geog & Lived Environm, Sch GeoSci, Edinburgh, Midlothian, Scotland.",amitangshu.acharya@ed.ac.uk,NA,"Acharya, Amitangshu/0000-0003-2333-7936","International Development Research Centre (IDRC), Ottawa, Canada; IDRC [107641]; government of Afghanistan; government of Australia; government of Austria; government of Bangladesh; government of Bhutan; government of China; government of India; government of Myanmar; government of Nepal; government of Norway; government of Pakistan; government of Switzerland; government of United Kingdom","This work was carried out by the Himalayan Adaptation, Water and Resilience (HI-AWARE) consortium under the Collaborative Adaptation Research Initiative in Africa and Asia (CARIAA) with financial support from International Development Research Centre (IDRC), Ottawa, Canada.

730,Comparison of ensemble models for drought prediction based on climate indexes,"Current drought studies have already used the concept of equal ensemble streamflow prediction, but lack other kinds of ensemble prediction models for comparison of drought probabilistic prediction. Therefore, in this paper, an equal ensemble drought prediction (EEDP) model, a weighted ensemble drought prediction (WEDP) model, and a conditional ensemble drought prediction (CEDP) model were established and elaborately compared for drought prediction. The EEDP model directly uses the concept of ensemble streamflow prediction and assigns an equal weight to each ensemble member. The WEDP model assigns weights to ensemble members given the similarity of climate indexes between the historical and forecast year. The CEDP model considers the climate information as predictors and generates conditional ensembles of drought given the climate indexes. The verification of the proposed models was carried out using 26 meteorological stations in Jiangxi province (China), using the standard precipitation index to depict meteorological drought conditions in October, November, and December. The results show that compared to the EEDP model, the WEDP and CEDP models remarkably improved the accuracy and reduced the uncertainty of the drought prediction, indicating that a model considering climate information is much better than a purely statistical model. Meanwhile, the CEDP model outperformed the WEDP model in parameter estimation and accuracy. The prediction in southern Jiangxi province gets the best results compared with other regions. Our results provide a basis for drought planning and management in Jiangxi province.",https://doi.org/10.1007/s00477-019-01650-w,10.1007/s00477-019-01650-w,J,"Zhang, X; Dong, QJ; Chen, J",NA,NA,NA,"Zhang, Xu; Dong, Qianjin; Chen, Jie",NA,NA,y,STOCHASTIC ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH AND RISK ASSESSMENT,NA,NA,English,Article,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,Ensemble drought prediction; The standardized precipitation index; Copula function; Climate indexes,FLOOD FREQUENCY; POYANG LAKE; RIVER-BASIN; NEURAL-NETWORK; YANGTZE-RIVER; STREAMFLOW; COPULA; TELECONNECTIONS; VARIABILITY; FORECASTS,"[Zhang, Xu; Dong, Qianjin; Chen, Jie] Wuhan Univ, State Key Lab Water Resources & Hydropower Engn S, Wuhan 430072, Hubei, Peoples R China; [Dong, Qianjin; Chen, Jie] Wuhan Univ, Res Inst Water Secur, Wuhan 430072, Hubei, Peoples R China",NA,"Dong, QJ (corresponding author), Wuhan Univ, State Key Lab Water Resources & Hydropower Engn S, Wuhan 430072, Hubei, Peoples R China.; Dong, QJ (corresponding author), Wuhan Univ, Res Inst Water Secur, Wuhan 430072, Hubei, Peoples R China.",dqjin@whu.edu.cn,NA,"Zhang, Xu/0000-0002-0957-3636","National Key R&D Program of China [2016YFC0402708, 2017YFA0603704]; National Nature Science Foundation of ChinaNational Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC) [51439007, 91647119]; Innovation group of Hubei Natural Science Foundation [2017CFA015]","This research is financially supported by the National Key R&D Program of China (Grant Nos. 2016YFC0402708, 2017YFA0603704), National Nature Science Foundation of China (Grant Nos. 51439007, 91647119), and Innovation group of Hubei Natural Science Foundation (Grant No. 2017CFA015).

731,Event-based nonpoint source pollution prediction in a scarce data catchment,"Quantifying the rainfall-runoff-pollutant (R-R-P) process is key to regulating non-point source (NPS) pollution; however, the impacts of scarce measured data on R-R-P simulations have not yet been reported. In this study, we conducted a comprehensive study of scarce data that addressed both rainfall-runoff and runoff-pollutant processes, whereby the impacts of data scarcity on two commonly used methods, including Unit Hydrograph (UH) and Loads Estimator (LOADEST), were quantified. A case study was performed in a typical small catchment of the Three Gorges Reservoir Region (TGRR) of China. Based on our results, the classification of rainfall patterns should be carried out first when analyzing modeling results. Compared to data based on a missing rate and a missing location, key information generates more impacts on the simulated flow and NPS loads. When the scarcity rate exceeds a certain threshold (20% in this study), measured data scarcity level has clear impacts on the model's accuracy. As the model of total nitrogen (TN) always performs better under different data scarcity conditions, researchers are encouraged to pay more attention to continuous the monitoring of total phosphorus (TP) for better NPS-TP predictions. The results of this study serve as baseline information for hydrologic forecasting and for the further control of NPS pollutants. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V.

732,Assessment of Advanced LiDAR Based Tools for Enhanced Flood Prediction,"Extreme rainfall events have become more frequent and more intense in recent times, leading to increased severe flooding. Potential impacts, especially to transportation infrastructure such as roads and bridges, are magnified due to their age. Also, transportation infrastructure experiences strain to keep up with increasing land development, which causes more flow into streams. To mitigate the resulting impacts of bridge overtopping and roadway washouts on the public, a software tool is proposed that contributes to decision making in disaster response for extreme rainfall events. To create the software tool, an accurate, high resolution surface terrain model (including channels, roadways, and infrastructure for bridges and culverts) is produced of the selected study area using QL2 LiDAR data sets. Additionally, stormwater flow models are generated for flow at stream and bridge intersections, and through culverts at various storm return periods. The resulting software tool will integrate bridge overtopping and roadway washout location identification to show the severity of impact for selected watersheds in near real time. This tool will be in the form of open source software (e.g., Python) and an interactive map to display the locations and levels of severity based on forecasted rain data input for the study area. The paper first presents the proposed method, details the data collection and processing techniques, and then discusses a case study.

733,Methods used for quantifying the prediction uncertainty of artificial neural network based hydrologic models,"Application of artificial neural network (ANN) models has been reported to solve variety of water resources and environmental related problems including prediction, forecasting and classification, over the last two decades. Though numerous research studies have witnessed the improved estimate of ANN models, the practical applications are sometimes limited. The black box nature of ANN models and their parameters hardly convey the physical meaning of catchment characteristics, which result in lack of transparency. In addition, it is perceived that the point prediction provided by ANN models does not explain any information about the prediction uncertainty, which reduce the reliability. Thus, there is an increasing consensus among researchers for developing methods to quantify the uncertainty of ANN models, and a comprehensive evaluation of uncertainty methods applied in ANN models is an emerging field that calls for further improvements. In this paper, methods used for quantifying the prediction uncertainty of ANN based hydrologic models are reviewed based on the research articles published from the year 2002 to 2015, which focused on modeling streamflow forecast/prediction. While the flood forecasting along with uncertainty quantification has been frequently reported in applications other than ANN in the literature, the uncertainty quantification in ANN model is a recent progress in the field, emerged from the year 2002. Based on the review, it is found that methods for best way of incorporating various aspects of uncertainty in ANN modeling require further investigation. Though model inputs, parameters and structure uncertainty are mainly considered as the source of uncertainty, information of their mutual interaction is still lacking while estimating the total prediction uncertainty. The network topology including number of layers, nodes, activation function and training algorithm has often been optimized for the model accuracy, however not in terms of model uncertainty. Finally, the effective use of various uncertainty evaluation indices should be encouraged for the meaningful quantification of uncertainty. This review article also discusses the effectiveness and drawbacks of each method and suggests recommendations for further improvement.",https://doi.org/10.1007/s00477-016-1369-5,10.1007/s00477-016-1369-5,J,"Kasiviswanathan, KS; Sudheer, KP",NA,NA,NA,"Kasiviswanathan, K.

734,Study on turbidity prediction method of reservoirs based on long short term memory neural network,"Turbidity is one of the important indicators in water quality management of reservoir. There are many factors affecting turbidity, and its time series is non-linear, making prediction difficult. Therefore, it is necessary to carry out research on reservoir turbidity prediction methods. In this study, the Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) neural network was identified, validated and tested for the computation of turbidity in the Qingcaosha Reservoir. The model employed historical data of turbidity, water level, wind direction and wind speed over a period of 2 years at various monitoring points. Within 40 iterations of the model, the mean square error converged to less than 0.05 steadily, and the Nash efficiency coefficient of the 24 h prediction was above 0.5. It showed that the model has the characteristics of fast convergence, high stability, and accurate prediction, which meant this model can be well applied to prediction of reservoir turbidity. This study also tried to use the forecasted wind field data to improve the actual turbidity prediction of the reservoir. The results showed that the accuracy is slightly lower than the predicted result using the measured wind field data, but it was significantly higher than the prediction result using the extended wind field data at the previous time point. Therefore, using forecasted wind field data can effectively improve the accuracy of the actual reservoir turbidity forecast. The results of this study indicate that the LSTM neural network model is fast, stable, and highly accurate, indicating that it is suitable for prediction of turbidity in reservoirs and can provide support for water quality management of reservoirs.",https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ecolmodel.2020.109210,10.1016/j.ecolmodel.2020.109210,J,"Song, CY; Zhang, HP",NA,NA,NA,"Song, Chenyu; Zhang, Haiping",NA,NA,y,ECOLOGICAL MODELLING,NA,NA,English,Article,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,Turbidity prediction; LSTM; Neural network; Time series; Wind field,LSTM; MODEL,"[Song, Chenyu; Zhang, Haiping] Tongji Univ, Shanghai 200092, Peoples R China",NA,"Zhang, HP (corresponding author), Tongji Univ, Shanghai 200092, Peoples R China.",hpzhang@tongji.edu.cn,NA,NA,Major Science and Technology Program for Water Pollution Control and Treatment [2017ZX07207003-02]; Ministry of Housing and Urban-Rural Development of the People's of China,This research was supported by the Major Science and Technology Program for Water Pollution Control and Treatment (No. 2017ZX07207003-02) funded by Ministry of Housing and Urban-Rural Development of the People's of China.

735,"Hybrid MARMA-NARX model for flow forecasting based on the large-scale climate signals, sea-surface temperatures, and rainfall","In this study, to reflect the effect of large-scale climate signals on runoff, these indices are accompanied with rainfall (the most effective local factor in runoff) as the inputs of the hybrid model. Where one-year in advance forecasting of reservoir inflows can provide data to have an optimal reservoir operation, reports show we still need more accurate models which include all effective parameters to have more forecasting accuracy than traditional linear models (ARMA and ARIMA). Thus, hybridization of models was employed for improving the accuracy of flow forecasting. Moreover, various forecasters including large-scale climate signals were tested to promote forecasting. This paper focuses on testing MARMA-NARX hybrid model to enhance the accuracy of monthly inflow forecasts. Since the inflow in different periods of the year has in linear and non-linear trends, the hybrid model is proposed as a means of combining linear model, monthly autoregressive moving average (MARMA), and non-linear model, nonlinear autoregressive model with exogenous (NARX) inputs to upgrade the accuracy of flow forecasting.

736,"Predicting mine water inflow and groundwater levels for coal mining operations in the Pangpangta coalfield, China","Coal and water resources have played important roles in China's social and economic development. Thus, accurate and reliable predictions of coal mine water inflow and aquifer water level variations are required to ensure mining safety and assess the impact of coal mining on groundwater aquifers. A three-dimensional numerical model was established for unsteady groundwater flows based on a conceptual hydrogeologic model. The numerical simulation predicted mine water inflow via repeated parameter adjustments and model identification and verification, and the simulated water inflow values were compared with the water inflow values predicted by the hydrogeological analytical method. Similarly, the numerical simulation also forecasted the changes in the water levels of the phreatic and karst fissure aquifers. The numerical simulation predicted greater water inflow than that determined by the big well method for the 5th coal seam of Panel 1, whereas the opposite results were obtained for the water inflow estimates for the coal seams in the other two panels. The calculated combined mine water inflows for the three mined panels were 14940m(3)/day and 14774m(3)/day using the big well method and the numerical simulation, respectively. A comparative analysis of the water levels in different periods showed that the water levels slightly decreased for both the mined and unmined cases, and the maximum variation differences between the unmined and mined cases were 1.39 and 2.72m in the phreatic aquifer and karst fissure aquifer, respectively. The maximum water level decrease occurred in the northeast area of the coalfield. Based on this work, such results can be used by decision maker to improve mine safety and protect water resources.",https://doi.org/10.1007/s12665-019-8098-2,10.1007/s12665-019-8098-2,J,"Wu, C; Wu, X; Zhu, G; Qian, C",NA,NA,NA,"Wu, Chu; Wu, Xiong; Zhu, Ge; Qian, Cheng",NA,NA,y,ENVIRONMENTAL EARTH SCIENCES,NA,NA,English,Article,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,Numerical simulation; Big well method; Aquifer effect; Mine exploitation,SIMULATION; AQUIFERS; KAILUAN; IMPACT; MODEL; FLOW,"[Wu, Chu; Wu, Xiong; Zhu, Ge; Qian, Cheng] China Univ Geosci, Sch Water Resources & Environm, Beijing 100083, Peoples R China",NA,"Wu, X (corresponding author), China Univ Geosci, Sch Water Resources & Environm, Beijing 100083, Peoples R China.",wuxiong@cugb.edu.cn,NA,NA,Ministry of Land and Resources of China [201511056-3]; National Natural Science Foundation of ChinaNational Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC) [41572227]; Department of Land and Resources of Anhui Province [2016-k-10],"This study was supported by a project supported by the Ministry of Land and Resources of China (201511056-3), the National Natural Science Foundation of China (no. 41572227) and a project supported by Department of Land and Resources of Anhui Province (2016-k-10).",NA,33,5,5,12,61,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"233 SPRING ST, NEW YORK, NY 10013 USA",1866-6280,1866-6299,NA,ENVIRON EARTH SCI,Environ.

737,Water quality assessment of a river using deep learning Bi-LSTM methodology: forecasting and validation,"Water is a prime necessity for the survival and sustenance of all living beings. Over the past few years, the water quality of rivers is adversely affected due to harmful wastes and pollutants. This ever-increasing water pollution is a big matter of concern as it deteriorating the water quality, making it unfit for any type of use. Recently, water quality modelling using machine learning techniques has generated a lot of interest and can be very beneficial in ecological and water resources management. However, they suffer many times from high computational complexity and high prediction error. The good performance of a deep neural network like long short-term memory network (LSTM) has been exploited for the time-series data. In this paper, a deep learning-based Bi-LSTM model (DLBL-WQA) is introduced to forecast the water quality factors of Yamuna River, India. The existing schemes do not perform missing value imputation and focus only on the learning process without including a loss function pertaining to training error. The proposed model shows a novel scheme which includes missing value imputation in the first phase, the second phase generates the feature maps from the given input data, the third phase includes a Bi-LSTM architecture to improve the learning process, and finally, an optimized loss function is applied to reduce the training error. Thus, the proposed model improves forecasting accuracy. Data comprising monthly samples of different water quality factors were collected for 6 years (2013-2019) at several locations in the Delhi region. Experimental results reveal that predicted values of the model and the actual values were in a close agreement and could reveal a future trend. The performance of our model was compared with various state of the art techniques like SVR, random forest, artificial neural network, LSTM, and CNN-LSTM. To check the accuracy, metrics like root mean square errors (RMSE), the mean absolute error (MAE), mean square error (MSE), and mean absolute percentage error (MAPE) have been used. Experimental analysis is carried out by measuring the COD and BOD levels. COD analysis reveals the MSE, RMSE, MAE, and MAPE values as 0.015, 0.117, 0.115, and 20.32, respectively, for the Palla region. Similarly, BOD analysis indicates the MSE, RMSE, MAE, and MAPE values as 0.107, 0.108, 0.124, and 18.22, respectively. A comparative analysis reveals that the proposed model outperforms all other models in terms of the best forecasting accuracy and lowest error rates.",https://doi.org/10.1007/s11356-021-13875-w,10.1007/s11356-021-13875-w,J,"Khullar, S; Singh, N",NA,NA,NA,"Khullar, Sakshi; Singh, Nanhey",NA,NA,y,ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE AND POLLUTION RESEARCH,NA,NA,English,Article,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,Water quality prediction; Deep learning; CNN; Bi-LSTM; Yamuna river,PREDICTION; MODELS; MACHINE,"[Khullar, Sakshi] Guru Gobind Singh Indraprastha Univ, New Delhi 110008, India; [Singh, Nanhey] AIACTR, GGSIPU, CSE, Krishna Nagar Rd Chacha Nahru Bal Chikitsalaya, New Delhi 110031, India",NA,"Khullar, S (corresponding author), Guru Gobind Singh Indraprastha Univ, New Delhi 110008, India.",sakshikhullar2809@gmail.com; nsingh1973@gmail.com,NA,"Singh, Prof.Nanhay/0000-0002-3303-1386",NA,NA,NA,31,2,2,22,52,SPRINGER HEIDELBERG,HEIDELBERG,"TIERGARTENSTRASSE 17, D-69121 HEIDELBERG, GERMANY",0944-1344,1614-7499,NA,ENVIRON SCI POLLUT R,Environ.

738,"Short Term Real-Time Rolling Forecast of Urban River Water Levels Based on LSTM: A Case Study in Fuzhou City, China","Water level management is an important part of urban water system management. In flood season, the river should be controlled to ensure the ecological and landscape water level. In non-flood season, the water level should be lowered to ensure smooth drainage. In urban areas, the response of the river water level to rainfall and artificial regulation is relatively rapid and strong. Therefore, building a mathematical model to forecast the short-term trend of urban river water levels can provide a scientific basis for decision makers and is of great significance for the management of urban water systems. With a focus on the high uncertainty of urban river water level prediction, a real-time rolling forecast method for the short-term water levels of urban internal rivers and external rivers was constructed, based on long short-term memory (LSTM). Fuzhou City, China was used as the research area, and the forecast performance of LSTM was analyzed. The results confirm the feasibility of LSTM in real-time rolling forecasting of water levels. The absolute errors at different times in each forecast were compared, and the various characteristics and causes of the errors in the forecast process were analyzed. The forecast performance of LSTM under different rolling intervals and different forecast periods was compared, and the recommended values are provided as a reference for the construction of local operational forecast systems.",https://doi.org/10.3390/ijerph18179287,10.3390/ijerph18179287,J,"Liu, Y; Wang, H; Feng, WW; Huang, HC",NA,NA,NA,"Liu, Yu; Wang, Hao; Feng, Wenwen; Huang, Haocheng",NA,NA,y,INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH AND PUBLIC HEALTH,NA,NA,English,Article,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,urban river management; water level forecasting; real-time rolling forecast; LSTM,MODEL; INTELLIGENCE; MEMORY,"[Liu, Yu; Wang, Hao] Beijing Univ Technol, Fac Architecture Civil & Transportat Engn, Beijing 100124, Peoples R China; [Feng, Wenwen] Changan Univ, Sch Water & Environm, Xian 710054, Peoples R China; [Huang, Haocheng] Cent South Univ, Sch Civil Engn, Changsha 410075, Peoples R China",NA,"Wang, H (corresponding author), Beijing Univ Technol, Fac Architecture Civil & Transportat Engn, Beijing 100124, Peoples R China.",liuyu@emails.bjut.edu.cn; wanghao87@bjut.edu.cn; fww@chd.edu.cn; hhccsu@csu.edu.cn,NA,NA,National Key R&D Program of China [2018YFC0407902],This work was funded by the National Key R&D Program of China (2018YFC0407902).,NA,36,2,2,19,19,MDPI,BASEL,"ST ALBAN-ANLAGE 66, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND",NA,1660-4601,NA,INT J ENV RES PUB HE,Int.

739,Coupling a hybrid CNN-LSTM deep learning model with a Boundary Corrected Maximal Overlap Discrete Wavelet Transform for multiscale Lake water level forecasting,"Developing accurate lake water level (WL) forecasting models is important for flood control, shoreline maintenance and sustainable water resources planning and management. In this study, improved accuracy of forecasts (up to three months) of Lake Michigan and Lake Ontario WLs was achieved by coupling Boundary Corrected (BC) Maximal Overlap Discrete Wavelet Transform (MODWT) data preprocessing, with a hybrid Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) Long-Short Term Memory (LSTM) deep learning (DL) model. Hybrid DL-based model performance was compared to that of BC-MODWT machine learning (ML) [e.g., Random Forest (RF) and Support Vector Regression (SVR)] models. For each lake, all models were calibrated using 70% of the monthly WL (in meters) data series (January 1918 to February 1988), with the remaining 30% (March 1988 to December 2018) serving for validation. In both standalone and wavelet-machine learning models, a hybrid correlation-based feature selection (CFS)-particle swarm optimization (PSO) search method served to select input variables among candidate WL lags of up to twelve months, whereas for the CNN-LSTM DL models, input variable selection was carried out automatically by the CNN structure. For the MODWT-based ML and DL models, input time series were decomposed using a BC-MODWT approach. Scaling coefficients were developed through several mother wavelet approaches (i.e., Haar, Daubechies, Symlets, Fejer-Korovkin and Coiflets) with different filter lengths (up to twelve) and decomposition levels (up to seven). Model performance was evaluated using several visual and statistical metrics, including the correlation coefficient, r; the root mean standard error, RMSE; and Willmot's Index, WI. The CNN-LSTM DL model outperformed the standalone SVR and RF models. For all time horizons, coupled MODWT-based CNN-LSTM models outperformed standalone and hybrid models in WL forecasting. Not all wavelet family/filter length/decomposition combinations improved standalone models; however, the proposed BC-MODWT-CNN-LSTM model implementing the Haar mother wavelet (for Lake Michigan - one-month ahead: r = 0.994, RMSE = 0.04 m, WI = 0.996; two-months ahead: r = 0.979, RMSE = 0.07 m, WI = 0.989; threemonths ahead: r = 0.957, RMSE = 0.102 m, WI = 0.976; for Lake Ontario - one-month ahead: r = 0.956, RMSE = 0.082 m, WI = 0.978; two-months ahead: r = 0.864, RMSE = 0.141, WI = 0.912; three-months ahead: r = 0.755, RMSE = 0.182 m, WI = 0.841) outperformed standalone ML and BC-MODWT-ML-based models. Accordingly, the BC-MODWT-CNN-LSTM model can be viewed as a potentially useful approach to increase the accuracy of lake WL forecasts.",https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jhydrol.2021.126196,10.1016/j.jhydrol.2021.126196,J,"Barzegar, R; Aalami, MT; Adamowski, J",NA,NA,NA,"Barzegar, Rahim; Aalami, Mohammad Taghi; Adamowski, Jan",NA,NA,y,JOURNAL OF HYDROLOGY,NA,NA,English,Article,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,Forecasting; Wavelet transform; Deep learning; Machine learning; Water level; Great Lakes,PARTICLE SWARM OPTIMIZATION; SUPPORT VECTOR MACHINE; NEURAL-NETWORK; FEATURE-SELECTION; RANDOM FOREST; TERM; REGRESSION; DECOMPOSITION; FLUCTUATIONS,"[Barzegar, Rahim; Aalami, Mohammad Taghi] Univ Tabriz, Fac Civil Engn, 29 Bahman Blvd, Tabriz 5166616471, Iran; [Barzegar, Rahim; Adamowski, Jan] McGill Univ, Dept Bioresource Engn, 21111 Lakeshore, Ste Anne De Bellevue, PQ H9X 3V9, Canada",NA,"Barzegar, R (corresponding author), Univ Tabriz, Fac Civil Engn, 29 Bahman Blvd, Tabriz 5166616471, Iran.",rm.barzegar@tabrizu.ac.ir,NA,NA,"University of Tabriz, Iran [5979]; NSERCNatural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada (NSERC)","The authors are thankful to the University of Tabriz, Iran for providing a Postdoctoral Research Grant (NO. 5979) to Rahim Barzegar.

740,Comparative Study of Elman Neural Network (ENN) and Neural Network Autoregressive With Exogenous Input (NARX) For Flood Forecasting,"Flood happen when a river ruptures its bank due to massive amount of water and the water spills out onto the land. Therefore, flood prediction system is necessary in order to alert the people about the incoming flood. Flood cannot be preventing but can take the precaution steps by using a precise technique to forecast the flood earlier. In this modern day, there are many models of flood prediction was introduced to the world. The accuracy of water level is very crucial for flood forecasting. By compare all the models, the most accurate technique can be discovered. In Malaysia, NARX and ENN are the flood prediction models that were frequently be used by researches. Thus, this paper proposed comparison between Elman Neural Network (ENN) and Neural Network Autoregressive with Exogenous Input (NARX) to specify which model are more accurate. Therefore, both of the model is using the same water level data which recorded in Kedah to ensure which model are more precise. Based on result obtain, Elman are more accurate than NARX since it have higher best fit and lower root mean square error (RMSE).",https://doi.org/NA,NA,C,"Zainorzuli, SM; Abdullah, SAC; Adnan, R; Ruslan, FA",NA,NA,IEEE,"Zainorzuli, Siti Maisarah; Abdullah, Syahrul Afzal Che; Adnan, Ramli; Ruslan, Fazlina Ahmat",NA,NA,y,2019 IEEE 9TH SYMPOSIUM ON COMPUTER APPLICATIONS & INDUSTRIAL ELECTRONICS (ISCAIE),NA,NA,English,Proceedings Paper,9th IEEE Symposium on Computer Applications and Industrial Electronics (ISCAIE),"APR 27-28, 2019","Kota Kinabalu, MALAYSIA","IEEE, IEEE Malaysia Ind Elect & Ind Applicat Soc Joint Chapter",NA,Elman Neural Network (ENN); Neural Network Autoregressive with Exogenous Input (NARX),NA,"[Zainorzuli, Siti Maisarah; Abdullah, Syahrul Afzal Che; Adnan, Ramli; Ruslan, Fazlina Ahmat] Univ Teknol MARA, Fac Elect Engn, Shah Alam 40450, Selangor, Malaysia",NA,"Ruslan, FA (corresponding author), Univ Teknol MARA, Fac Elect Engn, Shah Alam 40450, Selangor, Malaysia.",fazlina419@salam.uitm.edu.my,"Ruslan, Fazlina Ahmat/AAP-1443-2020; Adnan, Ramli/K-5264-2012","Ruslan, Fazlina Ahmat/0000-0002-6460-5418;",NA,NA,NA,11,3,3,0,3,IEEE,NEW YORK,"345 E 47TH ST, NEW YORK, NY 10017 USA",NA,NA,978-1-5386-8546-4,NA,NA,NA,2019,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,11,15,NA,NA,NA,NA,5,"Automation & Control Systems; Engineering, Electrical & Electronic; Operations Research & Management Science",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S),Automation & Control Systems; Engineering; Operations Research & Management Science,BN4NZ,WOS:000482564200003,NA,NA,NA,NA,2/17/2022

742,Untangling climate and water chemistry to predict changes in freshwater macrophyte distributions,"Forecasting changes in the distributions of macrophytes is essential to understanding how aquatic ecosystems will respond to climate and environmental changes. Previous work in aquatic ecosystems has used climate data at large scales and chemistry data at small scales; the consequence of using these different data types has not been evaluated. This study combines a survey of macrophyte diversity and water chemistry measurements at a large regional scale to demonstrate the feasibility and necessity of including ecological measurements, in addition to climate data, in species distribution models of aquatic macrophytes. A survey of 740 water bodies stratified across 327,000 square kilometers was conducted to document Characeae (green macroalgae) species occurrence and water chemistry data. Chemistry variables and climate data were used separately and in concert to develop species distribution models for ten species across the study area. The impacts of future environmental changes on species distributions were modeled using a range of global climate models (GCMs), representative concentration pathways (RCPs), and pollution scenarios. Models developed with chemistry variables generally gave the most accurate predictions of species distributions when compared with those using climate variables. Calcium and conductivity had the highest total relative contribution to models across all species. Habitat changes were most pronounced in scenarios with increased road salt and deicer influences, with two species predicted to increase in range by >50% and four species predicted to decrease in range by >50%. Species of Characeae have distinct habitat ranges that closely follow spatial patterns of water chemistry. Species distribution models built with climate data alone were insufficient to predict changes in distributions in the study area. The development and implementation of standardized, large-scale water chemistry databases will aid predictions of habitat changes for aquatic ecosystems.",https://doi.org/10.1002/ece3.3847,10.1002/ece3.3847,J,"Sleith, RS; Wehr, JD; Karol, KG",NA,NA,NA,"Sleith, Robin S.; Wehr, John D.; Karol, Kenneth G.",NA,NA,y,ECOLOGY AND EVOLUTION,NA,NA,English,Article,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,algae; calcium; Characeae; freshwater; macrophyte; water chemistry,NITELLOPSIS-OBTUSA CHAROPHYCEAE; SPECIES DISTRIBUTION MODELS; STONEWORTS CHARACEAE; AQUATIC MACROPHYTES; EUTROPHICATION; PROJECTIONS; DISCOVERY; RECORD; LAKE,"[Sleith, Robin S.; Karol, Kenneth G.] New York Bot Garden, Lewis B & Dorothy Cullman Program Mol Systemat, Bronx, NY 10458 USA; [Wehr, John D.] Fordham Univ, Dept Biol Sci, Bronx, NY 10458 USA",NA,"Sleith, RS (corresponding author), New York Bot Garden, Lewis B & Dorothy Cullman Program Mol Systemat, Bronx, NY 10458 USA.",rsleith@nybg.org,NA,NA,"Northeast Algal Society; Northeast Aquatic Plant Management Society; International Phycological Society; Phycological Society of America; Sarah K.

743,Short to Long-Term Forecasting of River Flows by Heuristic Optimization Algorithms Hybridized with ANFIS,"Accurate forecast of short-term to long-term streamflow prediction is of great importance for water resources management. However, with the advent of novel hybrid machine learning methods, it remains unclear whether these hybrid models can outperform the traditional streamflow forecast models. Therefore, in this study, we trained and tested the performance of several evolutionary algorithms, including Fire-Fly Algorithm(FFA), Genetic Algorithm (GA), Grey Wolf Optimization (GWO), Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO), and Differential Evolution (DE) hybridized with ANFIS. Three forecast horizons, short-term (Daily), mid-term (Weekly and Monthly) and long-term (Annual) with fifteen input-output combinations, a total of 90 models, were developed and tested. A Monte Carlo Simulation (MCS) framework is used for uncertainty analysis. Daily inflow to the Karun III dam, located in the southeast of Iran, for the period of June 2005 to December 2016 were used. Results indicated that: 1) All developed hybrid algorithms significantly outperformed the traditional ANFIS model performance for all prediction horizons. The best hybrid models were ANFIS-GWO1, ANFIS-GWO7 and ANFIS-GWO11 such that the values of R-2, RMSE, NSE, and RAE were improved by 12%, 10%, 18.5% and 14.3% for the short-term forecasts, 15%, 13%, 20% and 21.1% for the mid-term forecasts, and 10.3%, 7.5%, 10.5% and 14% for the long-term forecasts; 2) Uncertainty analysis indicates that nearly all hybrid models have significantly reduced uncertainty levels compared to the traditional ANFIS model; and 3) A simple explicit equation based on the hybrid ANFIS results was provided for streamflow forecasting, which is a major advantage compared to the classical blackbox machine learning models.",https://doi.org/10.1007/s11269-020-02756-5,10.1007/s11269-020-02756-5,J,"Riahi-Madvar, H; Dehghani, M; Memarzadeh, R; Gharabaghi, B",NA,NA,NA,"Riahi-Madvar, Hossien; Dehghani, Majid; Memarzadeh, Rasoul; Gharabaghi, Bahram",NA,NA,y,WATER RESOURCES MANAGEMENT,NA,NA,English,Article,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,Monte Carlo simulation; Uncertainty analysis; Streamflow; Prediction horizon; Explicit estimation; Karun River,NA,"[Riahi-Madvar, Hossien] Vali E Asr Univ Rafsanjan, Dept Water Sci & Engn, Fac Agr, Rafsanjan, Iran; [Dehghani, Majid; Memarzadeh, Rasoul] Vali E Asr Univ Rafsanjan, Dept Civil Engn, Fac Tech & Engn, Rafsanjan, Iran; [Gharabaghi, Bahram] Univ Guelph, Sch Engn, Guelph, ON N1G 2W1, Canada",NA,"Riahi-Madvar, H (corresponding author), Vali E Asr Univ Rafsanjan, Dept Water Sci & Engn, Fac Agr, Rafsanjan, Iran.",h.riahi@vru.ac.ir,"Gharabaghi, Bahram/F-9977-2016; madvar, hossien riahi/U-9334-2019; Bonakdari, Hossein/AAW-5398-2021; Memarzadeh, Rasoul/ABB-7225-2021","Gharabaghi, Bahram/0000-0003-0454-2811; madvar, hossien riahi/0000-0002-5902-4985; Memarzadeh, Rasoul/0000-0002-5946-928X",NA,NA,NA,32,6,6,2,9,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0920-4741,1573-1650,NA,WATER RESOUR MANAG,Water Resour.

744,Deterministic Analysis and Uncertainty Analysis of Ensemble Forecasting Model Based on Variational Mode Decomposition for Estimation of Monthly Groundwater Level,"Precise multi-time scales prediction of groundwater level is essential for water resources planning and management. However, credible and reliable predicting results are hard to achieve even to extensively applied artificial intelligence (AI) models considering the uncontrollable error, indefinite inputs and unneglectable uncertainty during the modelling process. The AI model ensembled with the data pretreatment technique, the input selection method, or uncertainty analysis has been successfully used to tackle this issue, whereas studies about the comprehensive deterministic and uncertainty analysis of hybrid models in groundwater level forecast are rarely reported. In this study, a novel hybrid predictive model combining the variational mode decomposition (VMD) data pretreatment technique, Boruta input selection method, bootstrap based uncertainty analysis, and the extreme learning machine (ELM) model named VBELM was developed for 1-, 2- and 3-month ahead groundwater level prediction in a typical arid oasis area of northwestern China. The historical observed monthly groundwater level, precipitation and temperature data were used as inputs to train and test the model. Specifically, the VMD was used to decompose all the input-outputs into a set of intrinsic mode functions (IMFs), the Boruta method was applied to determine input variables, and the ELM was employed to forecast the value of each IMF. In order to ascertain the efficiency of the proposed VBELM model, the performance of the coupled model (VELM) hybridizing VMD with ELM algorithm and the single ELM model were estimated in comparison. The results indicate that the VBELM performed best, while the single ELM model performed the worst among the three models. Furthermore, the VBELM model presented lower uncertainty than the VELM model with more observed groundwater level values falling inside the confidence interval. In summary, the VBELM model demonstrated an excellent performance for both certainty and uncertainty analyses, and can serve as an effective tool for multi-scale groundwater level forecasting.",https://doi.org/10.3390/w13020139,10.3390/w13020139,J,"Wu, M; Feng, Q; Wen, XH; Yin, ZL; Yang, LS; Sheng, DR",NA,NA,NA,"Wu, Min; Feng, Qi; Wen, Xiaohu; Yin, Zhenliang; Yang, Linshan; Sheng, Danrui",NA,NA,y,WATER,NA,NA,English,Article,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,uncertainty analysis; groundwater level prediction; hybrid predictive model; variational mode decomposition; Boruta technique; extreme learning machine,NA,"[Wu, Min; Feng, Qi; Wen, Xiaohu; Yin, Zhenliang; Yang, Linshan; Sheng, Danrui] Chinese Acad Sci, Northwest Inst Ecoenvironm & Resources, Key Lab Ecohydrol Inland River Basin, Lanzhou 730000, Peoples R China; [Wu, Min; Sheng, Danrui] Univ Chinese Acad Sci, Beijing 100049, Peoples R China; [Wu, Min; Feng, Qi; Wen, Xiaohu; Yin, Zhenliang; Yang, Linshan; Sheng, Danrui] Qilian Mt Ecoenvironm Res Ctr Gansu Prov, Lanzhou 730000, Peoples R China",NA,"Feng, Q; Wen, XH (corresponding author), Chinese Acad Sci, Northwest Inst Ecoenvironm & Resources, Key Lab Ecohydrol Inland River Basin, Lanzhou 730000, Peoples R China.; Feng, Q; Wen, XH (corresponding author), Qilian Mt Ecoenvironm Res Ctr Gansu Prov, Lanzhou 730000, Peoples R China.",wumin@nieer.ac.cn; qifeng@lzb.ac.cn; xhwen@lzb.ac.cn; yinzhenliang@lzb.ac.cn; yanglsh08@lzb.ac.cn; shengdanrui@lzb.ac.cn,"Wen, Xiaohu/AAE-3378-2021","Feng, Qi/0000-0002-5469-1738; Yin, Zhenliang/0000-0001-9050-6328; Yang, Linshan/0000-0002-6862-4106","National Key Research and Development Program, China [2017YFC0404305]; Key Research Program of Frontier Sciences, CAS [QYZDJ-SSW-DQC031]; Natural Science Foundation of Gansu province, China [18JR2RA026, 18JR3RA393]; CAS Light of West China Program","This research was funded by the National Key Research and Development Program, China (2017YFC0404305), the Key Research Program of Frontier Sciences, CAS (QYZDJ-SSW-DQC031), Natural Science Foundation of Gansu province, China (18JR2RA026, 18JR3RA393), CAS Light of West China Program.",NA,73,6,6,7,11,MDPI,BASEL,"ST ALBAN-ANLAGE 66, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND",NA,2073-4441,NA,WATER-SUI,Water,JAN,2021,13,2,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,139,10.3390/w13020139,NA,NA,29,Environmental Sciences; Water Resources,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),Environmental Sciences & Ecology; Water Resources,PY0YJ,WOS:000611775500001,NA,gold,NA,NA,2/17/2022
745,A seasonal forecasting procedure for reservoir inflows in Central Asia,"This study develops a procedure for seasonal forecasting river discharge from headwaters above strategically important hydropower plants in Kyrgyzstan and Tajikistan. The El Nino Southern Oscillation, North Atlantic Oscillation, and Indian Ocean Dipole indices were used as inputs. Predictability was evaluated for average summer inflows conditional on the tercile of the preceding winter climate mode. We find that the winter Nino 3.4 index was significantly positively correlated with following summer inflows to Nurek, Andijan, and Toktogul reservoirs during the period 1941-1980. Kruskal-Wallis and Kolmogorov-Smirnov tests show significant differences in the distributions of summer inflows depending on previous winter Nino 3.4 for all three reservoirs. At Nurek, summer inflows were on average 19% greater following a winter El Nino. During 1941-2016, mean summer inflows to Nurek reservoir linked to previous November-December Nino 3.4 achieved a Heidke Hit Proportion of 51-59% (compared with 33% expected by chance). Acceptable predictions of summer inflow volume were made 44% of the time. Higher inflows are explained by a south-westerly moisture flux that brings above average precipitation to Central Asia during winter El Nino conditions. Our procedure requires limited data, technical or computing resources-all considerations in data sparse, low capacity regions. Given planned developments of other large, headwater impoundments in Central Asia, early outlooks of discharge could contribute to improved dam safety, economic performance, and transboundary water sharing around such projects.",https://doi.org/10.1002/rra.3506,10.1002/rra.3506,J,"Dixon, SG; Wilby, RL",NA,NA,NA,"Dixon, Samuel G.; Wilby, Robert L.",NA,NA,y,RIVER RESEARCH AND APPLICATIONS,NA,NA,English,Article,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,Central Asia; ENSO; hydropower; reservoir; river flow; seasonal forecast,CENTRAL-SOUTHWEST ASIA; INDIAN MONSOON; CLIMATE; PRECIPITATION; STREAMFLOW; ENSO; IMPACT; OCEAN; TELECONNECTION; OSCILLATION,"[Dixon, Samuel G.] Moors Future Partnership, Edale, Derby, England; [Wilby, Robert L.] Loughborough Univ, Dept Geog & Environm, Loughborough LE11 3TU, Leics, England",NA,"Wilby, RL (corresponding author), Loughborough Univ, Dept Geog & Environm, Loughborough LE11 3TU, Leics, England.",r.l.wilby@lboro.ac.uk,NA,NA,European Bank for Reconstruction and Development,"We dedicate this paper to the memory of Geoff Petts who was respectively the PhD grandfather and father to the authors.

746,"Drought forecasting in eastern Australia using multivariate adaptive regression spline, least square support vector machine and M5Tree model","Drought forecasting using standardized metrics of rainfall is a core task in hydrology and water resources management. Standardized Precipitation Index (SPI) is a rainfall-based metric that caters for different time-scales at which the drought occurs, and due to its standardization, is well-suited for forecasting drought at different periods in climatically diverse regions. This study advances drought modelling using multivariate adaptive regression splines (MARS), least square support vector machine (LSSVM), and M5Tree models by forecasting SPI in eastern Australia. MARS model incorporated rainfall as mandatory predictor with month (periodicity), Southern Oscillation Index, Pacific Decadal Oscillation Index and Indian Ocean Dipole, ENSO Modoki and Nino 3.0, 3.4 and 4.0 data added gradually. The performance was evaluated with root mean square error (RMSE), mean absolute error (MAE), and coefficient of determination (r(2)). Best MARS model required different input combinations; where rainfall, sea surface temperature and periodicity were used for all stations, but ENSO Modoki and Pacific Decadal Oscillation indices were not required for Bathurst, Collarenebri and Yamba, and the Southern Oscillation Index was not required for Collarenebri. Inclusion of periodicity increased the r(2) value by 0.5-8.1% and reduced RMSE by 3.0-178.5%. Comparisons showed that MARS superseded the performance of the other counterparts for three out of five stations with lower MAE by 15.0-73.9% and 7.3-42.2%, respectively. For the other stations, M5Tree was better than MARS/LSSVM with lower MAE by 13.8-13.4% and 25.7-52.2%, respectively, and for Bathurst, LSSVM yielded more accurate result. For droughts identified by SPI <= -0.5, accurate forecasts were attained by MARS/M5Tree for Bathurst, Yamba and Peak Hill, whereas for Collarenebri and Barraba, M5Tree was better than LSSVM/MARS. Seasonal analysis revealed disparate results where MARS/M5Tree was better than LSSVM. The results highlight the importance of periodicity in drought forecasting and also ascertains that model accuracy scales with geographic/seasonal factors due to complexity of drought and its relationship with inputs and data attributes that can affect the evolution of drought events.

747,A Preliminary Look at Using Rainfall Average Recurrence Interval to Characterize Flash Flood Events for Real-time Warning Forecasting,"Characterization of flash flood severity in real-time has been highlighted by National Weather Service (NWS) service assessments for almost two decades. Current flash flood warning techniques provide limited guidance on determining potential severity of flood impacts. Recent software updates allowing for the estimation of rainfall average recurrence intervals (ARIs) in real-time help improve the nowcasting of flash flood events, but guidance is lacking on specific ARIs to use as thresholds. Researchers at the NWS Lower Mississippi River Forecast Center collected data for 24 flash flood events across the eastern United States. Reports of flash flooding were characterized based upon relative severity, and then matched to rainfall ARIs. Preliminary results from this study suggest that utilizing the 2-yr ARI contour derived from 3-h rainfall would capture approximately 90% of flash flood reports. It also was found that more significant flash flood impacts generally became more common with an increased 3-h rainfall ARI, with major flooding of roadways or structures (>= 0.91 m, or 3 ft, of inundation) becoming likely by around a 25-yr max ARI for the storm. Because of biases in the available cases used in the analysis, results are considered preliminary and subject to considerable case-by-case variability.",https://doi.org/10.15191/nwajom.2018.0602,10.15191/nwajom.2018.0602,J,"Lincoln, WS; Thomason, RFL",NA,NA,NA,"Lincoln, W.

748,An efficiency dynamic seasonal regression forecasting technique for high variation of water level in Yom River Basin of Thailand,"The Yom River Basin is one of 25 river basins in Thailand. The Yom River Basin experiences perennial droughts and floods that heavily impact the agricultural sector. In order to reduce the impact, water management, including water level estimation, must be applied to critical basins like the Yom River Basin. An important task of management is the quantitative prediction of water levels. Four different modeling approaches were applied to forecast the average monthly water level (AMWL) data from four water level measurement stations for the wet season (May-October) and dry season (November-April) from 2007 to 2020. The forecast patterns obtained from the four approaches were similar to the observed historical values, except the upstream in wet season and downstream in dry season. Furthermore, the artificial neural network (ANN) approach overestimated forecasts for almost every station in both seasons. All four approaches were more accurate in the dry season than the wet season. This study proposed a forecasting method called dynamic seasonal regression (DSR), which was obtained by combining multiple linear regression (MLR) and the autoregressive integrated moving average (ARIIVIA) model of the random error from MLR. DSR was more efficient than ANN, seasonal-ARIMA (SARIMA) and a hybridized SARIMA and ANN approach (SARIMANN). On average, for all stations in wet and dry seasons, DSR reduced RMSE by over 40.86%, 9.10% and 23.07% with respect to ANN, SARIMA and SARIMANN, and MAPE by over 35.01%, 13.02% and 15.96% with respect to ANN, SARIMA and SARIMANN. The RMSE of upstream was higher than the RMSE downstream in the wet season for all methods, and the MAPE of upstream was lower than the downstream in both seasons for all methods. Moreover, the RMSE of upstream was lower than the downstream in the dry season for all methods except the ANN method.",https://doi.org/10.3934/environsci.2021019,10.3934/environsci.2021019,J,"Nualtong, K; Chinram, R; Khwanmuang, P; Kirtsaeng, S; Panityakul, T",NA,NA,NA,"Nualtong, Kitipol; Chinram, Ronnason; Khwanmuang, Piyawan; Kirtsaeng, Sukrit; Panityakul, Thammarat",NA,NA,y,AIMS ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE,NA,NA,English,Article,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,dynamic seasonal regression; ANN; SARIMA; water level; high variation of hydrological cycle basin; Yom River basin,NA,"[Nualtong, Kitipol; Chinram, Ronnason; Khwanmuang, Piyawan; Panityakul, Thammarat] Prince Songkla Univ, Fac Sci, Div Computat Sci, Hat Yai 90110, Songkhla, Thailand; [Kirtsaeng, Sukrit] Thai Meteorol Dept, Bangkok 10260, Thailand",NA,"Panityakul, T (corresponding author), Prince Songkla Univ, Fac Sci, Div Computat Sci, Hat Yai 90110, Songkhla, Thailand.",thammarat.p@psu.ac.th,"Chinram, Ronnason/C-4819-2018","Chinram, Ronnason/0000-0002-6113-3689",NA,NA,NA,21,0,0,0,1,AMER INST MATHEMATICAL SCIENCES-AIMS,SPRINGFIELD,"PO BOX 2604, SPRINGFIELD, MO 65801-2604 USA",2372-0344,2372-0352,NA,AIMS ENVIRON SCI,AIMS Environ.

749,Solving the fourth-corner problem: forecasting ecosystem primary production from spatial multispecies trait-based models,"Forecasting productivity and stress across an ecosystem is complicated by the multiple interactions between competing species, the unknown levels of intra- and interspecific trait plasticity, and the dependencies between those traits within individuals. Integrating these features into a trait-based quantitative framework requires a conceptual and quantitative synthesis of how multiple species and their functional traits interact and respond to changing environments, a challenge known in community ecology as the fourth-corner problem. We propose such a novel synthesis, implemented as an integrated Bayesian hierarchical model. This allows us to (1) simultaneously model trait-trait and trait-environment relationships by explicitly accounting for both intra- and interspecific trait variabilities in a single analysis using all available data types, (2) quantify the strength of the trait-environment relationships, (3) identify trade-offs between multiple traits in multiple species, and (4) faithfully propagate our modeling uncertainties when making species-specific and community-wide trait predictions, reducing false confidence in our spatial prediction results. We apply this integrated approach to the world's largest mangrove forest, the Sundarbans, a sentinel ecosystem impacted simultaneously by both climate change and multiple types of human exploitation. The Sundarbans presents extensive variability in environmental variables, such as salinity and siltation, driven by changing seawater levels from the south and freshwater damming from the north. We find that tree species growing under stress have a typical functional response to the environmental drivers with inter-specific variability around this average, and the amount of variability is further contingent upon the nature and magnitude of the environmental drivers. Our model captures the retreat in traits related to resource acquisition and a plastic enhancement of traits related to resource conservation, both clear indications of stress. We predict that, if historical increases in salinity and siltation are maintained, one-third of whole-ecosystem productivity will be lost by 2050. Our integrated modeling approach bridges community and ecosystem ecology through simultaneously modeling trait-environment correlations and trait-trait trade-offs at organismal, community, and ecosystem levels; provides a generalizable foundation for powerful modeling of trait-environment linkages under changing environments to predict their consequences on ecosystem functioning and services; and is readily applicable across the Earth's ecosystems.",https://doi.org/10.1002/ecm.1454,10.1002/ecm.1454,J,"Sarker, SK; Reeve, R; Matthiopoulos, J",NA,NA,NA,"Sarker, Swapan Kumar; Reeve, Richard; Matthiopoulos, Jason",NA,NA,y,ECOLOGICAL MONOGRAPHS,NA,NA,English,Article,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,Bayesian hierarchical modeling approach; environmental drivers; functional traits; intra- and interspecific variations in traits; species composition; Sundarbans mangrove forest; trait-environment relationships.,PLANT FUNCTIONAL TRAITS; BANGLADESH SUNDARBANS MANGROVES; LIFE-HISTORY STRATEGIES; FOREST DYNAMICS MODEL; SEA-LEVEL RISE; SPECIES TRAITS; ENVIRONMENT RELATIONSHIPS; COMMUNITY ECOLOGY; WOOD DENSITY; ASSEMBLY PROCESSES,"[Sarker, Swapan Kumar; Reeve, Richard; Matthiopoulos, Jason] Univ Glasgow, Coll Med Vet & Life Sci, Inst Biodivers Anim Hlth & Comparat Med, Boyd Orr Ctr Populat & Ecosyst Hlth, Glasgow G12 8QQ, Lanark, Scotland; [Sarker, Swapan Kumar] Shahjalal Univ Sci & Technol, Dept Forestry & Environm Sci, Sylhet 3114, Bangladesh",NA,"Reeve, R (corresponding author), Univ Glasgow, Coll Med Vet & Life Sci, Inst Biodivers Anim Hlth & Comparat Med, Boyd Orr Ctr Populat & Ecosyst Hlth, Glasgow G12 8QQ, Lanark, Scotland.",Richard.Reeve@glasgow.ac.uk,NA,"Sarker, Swapan Kumar/0000-0002-9933-0493","Commonwealth Scholarship Commission, United Kingdom [BDCA-2013-6]; SUST Research Centre, Bangladesh [FES/2020/2/01]; BBSRCUK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Biotechnology and Biological Sciences Research Council (BBSRC) [BB/L004070/1, BB/ P004202/1]; University of Glasgow start-up fund","We are thankful to the editor and reviewers for suggestions that improved this manuscript.

750,Toward an Efficient Uncertainty Quantification of Streamflow Predictions Using Sparse Polynomial Chaos Expansion,"Reliable hydrologic models are essential for planning, designing, and management of water resources. However, predictions by hydrological models are prone to errors due to a variety of sources of uncertainty. More accurate quantification of these uncertainties using a large number of ensembles and model runs is hampered by the high computational burden. In this study, we developed a highly efficient surrogate model constructed by sparse polynomial chaos expansion (SPCE) coupled with the least angle regression method, which enables efficient uncertainty quantifications. Polynomial chaos expansion was employed to surrogate a storage function-based hydrological model (SFM) for nine streamflow events in the Hongcheon watershed of South Korea. The efficiency of SPCE is investigated by comparing it with another surrogate model, full polynomial chaos expansion (FPCE) built by a well-known, ordinary least square regression (OLS) method. This study confirms that (1) the performance of SPCE is superior to that of FPCE because SPCE can build a more accurate surrogate model (i.e., smaller leave-one-out cross-validation error) with one-quarter the size (i.e., 500 versus 2000). (2) SPCE can sufficiently capture the uncertainty of the streamflow, which is comparable to that of SFM. (3) Sensitivity analysis attained through visual inspection and mathematical computation of the Sobol' index has been of great success for SPCE to capture the parameter sensitivity of SFM, identifying four parameters, alpha, K-bas, P-bas, and P-chn, that are most sensitive to the likelihood function, Nash-Sutcliffe efficiency. (4) The computational power of SPCE is about 200 times faster than that of SFM and about four times faster than that of FPCE. The SPCE approach builds a surrogate model quickly and robustly with a more compact experimental design compared to FPCE. Ultimately, it will benefit ensemble streamflow forecasting studies, which must provide information and alerts in real time.",https://doi.org/10.3390/w13020203,10.3390/w13020203,J,"Tran, VN; Kim, J",NA,NA,NA,"Tran, Vinh Ngoc; Kim, Jongho",NA,NA,y,WATER,NA,NA,English,Article,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,surrogate model; sparse polynomial chaos expansion; least angle regression; uncertainty quantification; sensitivity analysis; hydrologic prediction,NA,"[Tran, Vinh Ngoc; Kim, Jongho] Univ Ulsan, Sch Civil & Environm Engn, Ulsan 44610, South Korea",NA,"Kim, J (corresponding author), Univ Ulsan, Sch Civil & Environm Engn, Ulsan 44610, South Korea.",vinhtn@hus.edu.vn; kjongho@ulsan.ac.kr,NA,"Tran, Vinh/0000-0001-8272-4843",University of Ulsan,This work was supported by the 2018 Research Fund of University of Ulsan.,NA,58,1,1,4,6,MDPI,BASEL,"ST ALBAN-ANLAGE 66, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND",NA,2073-4441,NA,WATER-SUI,Water,JAN,2021,13,2,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,203,10.3390/w13020203,NA,NA,19,Environmental Sciences; Water Resources,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),Environmental Sciences & Ecology; Water Resources,PY5AP,WOS:000612057200001,NA,NA,NA,NA,2/17/2022
751,Application of Neural Network Models and ANFIS for Water Level Forecasting of the Salve Faccha Dam in the Andean Zone in Northern Ecuador,"Despite the importance of dams for water distribution of various uses, adequate forecasting on a day-to-day scale is still in great need of intensive study worldwide. Machine learning models have had a wide application in water resource studies and have shown satisfactory results, including the time series forecasting of water levels and dam flows. In this study, neural network models (NN) and adaptive neuro-fuzzy inference systems (ANFIS) models were generated to forecast the water level of the Salve Faccha reservoir, which supplies water to Quito, the Capital of Ecuador. For NN, a non-linear input-output net with a maximum delay of 13 days was used with variation in the number of nodes and hidden layers. For ANFIS, after up to four days of delay, the subtractive clustering algorithm was used with a hyperparameter variation from 0.5 to 0.8. The results indicate that precipitation was not influencing input in the prediction of the reservoir water level. The best neural network and ANFIS models showed high performance, with a r > 0.95, a Nash index > 0.95, and a RMSE < 0.1. The best the neural network model was t + 4, and the best ANFIS model was model t + 6.",https://doi.org/10.3390/w13152011,10.3390/w13152011,J,"Larrea, PP; Zapata-Rios, X; Parra, LC",NA,NA,NA,"Paliz Larrea, Pablo; Zapata-Rios, Xavier; Campozano Parra, Lenin",NA,NA,y,WATER,NA,NA,English,Article,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,machine learning; time series forecast; water level,FUZZY INFERENCE SYSTEM; PART 1; PREDICTION; FLUCTUATIONS; DRIVEN; ANN,"[Paliz Larrea, Pablo; Zapata-Rios, Xavier; Campozano Parra, Lenin] Escuela Politec Nacl, Dept Ingn Civil & Ambienal, Quito 17012579, Ecuador; [Zapata-Rios, Xavier] Escuela Politec Nacl, Ctr Invest & Estudios Recursos Hidr CIERHI, Quito 17012579, Ecuador",NA,"Larrea, PP; Zapata-Rios, X; Parra, LC (corresponding author), Escuela Politec Nacl, Dept Ingn Civil & Ambienal, Quito 17012579, Ecuador.; Zapata-Rios, X (corresponding author), Escuela Politec Nacl, Ctr Invest & Estudios Recursos Hidr CIERHI, Quito 17012579, Ecuador.",pablo.paliz@epn.edu.ec; xavier.zapata@epn.edu.ec; lenin.campozano@epn.edu.ec,NA,NA,Escuela Politecnica Nacional [PIMI-17-04],Financial support provided by Escuela Politecnica Nacional.

752,"Time Series Regression for Forecasting Flood Events in Schenectady, New York","Floods typically occur due to ice jams in the winter or extended periods of precipitation in the spring and summer seasons. An increase in the rate of water discharge in the river coincides with a flood event. This research combines the time series decomposition and the time series regression model for the flood prediction in Mohawk River at Schenectady, New York. The time series decomposition has been applied to separate the different frequencies in hydrogeological and climatic data. The time series data have been decomposed into the long-term, seasonal-term, and short-term components using the Kolmogorov-Zurbenko filter. For the application of the time series regression model, we determine the lags of the hydrogeological and climatic variables that provide the maximum performance for the model. The lags applied in the predictor variables of the model have been used for the physical interpretation of the model to strengthen the relationship between the water discharge and the climatic and hydrogeological variables. The overall model accuracy has been increased up to 73%. The results show that using the lags of the variables in the time regression model, and the forecasting accuracy has been increased compared to the raw data by two times.",https://doi.org/10.3390/geosciences8090317,10.3390/geosciences8090317,J,"Plitnick, TA; Marsellos, AE; Tsakiri, KG",NA,NA,NA,"Plitnick, Thomas A.; Marsellos, Antonios E.; Tsakiri, Katerina G.",NA,NA,y,GEOSCIENCES,NA,NA,English,Article,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,flood prediction; time series regression; multiple linear regression; time series decomposition; Kolmogorov-Zurbenko filter,CLIMATE-CHANGE; RIVER,"[Plitnick, Thomas A.; Marsellos, Antonios E.] Hofstra Univ, Dept Geol Environm & Sustainabil, Hempstead, NY 11549 USA; [Tsakiri, Katerina G.] Rider Univ, Dept Informat Syst & Supply Chain Management, Lawrenceville, NJ 08648 USA",NA,"Marsellos, AE (corresponding author), Hofstra Univ, Dept Geol Environm & Sustainabil, Hempstead, NY 11549 USA.",tplitnick1@pride.hofstra.edu; antonios.e.marsellos@hofstra.edu; ktsakiri@rider.edu,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,41,1,1,0,3,MDPI,BASEL,"ST ALBAN-ANLAGE 66, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND",NA,2076-3263,NA,GEOSCIENCES,Geosciences,SEP,2018,8,9,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,317,10.3390/geosciences8090317,NA,NA,20,"Geosciences, Multidisciplinary",Emerging Sources Citation Index (ESCI),Geology,GY1ZG,WOS:000448335800009,NA,gold,NA,NA,2/17/2022
753,Summer drought predictability over Europe: empirical versus dynamical forecasts,"Seasonal climate forecasts could be an important planning tool for farmers, government and insurance companies that can lead to better and timely management of seasonal climate risks. However, climate seasonal forecasts are often under-used, because potential users are not well aware of the capabilities and limitations of these products. This study aims at assessing the merits and caveats of a statistical empirical method, the ensemble streamflow prediction system (ESP, an ensemble based on reordering historical data) and an operational dynamical forecast system, the European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts-System 4 (S4) in predicting summer drought in Europe. Droughts are defined using the Standardized Precipitation Evapotranspiration Index for the month of August integrated over 6 months. Both systems show useful and mostly comparable deterministic skill. We argue that this source of predictability is mostly attributable to the observed initial conditions. S4 shows only higher skill in terms of ability to probabilistically identify drought occurrence. Thus, currently, both approaches provide useful information and ESP represents a computationally fast alternative to dynamical prediction applications for drought prediction.",https://doi.org/10.1088/1748-9326/aa7859,10.1088/1748-9326/aa7859,J,"Turco, M; Ceglar, A; Prodhomme, C; Soret, A; Toreti, A; Francisco, JDR",NA,NA,NA,"Turco, Marco; Ceglar, Andrej; Prodhomme, Chloe; Soret, Albert; Toreti, Andrea; Francisco, J.

754,A Stochastic Data-Driven Ensemble Forecasting Framework for Water Resources: A Case Study Using Ensemble Members Derived From a Database of Deterministic Wavelet-Based Models,"In water resources applications (e.g., streamflow, rainfall-runoff, urban water demand [UWD], etc.), ensemble member selection and ensemble member weighting are two difficult yet important tasks in the development of ensemble forecasting systems. We propose and test a stochastic data-driven ensemble forecasting framework that uses archived deterministic forecasts as input and results in probabilistic water resources forecasts. In addition to input data and (ensemble) model output uncertainty, the proposed approach integrates both ensemble member selection and weighting uncertainties, using input variable selection and data-driven methods, respectively. Therefore, it does not require one to perform ensemble member selection and weighting separately. We applied the proposed forecasting framework to a previous real-world case study in Montreal, Canada, to forecast daily UWD at multiple lead times. Using wavelet-based forecasts as input data, we develop the Ensemble Wavelet-Stochastic Data-Driven Forecasting Framework, the first multiwavelet ensemble stochastic forecasting framework that produces probabilistic forecasts. For the considered case study, several variants of Ensemble Wavelet-Stochastic Data-Driven Forecasting Framework, produced using different input variable selection methods (partial correlation input selection and Edgeworth Approximations-based conditional mutual information) and data-driven models (multiple linear regression, extreme learning machines, and second-order Volterra series models), are shown to outperform wavelet- and nonwavelet-based benchmarks, especially during a heat wave (first time studied in the UWD forecasting literature).",https://doi.org/10.1029/2018WR023205,10.1029/2018WR023205,J,"Quilty, J; Adamowski, J; Boucher, MA",NA,NA,NA,"Quilty, John; Adamowski, Jan; Boucher, Marie-Amelie",NA,NA,y,WATER RESOURCES RESEARCH,NA,NA,English,Article,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,ensemble forecasting; probabilistic forecasting; stochastic; input variable selection; data driven; wavelets,BACKWARD GREEDY SELECTION; PROBABILISTIC FORECASTS; STREAMFLOW FORECASTS; VARIABLE SELECTION; MUTUAL INFORMATION; PREDICTION SYSTEM; INPUT SELECTION; HYBRID MODELS; OPTIMIZATION; RISK,"[Quilty, John; Adamowski, Jan] McGill Univ, Dept Bioresource Engn, Montreal, PQ, Canada; [Boucher, Marie-Amelie] Univ Sherbrooke, Dept Civil & Bldg Engn, Sherbrooke, PQ, Canada",NA,"Quilty, J (corresponding author), McGill Univ, Dept Bioresource Engn, Montreal, PQ, Canada.",johnmquilty@gmail.com,NA,"Boucher, Marie-Amelie/0000-0002-4246-2444",NSERC Discovery and Accelerator grants,"We thank the City of Montreal for providing the urban water demand data used in this study.

755,Deep Learning Framework with Time Series Analysis Methods for Runoff Prediction,"Recent advances in deep learning, especially the long short-term memory (LSTM) networks, provide some useful insights on how to tackle time series prediction problems, not to mention the development of a time series model itself for prediction. Runoff forecasting is a time series prediction problem with a series of past runoff data (water level and discharge series data) as inputs and a fixed-length series of future runoff as output. Most previous work paid attention to the sufficiency of input data and the structural complexity of deep learning, while less effort has been put into the consideration of data quantity or the processing of original input data-such as time series decomposition, which can better capture the trend of runoff-or unleashing the effective potential of deep learning. Mutual information and seasonal trend decomposition are two useful time series methods in handling data quantity analysis and original data processing. Based on a former study, we proposed a deep learning model combined with time series analysis methods for daily runoff prediction in the middle Yangtze River and analyzed its feasibility and usability with frequently used counterpart models. Furthermore, this research also explored the data quality that affect the performance of the deep learning model. With the application of the time series method, we can effectively get some information about the data quality and data amount that we adopted in the deep learning model. The comparison experiment resulted in two different sites, implying that the proposed model improved the precision of runoff prediction and is much easier and more effective for practical application. In short, time series analysis methods can exert great potential of deep learning in daily runoff prediction and may unleash great potential of artificial intelligence in hydrology research.",https://doi.org/10.3390/w13040575,10.3390/w13040575,J,"Li, ZH; Ling, K; Zhou, LW; Zhu, MD",NA,NA,NA,"Li, Zhenghe; Ling, Kang; Zhou, Liwei; Zhu, Modi",NA,NA,y,WATER,NA,NA,English,Article,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,deep learning framework; runoff prediction; time series analysis; seasonal trend decomposition; mutual information; LSTM,TERM-MEMORY NETWORKS; YANGTZE-RIVER BASIN; WATER-LEVEL; RAINFALL; SEDIMENT; DECOMPOSITION; DISCHARGE; SPRINGS; SYSTEM; MODEL,"[Li, Zhenghe; Ling, Kang; Zhou, Liwei] Huazhong Univ Sci & Technol, Sch Civil & Hydraul Engn, Wuhan 430074, Peoples R China; [Li, Zhenghe; Ling, Kang; Zhou, Liwei] Joint Int Water Secur Res Ctr, Wuhan 430074, Peoples R China; [Li, Zhenghe; Zhu, Modi] Georgia Inst Technol, Sch Civil & Environm Engn, Atlanta, GA 30038 USA",NA,"Ling, K (corresponding author), Huazhong Univ Sci & Technol, Sch Civil & Hydraul Engn, Wuhan 430074, Peoples R China.; Ling, K (corresponding author), Joint Int Water Secur Res Ctr, Wuhan 430074, Peoples R China.",lizhenghe@hust.edu.cn; kling@hust.edu.cn; zhoulw@hust.edu.cn; modizhu@gatech.edu,NA,"Li, Zhenghe/0000-0002-5523-5080",National Key R&D Program of China [2016YFC0402202],"This research was financially supported by the National Key R&D Program of China, grant number 2016YFC0402202.",NA,52,4,4,38,50,MDPI,BASEL,"ST ALBAN-ANLAGE 66, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND",NA,2073-4441,NA,WATER-SUI,Water,FEB,2021,13,4,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,575,10.3390/w13040575,NA,NA,16,Environmental Sciences; Water Resources,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),Environmental Sciences & Ecology; Water Resources,QR0DZ,WOS:000624886900001,NA,gold,NA,NA,2/17/2022
756,"INTEGRATED USE OF GIS, REMOTE SENSING DATA AND A SET OF MODELS FOR OPERATIONAL FLOOD FORECASTING","The research is aimed at the development and testing of the system for operational river flood forecasting. The system is based on the use of a complex of hydrological and hydrodynamic models, as well as in situ and satellite data integrated processing, and implemented on the basis of a service-oriented architecture. A distinctive feature of the system is the complete automation of the entire simulation cycle - from loading initial data to interpreting results, visualizing and alerting interested parties. The theoretical basis for ensuring the coordinated functioning of all system components is the qualimetry of models and polymodel complexes. The practical implementation is carried out using open codes, free software and GIS platform RegionView. All the complexity associated with the use of heterogeneous geographically distributed information resources is hidden from the user. This allows the system to be used not only by specialists in GIS, IT or relevant subject area, but also by other users interested in the results of flood monitoring and forecasting - emergency services, local authorities, commercial organizations and citizens. The described technologies and the system of operational flood forecasting were tested in the Russian Federation on the Northern Dvina River, from the city of Velikiy Ustyug to the city of Kotlas in 2014-2019.

757,"Artificial Neural Network and Multiple Linear Regression for Flood Prediction in Mohawk River, New York","This research introduces a hybrid model for forecasting river flood events with an example of the Mohawk River in New York. Time series analysis and artificial neural networks are combined for the explanation and forecasting of the daily water discharge using hydrogeological and climatic variables. A low pass filter (Kolmogorov-Zurbenko filter) is applied for the decomposition of the time series into different components (long, seasonal, and short-term components). For the prediction of the water discharge time series, each component has been described by applying the multiple linear regression models (MLR), and the artificial neural network (ANN) model. The MLR retains the advantage of the physical interpretation of the water discharge time series. We prove that time series decomposition is essential before the application of any model. Also, decomposition shows that the Mohawk River is affected by multiple time scale components that contribute to the hydrologic cycle of the included watersheds. Comparison of the models proves that the application of the ANN on the decomposed time series improves the accuracy of forecasting flood events. The hybrid model which consists of time series decomposition and artificial neural network leads to a forecasting up to 96% of the explanation for the water discharge time series.",https://doi.org/10.3390/w10091158,10.3390/w10091158,J,"Tsakiri, K; Marsellos, A; Kapetanakis, S",NA,NA,NA,"Tsakiri, Katerina; Marsellos, Antonios; Kapetanakis, Stelios",NA,NA,y,WATER,NA,NA,English,Article,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,artificial neural network; time series decomposition; flood prediction; Kolmogorov-Zurbenko filter; Mohawk River,CLIMATE-CHANGE; TIME-SERIES; MODELS; HYDROLOGY; FORECASTS; VARIABLES; BASIN,"[Tsakiri, Katerina] Rider Univ, Dept Informat Syst & Supply Chain Management, Lawrenceville, NJ 08648 USA; [Marsellos, Antonios] Hofstra Univ, Dept Geol Environm & Sustainabil, Hempstead, NY 11549 USA; [Kapetanakis, Stelios] Univ Brighton, Sch Comp Engn & Math, Brighton BN2 4GJ, E Sussex, England",NA,"Tsakiri, K (corresponding author), Rider Univ, Dept Informat Syst & Supply Chain Management, Lawrenceville, NJ 08648 USA.",ktsakiri@rider.edu; antonios.e.marsellos@hofstra.edu; s.kapetanakis@brighton.ac.uk,NA,", Stelios/0000-0003-1749-7327",NA,NA,NA,57,30,30,2,6,MDPI,BASEL,"ST ALBAN-ANLAGE 66, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND",NA,2073-4441,NA,WATER-SUI,Water,SEP,2018,10,9,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,1158,10.3390/w10091158,NA,NA,20,Environmental Sciences; Water Resources,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),Environmental Sciences & Ecology; Water Resources,GY7UR,WOS:000448821900050,NA,gold,NA,NA,2/17/2022
758,Data Preprocessing to Enhance Flow Forecasting in a Tropical River Basin,"Missing hydrometric data is a critical issue for water resources management projects and problems related to flow damage and risk assessment. Though numerous ways can be found in the literature to impute them (i.e. Box-Jenkins models, Linear regression models, case deletion, listwise and pairwise deletion, etc.), not all will render effective on a given dataset. in tropical river basin, it's still needed to develop proven and simplified methods to deal with hydrometric data missingness and scarcity. This paper presents the analyses including an assessment of the condition of the existing hydrometric data and works related to the way in which the record was treated for flow forecasting purposes and the construction of the artificial neural network (ANN) models used for predicting the flows. The study was led based on 15-min rainfall, water surface elevation and discharge data, derived from the continuous real-time monitoring station located in the del Medio River Basin from the years 2012 to 2016. As a result, the proposed modeling approach followed two modeling methods, one employing the missing data record and the other was used a multiple imputation (MI) technique to impute the missing data and forecast flow for 1, 2 and 4 h ahead under each approach. The statistical metrics results for the two-modeling approaches, suggest the non-imputed data scenario to rule out the imputed data. This means it is recommended to further optimize the MI technique if to be used effectively to fill in the missing required days of measurements for estimating H3 gaps and afterwards to forecast the flow employing multilayer perceptron (MLP), artificial neural networks (ANNs) with 10-fold cross-validation.",https://doi.org/10.1007/978-3-319-65172-9_36,10.1007/978-3-319-65172-9_36,C,"Simmonds, J; Gomez, JA; Ledezma, A",NA,"Boracchi, G; Iliadis, L; Jayne, C; Likas, A",NA,"Simmonds, Jose; Gomez, Juan A.; Ledezma, Agapito",NA,NA,y,"ENGINEERING APPLICATIONS OF NEURAL NETWORKS, EANN 2017",Communications in Computer and Information Science,NA,English,Proceedings Paper,18th International Conference on Engineering Applications of Neural Networks (EANN),"AUG 25-27, 2017","Athens, GREECE",NA,NA,Artificial neural network; Computational intelligence; Data imputation; Discharge; River basin,MISSING DATA,"[Simmonds, Jose; Ledezma, Agapito] Univ Carlos III Madrid, Dept Informat, Ave Univ 30, Leganes 28911, Spain; [Gomez, Juan A.] Univ Panama, Dept Biol Marina, Estafeta Univ,Apartado 3366, Panama City 4, Panama",NA,"Simmonds, J (corresponding author), Univ Carlos III Madrid, Dept Informat, Ave Univ 30, Leganes 28911, Spain.",jose.simmonds@alumnos.uc3m.es; juanay05@hotmail.com; ledezma@inf.uc3m.es,"LEDEZMA, AGAPITO ISMAEL/K-3929-2014","LEDEZMA, AGAPITO ISMAEL/0000-0002-0041-6829","Spanish MICINNSpanish Government [TRA2015-63708-R, TRA2016-78886-C3-1-R]","The authors of this experiment will like to express their appreciation to Minera Panama S.A., Environmental Department for providing the necessary data.

759,Multistep-ahead daily inflow forecasting using the ERA-Interim reanalysis data set based on gradient-boosting regression trees,"Inflow forecasting plays an essential role in reservoir management and operation. The impacts of climate change and human activities have made accurate inflow prediction increasingly difficult, especially for longer lead times. In this study, a new hybrid inflow forecast framework - using the ERA-Interim reanalysis data set as input and adopting gradient-boosting regression trees (GBRT) and the maximal information coefficient (MIC) - is developed for multistep-ahead daily inflow forecasting. Firstly, the ERA-Interim reanalysis data set provides more information for the framework, allowing it to discover inflow for longer lead times. Secondly, MIC can identify an effective feature subset from massive features that significantly affects inflow; therefore, the framework can reduce computational burden, distinguish key attributes from unimportant ones and provide a concise understanding of inflow. Lastly, GBRT is a prediction model in the form of an ensemble of decision trees, and it has a strong ability to more fully capture nonlinear relationships between input and output at longer lead times. The Xiaowan hydropower station, located in Yunnan Province, China, was selected as the study area. Six evaluation criteria, namely the mean absolute error (MAE), the root-mean-squared error (RMSE), the Pearson correlation coefficient (CORR), Kling-Gupta efficiency (KGE) scores, the percent bias in the flow duration curve high-segment volume (BHV) and the index of agreement (IA) are used to evaluate the established models utilizing historical daily inflow data (1 January 2017-31 December 2018). The performance of the presented framework is compared to that of artificial neural network (ANN), support vector regression (SVR) and multiple linear regression (MLR) models. The results indicate that reanalysis data enhance the accuracy of inflow forecasting for all of the lead times studied (1-10 d), and the method developed generally performs better than other models, especially for extreme values and longer lead times (4-10 d).",https://doi.org/10.5194/hess-24-2343-2020,10.5194/hess-24-2343-2020,J,"Liao, SL; Liu, ZW; Liu, BX; Cheng, CT; Jin, XF; Zhao, ZP",NA,NA,NA,"Liao, Shengli; Liu, Zhanwei; Liu, Benxi; Cheng, Chuntian; Jin, Xinfeng; Zhao, Zhipeng",NA,NA,y,HYDROLOGY AND EARTH SYSTEM SCIENCES,NA,NA,English,Article,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,SUPPORT VECTOR REGRESSION; ARTIFICIAL NEURAL-NETWORK; EXTREME LEARNING-MACHINE; FEATURE-SELECTION; MODEL; RIVER; INFORMATION; INTELLIGENCE; RESERVOIR; UNCERTAINTY,"[Liao, Shengli; Liu, Zhanwei; Liu, Benxi; Cheng, Chuntian; Jin, Xinfeng; Zhao, Zhipeng] Dalian Univ Technol, Inst Hydropower Syst & Hydroinformat, Dalian 116024, Peoples R China; [Liao, Shengli; Liu, Zhanwei; Liu, Benxi; Cheng, Chuntian; Jin, Xinfeng; Zhao, Zhipeng] Dalian Univ Technol, Minist Educ, Key Lab Ocean Energy Utilizat & Energy Conservat, Dalian 116024, Peoples R China",NA,"Liu, ZW (corresponding author), Dalian Univ Technol, Inst Hydropower Syst & Hydroinformat, Dalian 116024, Peoples R China.; Liu, ZW (corresponding author), Dalian Univ Technol, Minist Educ, Key Lab Ocean Energy Utilizat & Energy Conservat, Dalian 116024, Peoples R China.",337891617@qq.com,NA,NA,"National Natural Science Foundation of ChinaNational Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC) [51979023, U1765103]; Liaoning Province Natural Science Foundation of ChinaNatural Science Foundation of Liaoning Province [20180550354]",This research has been supported by the National Natural Science Foundation of China (grant nos. 51979023 and U1765103) and the Liaoning Province Natural Science Foundation of China (grant no. 20180550354).,NA,71,8,8,8,24,COPERNICUS GESELLSCHAFT MBH,GOTTINGEN,"BAHNHOFSALLEE 1E, GOTTINGEN, 37081, GERMANY",1027-5606,1607-7938,NA,HYDROL EARTH SYST SC,Hydrol.

760,The Annual Maximum Flood Peak Discharge Forecasting Using Hermite Projection Pursuit Regression with SSO and LS Method,"Accurate prediction of extreme flood peak discharge is essential in developing the best management practices to avoid and reduce flood disaster. In recent years, many techniques have been pronounced as a branch of computer science to model wide range of hydrological process. Nevertheless, exploration of more efficient technique is necessary in terms of accuracy and applicability. In this study, a novel hermite-PPR model with SSO and LS algorithm is proposed for designing annual maximum flood peak discharge forecasting model at Yichang station on Yangtze River in China. The statistical properties of the data series are utilized for identifying an appropriate input vector to the model and then the performance of the proposed models were compared with adaptive neuro-fuzzy inference system (ANFIS), artificial neural network (ANN) and multiple linear regression (MLR) methods in terms of root mean squared error (RMSE), mean absolute relative error (MARE), coefficient of correlation (CC), Nash-Sutcliffe efficiency coefficient (NSEC) and qualified rate (QR).

761,Forecasting surface water temperature in lakes: A comparison of approaches,"Accurate water temperature forecasting in lake systems is important for environmental impact assessment and fisheries management, among others. In this study, two models are developed and applied for water temperature forecasting in lake systems: (1) the multi-layer perceptron neural network (MLPNN) model; and (2) the wavelet transform and MLPNN integrated model (WT_MLPNN). The models are applied to forecast daily lake surface water temperature (LSWT) of eight lowland Polish lakes. Long-term daily LSWT from eight lakes and daily air temperatures from seven meteorological stations are used for daily LSWT forecasting. The results from the two models are compared with those obtained from two other widely used models: the physically-statistically based hybrid air2water model and a non-linear regression model (S-curve). The modelling results show that the air2water model performs the best, followed by the WT_MLPNN, MLPNN, and the non-linear regression model. Overall, the air2water, WT_MLPNN, and MLPNN models reproduce well the seasonal and inter-annual variations of the LSWT dynamics in the eight lakes. The non-linear regression model, although providing the lowest accuracy, can still provide good preliminary estimates of the LSWT for the eight lakes. The outcomes of the present research can provide references for forecasting lake surface water temperature and sustainable management of lake ecosystems.",https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jhydrol.2020.124809,10.1016/j.jhydrol.2020.124809,J,"Zhu, SL; Ptak, M; Yaseen, ZM; Dai, JY; Sivakumar, B",NA,NA,NA,"Zhu, Senlin; Ptak, Mariusz; Yaseen, Zaher Mundher; Dai, Jiangyu; Sivakumar, Bellie",NA,NA,y,JOURNAL OF HYDROLOGY,NA,NA,English,Article,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,Lake surface water temperature; Air2water; Artificial neural network; Wavelet transform; Non-linear regression; Polish lakes,ARTIFICIAL NEURAL-NETWORK; AIR-TEMPERATURE; WAVELET TRANSFORM; CLIMATE-CHANGE; PREDICTION; MODEL; SIMULATION; TIME; DECOMPOSITION; HYDROLOGY,"[Zhu, Senlin; Dai, Jiangyu] Nanjing Hydraul Res Inst, State Key Lab Hydrol Water Resources & Hydraul En, Nanjing 210029, Peoples R China; [Zhu, Senlin] Univ Houston, Cullen Coll Engn, Dept Civil & Environm Engn, Houston, TX 77204 USA; [Ptak, Mariusz] Adam Mickiewicz Univ, Dept Hydrol & Water Management, Krygowskiego 10, PL-61680 Poznan, Poland; [Yaseen, Zaher Mundher] Ton Duc Thang Univ, Fac Civil Engn, Sustainable Dev Civil Engn Res Grp, Ho Chi Minh City, Vietnam; [Sivakumar, Bellie] Indian Inst Technol, Dept Civil Engn, Mumbai 400076, Maharashtra, India",NA,"Zhu, SL; Dai, JY (corresponding author), Nanjing Hydraul Res Inst, State Key Lab Hydrol Water Resources & Hydraul En, Nanjing 210029, Peoples R China.; Zhu, SL (corresponding author), Univ Houston, Cullen Coll Engn, Dept Civil & Environm Engn, Houston, TX 77204 USA.",slzhu@nhri.cn; marp114@wp.pl; yaseen@tdtu.edu.vn; jydai@nhri.cn; b.sivakumar@iitb.ac.in,"Yaseen, Zaher Mundher/G-7029-2018; Ptak, Mariusz/O-3217-2015","Yaseen, Zaher Mundher/0000-0003-3647-7137; Ptak, Mariusz/0000-0003-1225-1686",Project of the National Natural Science Foundation of ChinaNational Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC) [51679146]; Young Elite Scientists Sponsorship Program by CAST [2017QNRC001]; China Postdoctoral Science FoundationChina Postdoctoral Science Foundation [2018M640499],"The authors acknowledge the Institute of Meteorology and Water Management-National Research Institute in Poland for providing the data used in this study.

762,DroughtCast: A Machine Learning Forecast of the United States Drought Monitor,"Drought is one of the most ecologically and economically devastating natural phenomena affecting the United States, causing the U.S. economy billions of dollars in damage, and driving widespread degradation of ecosystem health. Many drought indices are implemented to monitor the current extent and status of drought so stakeholders such as farmers and local governments can appropriately respond. Methods to forecast drought conditions weeks to months in advance are less common but would provide a more effective early warning system to enhance drought response, mitigation, and adaptation planning. To resolve this issue, we introduce DroughtCast, a machine learning framework for forecasting the United States Drought Monitor (USDM). DroughtCast operates on the knowledge that recent anomalies in hydrology and meteorology drive future changes in drought conditions. We use simulated meteorology and satellite observed soil moisture as inputs into a recurrent neural network to accurately forecast the USDM between 1 and 12 weeks into the future. Our analysis shows that precipitation, soil moisture, and temperature are the most important input variables when forecasting future drought conditions. Additionally, a case study of the 2017 Northern Plains Flash Drought shows that DroughtCast was able to forecast a very extreme drought event up to 12 weeks before its onset. Given the favorable forecasting skill of the model, DroughtCast may provide a promising tool for land managers and local governments in preparing for and mitigating the effects of drought.",https://doi.org/10.3389/fdata.2021.773478,10.3389/fdata.2021.773478,J,"Brust, C; Kimball, JS; Maneta, MP; Jencso, K; Reichle, RH",NA,NA,NA,"Brust, Colin; Kimball, John S.; Maneta, Marco P.; Jencso, Kelsey; Reichle, Rolf H.",NA,NA,y,FRONTIERS IN BIG DATA,NA,NA,English,Article,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,machine learning; drought; recurrent neural network; U; S; drought monitor; forecasting; SMAP,CATCHMENT-BASED APPROACH; LAND-SURFACE PROCESSES; US DROUGHT; FLASH DROUGHTS; SOIL-MOISTURE; MODEL; PRECIPITATION; MODIS,"[Brust, Colin; Kimball, John S.] Univ Montana, WA Franke Coll Forestry & Conservat, Numer Terradynam Simulat Grp, Missoula, MT 59812 USA; [Maneta, Marco P.] Univ Montana, Geosci Dept, Reg Hydrol Lab, Missoula, MT 59812 USA; [Maneta, Marco P.] Univ Montana, WA Franke Coll Forestry & Conservat, Dept Ecosyst & Conservat Sci, Missoula, MT 59812 USA; [Jencso, Kelsey] Univ Montana, WA Franke Coll Forestry & Conservat, Montana Climate Off, Missoula, MT 59812 USA; [Reichle, Rolf H.] NASA, Global Modeling & Assimilat Off, Goddard Space Flight Ctr, Greenbelt, MD USA",NA,"Brust, C (corresponding author), Univ Montana, WA Franke Coll Forestry & Conservat, Numer Terradynam Simulat Grp, Missoula, MT 59812 USA.",colin.brust@mso.umt.edu,NA,NA,"USDAUnited States Department of Agriculture (USDA) [2016-67026-25067]; NASANational Aeronautics & Space Administration (NASA) [80NSSC18M0025M, 80NSSC18K0738, NX14AI50G/JPL#1422120]","& nbsp;This research was conducted at the University of Montana.

763,Comparing the performances of WRF QPF and PERSIANN-CCS QPEs in karst flood simulation and forecasting by coupling the Karst-Liuxihe model,"Long-term rainfall data are crucial for flood simulations and forecasting in karst regions. However, in karst areas, there is often a lack of suitable precipitation data available to build distributed hydrological models to forecast karst floods. Quantitative precipitation forecasts (QPFs) and estimates (QPEs) could provide rational methods to acquire the available precipitation data for karst areas. Furthermore, coupling a physically based hydrological model with QPFs and QPEs could greatly enhance the performance and extend the lead time of flood forecasting in karst areas. This study served two main purposes. One purpose was to compare the performance of the Weather Research and Forecasting (WRF) QPFs with that of the Precipitation Estimations through Remotely Sensed Information based on the Artificial Neural Network-Cloud Classification System (PERSIANN-CCS) QPEs in rainfall forecasting in karst river basins. The other purpose was to test the feasibility and effective application of karst flood simulation and forecasting by coupling the WRF and PERSIANN models with the Karst-Liuxihe model. The rainfall forecasting results showed that the precipitation distributions of the 2 weather models were very similar to the observed rainfall results. However, the precipitation amounts forecasted by WRF QPF were larger than those measured by the rain gauges, while the quantities forecasted by the PERSIANN-CCS QPEs were smaller. A postprocessing algorithm was proposed in this paper to correct the rainfall estimates produced by the two weather models. The flood simulations achieved based on the postprocessed WRF QPF and PERSIANN-CCS QPEs coupled with the Karst-Liuxihe model were much improved over previous results. In particular, coupling the postprocessed WRF QPF with the Karst-Liuxihe model could greatly extend the lead time of flood forecasting, and a maximum lead time of 96 h is adequate for flood warnings and emergency responses, which is extremely important in flood simulations and forecasting.",https://doi.org/10.1007/s11707-021-0909-6,10.1007/s11707-021-0909-6,J,"Li, J; Yuan, DX; Sun, YC; Li, JH",NA,NA,NA,"Li, Ji; Yuan, Daoxian; Sun, Yuchuan; Li, Jianhong",NA,NA,y,FRONTIERS OF EARTH SCIENCE,NA,NA,English,Article; Early Access,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,WRF QPF; PERSIANN-CCS QPEs; the Karst-Liuxihe model; flood simulation and forecasting; karst river basin,PRECIPITATION ESTIMATION; HYDROLOGICAL MODELS; NEURAL-NETWORK; SYSTEM; UNCERTAINTY; DEPENDENCE; CLIMATE; REGION,"[Li, Ji; Yuan, Daoxian; Sun, Yuchuan] Southwest Univ, Chongqing Jinfo Mt Karst Ecosyst Natl Observ & Re, Sch Geog Sci, Chongqing 400715, Peoples R China; [Li, Ji; Yuan, Daoxian; Li, Jianhong] CAGS, Inst Karst Geol, Key Lab Karst Dynam MNR & Guangxi, Guilin 541004, Peoples R China",NA,"Li, J (corresponding author), Southwest Univ, Chongqing Jinfo Mt Karst Ecosyst Natl Observ & Re, Sch Geog Sci, Chongqing 400715, Peoples R China.; Li, J (corresponding author), CAGS, Inst Karst Geol, Key Lab Karst Dynam MNR & Guangxi, Guilin 541004, Peoples R China.",445776649@qq.com,NA,NA,"National Science Foundation for Young Scientists of China [42101031]; Chongqing Natural Science FoundationNatural Science Foundation of Chongqing [cstc2021jcyj-msxm0007]; Open Project Program of Guangxi Key Science and Technology Innovation Base on Karst Dynamics (KDL Guangxi) [202009, 202012]; National Natural Science Foundation of ChinaNational Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC) [41830648]","This study was supported by the National Science Foundation for Young Scientists of China (No. 42101031), Chongqing Natural Science Foundation (No. cstc2021jcyj-msxm0007), the Open Project Program of Guangxi Key Science and Technology Innovation Base on Karst Dynamics (KDL & Guangxi 202009, KDL & Guangxi 202012), and the National Natural Science Foundation of China (Grant No. 41830648).",NA,62,0,0,6,6,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"ONE NEW YORK PLAZA, SUITE 4600, NEW YORK, NY, UNITED STATES",2095-0195,2095-0209,NA,FRONT EARTH SCI-PRC,Front.

764,Runoff forecast and analysis of the probability of dry and wet transition in the Hanjiang River Basin,"Runoff prediction plays an important guiding role in water resources planning and management, flood and drought prevention. As the Hanjiang River Basin (HRB) is the water source of the middle line of the South-to-North Water Diversion Project, it has higher requirements for water resources accurate prediction. In order to analyze the prediction capabilities of different prediction methods for the HRB runoff, this study constructed 12 prediction models to simulate and predict the runoff of four hydrological stations in the HRB. Furthermore, the Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) method was used to analyze the transition probability of runoff from low-to-high (high-to-low). The results showed that the runoff of four hydrological stations in the HRB all showed a downward trend, and most of the sudden changes occurred in the 1980 s. The smoother the runoff changes, the easier it is to make accurate prediction. Among the 12 models, the quadric spline Markov forecasting model (QS-MFM), moving average Markov forecasting model (MA-MFM), Markov forecasting model (MFM), deep neural networks (DNN), and cubic exponential smoothing (CES) methods have stronger generalization ability and can more accurately predict the runoff of the HRB. The average relative error during the validation period is 0.27, 0.28, 0.33, 0.34 and 0.39, respectively. The logistic model can accurately simulate the change of runoff status in the HRB.

765,Constraining the ensemble Kalman filter for improved streamflow forecasting,"Data assimilation techniques such as the Ensemble Kalman Filter (EnKF) are often applied to hydrological models with minimal state volume/capacity constraints enforced during ensemble generation. Flux constraints are rarely, if ever, applied. Consequently, model states can be adjusted beyond physically reasonable limits, compromising the integrity of model output. In this paper, we investigate the effect of constraining the EnKF on forecast performance. A free run in which no assimilation is applied is compared to a completely unconstrained EnKF implementation, a 'typical' hydrological implementation (in which mass constraints are enforced to ensure non-negativity and capacity thresholds of model states are not exceeded), and then to a more tightly constrained implementation where flux as well as mass constraints are imposed to force the rate of water movement to/from ensemble states to be within physically consistent boundaries. A three year period (2008-2010) was selected from the available data record (1976-2010). This was specifically chosen as it had no significant data gaps and represented well the range of flows observed in the longer dataset. Over this period, the standard implementation of the EnKF (no constraints) contained eight hydrological events where (multiple) physically inconsistent state adjustments were made. All were selected for analysis. Mass constraints alone did little to improve forecast performance; in fact, several were significantly degraded compared to the free run. In contrast, the combined use of mass and flux constraints significantly improved forecast performance in six events relative to all other implementations, while the remaining two events showed no significant difference in performance. Placing flux as well as mass constraints on the data assimilation framework encourages physically consistent state estimation and results in more accurate and reliable forward predictions of streamflow for robust decision-making. We also experiment with the observation error, which has a profound effect on filter performance. We note an interesting tension exists between specifying an error which reflects known uncertainties and errors in the measurement versus an error that allows optimal filter updating.

766,Hindcasting eutrophication and changes in temperature and storage volume in a semi-arid reservoir: a multi-decadal Landsat-based assessment,"In situ monitoring of freshwater systems is often constrained by cost and accessibility, particularly in developing countries and in remote areas. Satellite remote sensing is therefore increasingly being integrated with existing in situ water quality monitoring programs. In this study, we use the Landsat TM/ETM+ image record collected between 1984 and 2015 to track temporal changes in trophic status, chlorophyll-a levels, algal bloom incidences, water clarity, water temperature, and reservoir water volume in a poorly monitored hypereutrophic semi-arid reservoir. Historical reservoir water quality data are inferred from calibrated Landsat-based empirical algorithms. The results show that, although the reservoir has existed in a eutrophic to hypereutrophic state over the past 30years, its water quality has significantly deteriorated in the most recent decade. Mean summer chlorophyll-a concentrations were found to have increased by around 163% between 1984 and 2015, while water clarity dropped by more than 58% over the same period. Statistically significant changes in surface water temperatures were also apparent for the month of August, with a cumulative increase of 1.24 degrees C over the 31-year study period. The rise in temperature appears to correlate with the incidence of Microcystis blooms observed in the reservoir over the past decade. On the other hand, the water volume in the reservoir was found to have been fairly stable over time, likely as a result of adaptive reservoir management. This study demonstrates the strength of using Landsat data to hindcast and quantify changes in water quality and quantity in poorly monitored freshwater systems.",https://doi.org/10.1007/s10661-018-7180-7,10.1007/s10661-018-7180-7,J,"Deutsch, ES; Alameddine, I",NA,NA,NA,"Deutsch, Eliza S.; Alameddine, Ibrahim",NA,NA,y,ENVIRONMENTAL MONITORING AND ASSESSMENT,NA,NA,English,Article,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,Remote sensing; Qaraoun Reservoir; Landsat; Chlorophyll-a; Secchi disk depth; Eutrophication,HARMFUL CYANOBACTERIAL BLOOMS; WATER-SURFACE TEMPERATURE; SINGLE-CHANNEL METHOD; QARAAOUN RESERVOIR; THEMATIC MAPPER; LAKE-ERIE; RADIOMETRIC CALIBRATION; SATELLITE IMAGES; SHALLOW LAKES; CHLOROPHYLL-A,"[Deutsch, Eliza S.; Alameddine, Ibrahim] Amer Univ Beirut, Maroun Semaan Fac Engn & Architecture, Dept Civil & Environm Engn, Bliss St, Beirut, Lebanon",NA,"Alameddine, I (corresponding author), Amer Univ Beirut, Maroun Semaan Fac Engn & Architecture, Dept Civil & Environm Engn, Bliss St, Beirut, Lebanon.",ia04@aub.edu.lb,"Alameddine, Ibrahim/R-5332-2019; Alameddine, Ibrahim/D-9365-2013","Alameddine, Ibrahim/0000-0002-8974-1985;",United States Agency for International Development through the USAID-NSF PEER initiativeUnited States Agency for International Development (USAID)National Science Foundation (NSF)NSF - Office of the Director (OD) [AID-OAA-A-I1-00012]; US National Science Foundation under (NSF)National Science Foundation (NSF) [CBET-1058027]; American University of Beirut University Research Board [103008]; National Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada (NSERC) PGS-D Scholarship Program,This study was generously supported through the United States Agency for International Development through the USAID-NSF PEER initiative (grant no.

767,"A Comparative Assessment of Artificial Neural Network, Generalized Regression Neural Network, Least-Square Support Vector Regression, and K-Nearest Neighbor Regression for Monthly Streamflow Forecasting in Linear and Nonlinear Conditions","Monthly forecasting of streamflow is of particular importance in water resources management especially in the provision of rule curves for dams. In this paper, the performance of four data-driven models with different structures including Artificial Neural Network (ANN), Generalized Regression Neural Network (GRNN), Least Square-Support Vector Regression (LS-SVR), and K-Nearest Neighbor Regression (KNN) are evaluated in order to forecast monthly inflow to Karkheh dam, Iran, in linear and non-linear conditions while the optimized values of the model parameters are determined in the same condition via the Leave-One-Out Cross Validation (LOOCV) method. Results show that the performance of the models is different in linear and nonlinear conditions; the cumulative ranking of the models according to the three assessment criteria including NSE, RMSE and R-2 indicates that ANN performs best in linear conditions while LS-SVR, GRNN and KNN are in the next ranks, respectively.

768,FORECASTING SURFACE WATER LEVEL FLUCTUATIONS OF LAKE SERWY (NORTHEASTERN POLAND) BY ARTIFICIAL NEURAL NETWORKS AND MULTIPLE LINEAR REGRESSION,"The aim of this study is to assess the possibility of forecasting water level fluctuations in a relatively small (<100 km(2)), post-glacial lake located in a temperate climate zone by means of artificial neural networks and multiple linear regression. The area of study was Lake Serwy, located in northeastern Poland. Two artificial neural network (ANN) multilayer perceptron (MLP) and multiple linear regression (MLR) models were built. The following explanatory variables were considered: maximal and minimal temperature (Tmax, Tmin) wind speed (WS), vertical circulation (VC) and water level from previous periods (WL). Additionally, a binary variable describing the period of the year (winter, summer) has been considered in one of the two MLP and MLR models. The forecasting models have been assessed based on selected criteria: mean absolute percentage error (MAPE), root mean squared error (RMSE), coefficient of determination (R2) and mean biased error. Considering their values and absolute deviations from observed values it was concluded that the ANN model using an additional binary variable (MLP_B+) has the best forecasting performance. Absolute deviations from observed values were the determining factor which made this model the most efficient. In the case of the MLP_B+ model, those values were about 10% lower than in other models. The conducted analyses indicated good performance of ANN networks as a forecasting tool for relatively small lakes located in temperate climate zones. It is acknowledged that they enable water level forecasting with greater precision and lower absolute deviations than the use of multiple linear regression models.",https://doi.org/10.3846/16486897.2017.1303498,10.3846/16486897.2017.1303498,J,"Piasecki, A; Jurasz, J; Skowron, R",NA,NA,NA,"Piasecki, Adam; Jurasz, Jakub; Skowron, Rajmund",NA,NA,y,JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL ENGINEERING AND LANDSCAPE MANAGEMENT,NA,NA,English,Article,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,ANN; multiple linear regression; lake Serwy; water level; post-glacial lake,CLIMATE-CHANGE; ARIMA MODELS; DISCHARGE; SUPPORT; TURKEY; ANN,"[Piasecki, Adam; Skowron, Rajmund] Nicholas Copernicus Univ, Dept Hydrol & Water Management, Lwowska 1, PL-87100 Torun, Poland; [Jurasz, Jakub] AGH Univ Sci & Technol, Fac Management, Dept Engn Management, Ul Gramatyka 10, PL-30067 Krakow, Poland",NA,"Jurasz, J (corresponding author), AGH Univ Sci & Technol, Fac Management, Dept Engn Management, Ul Gramatyka 10, PL-30067 Krakow, Poland.",jakubkamiljurasz@gmail.com,"Jurasz, Jakub/ABG-4056-2020; Jurasz, Jakub/T-1759-2017","Jurasz, Jakub/0000-0001-9576-7877; Jurasz, Jakub/0000-0001-9576-7877; Piasecki, Adam/0000-0002-8787-7520",NA,NA,NA,41,8,8,0,1,VILNIUS GEDIMINAS TECH UNIV,VILNIUS,"SAULETEKIO AL 11, VILNIUS, LT-10223, LITHUANIA",1648-6897,1822-4199,NA,J ENVIRON ENG LANDSC,J.

769,Mid and long-term hydrological classification forecasting model based on KDE-BDA and its application research,"In view of the uncertainties in the current mid and long-term hydrological forecast results, a mid and long-term hydrological classification forecasting model based on KDE-BDA is built and its application research is performed. The kernel density estimation method (KDE) is used to improve the distribution density function estimation method in the conventional Bayesian discriminant method (BDA). Based on this, a mid and long-term hydrological classification prediction model based on KDE-BDA was built. An example of its application is demonstrated in the runoff forecast of the Danjiangkou Reservoir in the autumn of September. The results show that different forecasting factors have different forecasting ability for runoff classification (flood, normal, dry). Among them, the 500hPa height field factor has higher forecasting ability for the Danjiangkou runoff category (flood, normal, dry), and the 100hPa height field factor, SST and circulation characteristics have a good indication of the runoff's flood state. The results of Half-Brier score show that the combined forecasting model combines the forecasting advantages of each factor, so the forecasting effect is the best. The pass rate in the simulation period was 89.8%, and the pass rate in the inspection period was 87.5%. The simulation and forecast results were relatively stable.",https://doi.org/10.1088/1755-1315/330/3/032010,10.1088/1755-1315/330/3/032010,C,"Liu, Y; Yin, ZJ; Zhang, Y; Wang, Q",NA,NA,IOP,Liu Yong; Yin Zhijie; Zhang Ying; Wang Qin,NA,NA,y,"2019 INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE ON ADVANCES IN CIVIL ENGINEERING, ENERGY RESOURCES AND ENVIRONMENT ENGINEERING",IOP Conference Series-Earth and Environmental Science,NA,English,Proceedings Paper,"International Conference on Advances in Civil Engineering, Energy Resources and Environment Engineering (ACCESE)","JUN 28-30, 2019","Jilin Jianzhu Univ, Coll Civil Engn, Changchun, PEOPLES R CHINA",NA,"Jilin Jianzhu Univ, Coll Civil Engn",NA,NA,"[Liu Yong; Wang Qin] Nanjing Hydraul Res Inst, State Key Lab Hydrol Water Resources & Hydraul En, Nanjing 210029, Peoples R China; [Yin Zhijie] Minist Water Resources, Informat Ctr, Hydrol Monitor & Forecast Ctr, Beijing 100053, Peoples R China; [Zhang Ying] Hydraul Engn Planning Bur Jiangsu Prov, Nanjing 210029, Peoples R China",NA,"Liu, Y (corresponding author), Nanjing Hydraul Res Inst, State Key Lab Hydrol Water Resources & Hydraul En, Nanjing 210029, Peoples R China.",yongliu@nhri.cn,NA,NA,"National Key Research and Development Program of China [2016YFC0400910, 2016YFC0401502]; National Natural Science Foundation of ChinaNational Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC) [51609140, 51809252]","This research was financially supported by the National Key Research and Development Program of China (No. 2016YFC0400910, 2016YFC0401502), the National Natural Science Foundation of China (No. 51609140, 51809252).",NA,11,0,0,1,1,IOP PUBLISHING LTD,BRISTOL,"DIRAC HOUSE, TEMPLE BACK, BRISTOL BS1 6BE, ENGLAND",1755-1307,NA,NA,IOP C SER EARTH ENV,IOP Conf.

770,"Performance evaluation of artificial intelligence paradigms-artificial neural networks, fuzzy logic, and adaptive neuro-fuzzy inference system for flood prediction","Flood prediction has gained prominence world over due to the calamitous socio-economic impacts this hazard has and the anticipated increase of its incidence in the near future. Artificial intelligence (AI) models have contributed significantly over the last few decades by providing improved accuracy and economical solutions to simulate physical flood processes. This study explores the potential of the AI computing paradigm to model the stream flow. Artificial neural network (ANN), fuzzy logic, and adaptive neuro-fuzzy inference system (ANFIS) algorithms are used to develop nine different flood prediction models using all the available training algorithms. The performance of the developed models is evaluated using multiple statistical performance evaluators. The predictability and robustness of the models are tested through the simulation of a major flood event in the study area. A total of 12 inputs were used in the development of the models. Five training algorithms were used to develop the ANN models (Bayesian regularization, Levenberg Marquardt, conjugate gradient, scaled conjugate gradient, and resilient backpropagation), two fuzzy inference systems to develop fuzzy models (Mamdani and Sugeno), and two training algorithms to develop the ANFIS models (hybrid and backpropagation). The ANFIS model developed using hybrid training algorithm gave the best performance metrics with Nash-Sutcliffe Model Efficiency (NSE) of 0.968, coefficient of correlation (R-2) of 97.066%, mean square error (MSE) of 0.00034, root mean square error (RMSE) of 0.018, mean absolute error (MAE) of 0.0073, and combined accuracy (CA) of 0.018, implying the potential of using the developed models for flood forecasting. The significance of this research lies in the fact that a combination of multiple inputs and AI algorithms has been used to develop the flood models. In summary, this research revealed the potential of AI algorithm-based models in predicting floods and also developed some useful techniques that can be used by the Flood Control Departments of various states/regions/countries for flood prognosis.",https://doi.org/10.1007/s11356-021-12410-1,10.1007/s11356-021-12410-1,J,"Tabbussum, R; Dar, AQ",NA,NA,NA,"Tabbussum, Ruhhee; Dar, Abdul Qayoom",NA,NA,y,ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE AND POLLUTION RESEARCH,NA,NA,English,Article,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,Adaptive neuro-fuzzy inference system; Flood forecasting; Gaussian membership function; Levenberg Marquardt neural network; Subtractive clustering; Takagi-Sugeno fuzzy inference system,NA,"[Tabbussum, Ruhhee; Dar, Abdul Qayoom] Natl Inst Technol Srinagar, Dept Civil Engn, Srinagar 190006, Jammu & Kashmir, India",NA,"Tabbussum, R (corresponding author), Natl Inst Technol Srinagar, Dept Civil Engn, Srinagar 190006, Jammu & Kashmir, India.",ruhhee_10phd17@nitsri.ac.in; aqayoom20011@yahoo.com,"Tabbussum, Ruhhee/AAT-4239-2020","Tabbussum, Ruhhee/0000-0002-9926-6276; Dar, Abdul Qayoom/0000-0001-7663-2168",Ministry of Human Resources and Development-India,"This research is funded by the Ministry of Human Resources and Development-India, through the scholarship granted to Ruhhee Tabbussum.",NA,99,4,4,1,8,SPRINGER HEIDELBERG,HEIDELBERG,"TIERGARTENSTRASSE 17, D-69121 HEIDELBERG, GERMANY",0944-1344,1614-7499,NA,ENVIRON SCI POLLUT R,Environ.

771,Geomagnetic Field Measurement at Earth Surface: Flash Flood Forecasting using Tesla Meter,"Flash floods can be regarded as an apical natural hazard in many countries that eminently affect the safety of the human lives, precious belongings, livestock and agricultural farming land. Variety of techniques like engineering (construction of dams and reservoirs) and non engineering (prior investigation of flash floods) has been advanced to forecast the run offs. An efficient disaster management system requires early predicted recommendations for rescue and announcement of exit routes in heavy runoffs. Sewages are the most complex mixture therefore it is not an easy task to build a model for the estimation of rainfall magnitude and time of non-linear runoffs occurrence. Earth can be regarded as a source of magnetic field known as geomagnetic field having range from 25 mu T to 65 mu T. This research paper elaborated the investigation of flash floods by observing the magnetic field lines using Tesla or magnetometer. Hourly based reading of magnetometer shows that during the runoffs the geomagnetic field briskly reduced. Results proved that during the run offs geomagnetic radiated by the earth got promptly reduced therefore geomagnetic field can be a yardstick to estimate the flash floods.

772,High-resolution hydrologic forecasting for very large urban areas,"With continuing growth of urban populations worldwide, high-resolution hydrologic forecasting is an increasingly important hydroinformatics service for large urban areas. In the Dallas-Fort Worth (DFW) area, the Collaborative Adapting Sensing of Atmosphere (CASA) WX program has been providing real-time hydrologic products, such as rainfall and streamflow, at 1 min-500 m resolution using the NWS Research Hydrologic Distributed Model forced by the Quantitative Precipitation Estimate from a network of X-band weather radars. There is an increasing demand, however, for even higher-spatial resolution hydrologic products. In this paper, we assess the ability of the current streamflow product to capture the hydrologic response of urban catchments in the DFW area, the utility of ultrasonic distance sensors for real-time sensing of water level in urban streams, and the feasibility of higher-resolution operation using parallel processing and cloud computing. We show that the CASA WX streamflow product skillfully captures the stage and streamflow response from rainfall for the majority of the nine catchments studied, but that timing errors significantly deteriorate the quality of streamflow prediction for certain basins. Comparative evaluation of different computing models shows that a reduction in runtime of up to 34% is possible with parallel processing at 1 min-250 m resolution.",https://doi.org/10.2166/hydro.2019.100,10.2166/hydro.2019.100,J,"Habibi, H; Dasgupta, I; Noh, S; Kim, S; Zink, M; Seo, DJ; Bartos, M; Kerkez, B",NA,NA,NA,"Habibi, Hamideh; Dasgupta, Ishita; Noh, Seongjin; Kim, Sunghee; Zink, Michael; Seo, Dong-Jun; Bartos, Matthew; Kerkez, Branko",NA,NA,y,JOURNAL OF HYDROINFORMATICS,NA,NA,English,Article,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,distributed computing; urban hydrologic forecasting; water-level sensing,QUANTITATIVE PRECIPITATION ESTIMATION; ESTIMATION SYSTEM; MODEL; STORM,"[Habibi, Hamideh; Noh, Seongjin; Kim, Sunghee; Seo, Dong-Jun] Univ Texas Arlington, Dept Civil Engn, Arlington, TX 76019 USA; [Dasgupta, Ishita] Univ Massachusetts, Coll Informat & Comp Sci, Amherst, MA 01003 USA; [Zink, Michael] Univ Massachusetts, Dept Elect & Comp Engn, Amherst, MA 01003 USA; [Bartos, Matthew; Kerkez, Branko] Univ Michigan, Dept Civil & Environm Engn, Ann Arbor, MI 48109 USA; [Habibi, Hamideh] Prairie View A&M Univ, Prairie View, TX USA",NA,"Habibi, H (corresponding author), Univ Texas Arlington, Dept Civil Engn, Arlington, TX 76019 USA.",hamideh.habibi@mavs.uta.edu,"Noh, Seong Jin/I-3607-2019","Noh, Seong Jin/0000-0002-2683-7269; Bartos, Matthew/0000-0001-6421-222X","NSFNational Science Foundation (NSF) [CyberSEES-1442735, CNS-1350752]; NOAA's JTTI Program [NA17OAR4590184]","This material is based upon work supported in part by theNSF under Grants CyberSEES-1442735 and CNS-1350752, and by the NOAA's JTTI Program under Grant NA17OAR4590184.

773,Ice Forecasting in the Next-Generation Great Lakes Operational Forecast System (GLOFS),"Ice Cover in the Great Lakes has significant impacts on regional weather, economy, lake ecology, and human safety. However, forecast guidance for the lakes is largely focused on the ice-free season and associated state variables (currents, water temperatures, etc.) A coupled lake-ice model is proposed with potential to provide valuable information to stakeholders and society at large about the current and near-future state of Great Lakes Ice. The model is run for three of the five Great Lakes for prior years and the modeled ice cover is compared to observations via several skill metrics. Model hindcasts of ice conditions reveal reasonable simulation of year-to-year variability of ice extent, ice season duration, and spatial distribution, though some years appear to be prone to higher error. This modeling framework will serve as the basis for NOAA's next-generation Great Lakes Operational Forecast System (GLOFS); a set of 3-D lake circulation forecast modeling systems which provides forecast guidance out to 120 h.",https://doi.org/10.3390/jmse6040123,10.3390/jmse6040123,J,"Anderson, EJ; Fujisaki-Manome, A; Kessler, J; Lang, GA; Chu, PY; Kelley, JG; Chen, Y; Wang, J",NA,NA,NA,"Anderson, Eric J.; Fujisaki-Manome, Ayumi; Kessler, James; Lang, Gregory A.; Chu, Philip Y.; Kelley, John G.

774,SMOTE-Boost-based sparse Bayesian model for flood prediction,"With a significant development of big data analysis and cloud-fog-edge computing, human-centered computing (HCC) has been a hot research topic worldwide. Essentially, HCC is a cross-disciplinary research domain, in which the core idea is to build an efficient interaction among persons, cyber space, and real world. Inspired by the improvement of HCC on big data analysis, we intend to involve related core and technologies to help solve one of the most important issues in the real world, i.e., flood prediction. To minimize the negative impacts brought by floods, researchers pay special attention to improve the accuracy of flood forecasting with quantity of technologies including HCC. However, historical flood data is essentially imbalanced. Imbalanced data causes machine learning classifiers to be more biased towards patterns with majority samples, resulting in poor classification of pattern with minority samples. In this paper, we propose a novel Synthetic Minority Over-sampling Technique (SMOTE)-Boost-based sparse Bayesian model to perform flood prediction with both high accuracy and robustness. The proposed model consists of three modules, namely, SMOTE-based data enhancement, AdaBoost training strategy, and sparse Bayes model construction. In SMOTE-based data enhancement, we adopt a SMOTE algorithm to effectively cover diverse data modes and generate more samples for prediction pattern with minority samples, which greatly alleviates the problem of imbalanced data by involving experts' analysis and users' intentions. During AdaBoost training strategy, we propose a specifically designed AdaBoost training strategy for sparse Bayesian model, which not only adaptively and inclemently increases prediction ability of Bayesian model, but also prevents its over-fitting performance. Essentially, the design of AdaBoost strategy helps keep balance between prediction ability and model complexity, which offers different but effective models over diverse rivers and users. Finally, we construct a sparse Bayesian model based on AdaBoost training strategy, which could offer flood prediction results with high rationality and robustness. We demonstrate the accuracy and effectiveness of the proposed model for flood prediction by conducting experiments on a collected dataset with several comparative methods.",https://doi.org/10.1186/s13638-020-01689-2,10.1186/s13638-020-01689-2,J,"Wu, YR; Ding, YK; Feng, J",NA,NA,NA,"Wu, Yirui; Ding, Yukai; Feng, Jun",NA,NA,y,EURASIP JOURNAL ON WIRELESS COMMUNICATIONS AND NETWORKING,NA,NA,English,Article,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,Human-centered intelligent modeling; Intelligent human-centered computing technique; Big data analyses in HCC; Flood prediction; SMOTE algorithm,COMPUTATION OFFLOADING METHOD; PRIVACY PRESERVATION; BIG-DATA; RECOMMENDATION; CATCHMENTS,"[Wu, Yirui; Ding, Yukai; Feng, Jun] Hohai Univ, Coll Comp & Informat, Nanjing, Peoples R China",NA,"Feng, J (corresponding author), Hohai Univ, Coll Comp & Informat, Nanjing, Peoples R China.",fengjun@hhu.edu.cn,NA,NA,"National Key R&D Program of China [2018YFC0407901]; Natural Science Foundation of ChinaNational Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC) [61702160, 61672273, 61832008]; Science Foundation of Jiangsu [BK20170892]; Key R&D Program Projects in Jiangsu Province [BE2015707]","This work was supported by the National Key R&D Program of China under Grant 2018YFC0407901; the Natural Science Foundation of China under Grant 61702160, Grant 61672273, and Grant 61832008; the Science Foundation of Jiangsu under Grant BK20170892; and Key R&D Program Projects in Jiangsu Province under Grant BE2015707.",NA,44,3,3,0,3,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"ONE NEW YORK PLAZA, SUITE 4600, NEW YORK, NY, UNITED STATES",1687-1472,1687-1499,NA,EURASIP J WIREL COMM,EURASIP J.

775,Simulating and Predicting of Hydrological Time Series Based on TensorFlow Deep Learning,"Hydrological time series refers to the observation time point and the observed time value. The simulation and prediction of hydrological time series will greatly improve the predictability of hydrological time series, which is of great significance for hydrological forecasting. TensorFlow, the second generation of artificial intelligence learning system in Google, has been favored by a large number of researchers by virtue of its high flexibility, portability, multi-language support, and performance optimization. However, the application of deep learning in hydrology is less. Based on the TensorFlow framework, the AR model and the LSTM model are constructed in Python language. The hydrological time series is used as the input object, and the model is deeply studied and trained to simulate and predict the hydrological time series. The effect of the model was tested by fitting degrees and other indexes. The fitting degree of the AR model is 0.9551, and the fitting degree of the LSTM model is 0.8012, which shows the feasibility of the model for predicting the hydrological time series, and puts forward the solution for the limitation of the existing analysis results.",https://doi.org/10.15244/pjoes/81557,10.15244/pjoes/81557,J,"Qin, JB; Liang, J; Chen, T; Lei, XH; Kang, AQ",NA,NA,NA,"Qin, Jinbo; Liang, Ji; Chen, Tao; Lei, Xiaohui; Kang, Aiqing",NA,NA,y,POLISH JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL STUDIES,NA,NA,English,Article,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,TensorFlow; deep learning; AR model; LSTM model; hydrological time series,AUTOREGRESSIVE MODELS; CLASSIFICATION,"[Qin, Jinbo; Liang, Ji] Huazhong Univ Sci & Technol, Wuhan, Hubei, Peoples R China; [Chen, Tao] Jilin Elect Power Co, Elect Power Res Inst, Changcun, Peoples R China; [Lei, Xiaohui; Kang, Aiqing] State Key Lab Simulat & Regulat Water Cycle River, Beijing, Peoples R China; [Lei, Xiaohui; Kang, Aiqing] China Inst Water Resources & Hydropower Res, Beijing, Peoples R China",NA,"Liang, J (corresponding author), Huazhong Univ Sci & Technol, Wuhan, Hubei, Peoples R China.",larkwater1@163.com; lxh@iwhr.com,"lei, xiaohui/P-9669-2017",NA,Independent Innovation Fund-General Program [2017KFYXJJ202]; National Key R&D Program of China [2017YFC0405900],This research is supported by the 2017 Independent Innovation Fund-General Program (2017KFYXJJ202) and National Key R&D Program of China (2017YFC0405900).,NA,32,5,6,7,36,HARD,OLSZTYN 5,"POST-OFFICE BOX, 10-718 OLSZTYN 5, POLAND",1230-1485,2083-5906,NA,POL J ENVIRON STUD,Pol.

776,Comparing ANN and ARIMA model in predicting the discharge of River Opeki from 2010 to 2020,"Many attempts have been made in the recent past to model and forecast streamflow using various techniques with the use of time series techniques proving to be the most common. Time series analysis plays an important role in hydrological research. Traditionally, the class of autoregressive moving average techniques models has been the statistical method most widely used for modelling water discharge, but it has been shown to be deficient in representing nonlinear dynamics inherent in the transformation of runoff data. In contrast, the relatively newly improved and efficient soft computing technique artificial neural networks has the capability to approximate virtually any continuous function up to an arbitrary degree of accuracy, which is not otherwise true of other conventional hydrological techniques. This technique corresponds to human neurological system, which consists of a series of basic computing elements called neurons, which are interconnected together to form networks. The aim of the study is to compare the artificial neural network and autoregressive integrated moving average to model River Opeki discharge (1982-2010) and to use the best predictor to forecast the discharge of the river from 2010 to 2020. The performance of the two models was subjected to statistical test based on correlation coefficient (r) and the root-mean-square error. The result showed that autoregressive integrated moving average performs better considering the level of root-mean-square error and higher correlation coefficient.",https://doi.org/10.1002/rra.3391,10.1002/rra.3391,J,"Fashae, OA; Olusola, AO; Ndubuisi, I; Udomboso, CG",NA,NA,NA,"Fashae, Olutoyin A.; Olusola, Adeyemi O.; Ndubuisi, Ijeoma; Udomboso, Christopher Godwin",NA,NA,y,RIVER RESEARCH AND APPLICATIONS,NA,NA,English,Article,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,ANN; ARIMA; discharge; hydrological; River Opeki,ARTIFICIAL NEURAL-NETWORKS; VARIABLES,"[Fashae, Olutoyin A.; Olusola, Adeyemi O.; Ndubuisi, Ijeoma] Univ Ibadan, Dept Geog, Ibadan, Nigeria; [Udomboso, Christopher Godwin] Univ Ibadan, Dept Stat, Ibadan, Nigeria",NA,"Fashae, OA (corresponding author), Univ Ibadan, Dept Geog, Ibadan, Nigeria.",toyinafashae@yahoo.com,"Olusola, Adeyemi/AAC-9641-2020; Udomboso, Christopher Godwin/AAD-9921-2022; Fashae, Olutoyin/AAJ-6129-2020","Olusola, Adeyemi/0000-0003-2295-5214; Udomboso, Christopher Godwin/0000-0002-0338-8261; Fashae, Olutoyin/0000-0003-0193-7826",NA,NA,NA,48,13,13,2,11,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",1535-1459,1535-1467,NA,RIVER RES APPL,River Res.

777,A data-driven SVR model for long-term runoff prediction and uncertainty analysis based on the Bayesian framework,"Accurate and reliable long-term forecasting plays an important role in water resources management and utilization. In this paper, a hybrid model called SVR-HUP is presented to predict long-term runoff and quantify the prediction uncertainty. The model is created based on three steps. First, appropriate predictors are selected according to the correlations between meteorological factors and runoff. Second, a support vector regression (SVR) model is structured and optimized based on the LibSVM toolbox and a genetic algorithm. Finally, using forecasted and observed runoff, a hydrologic uncertainty processor (HUP) based on a Bayesian framework is used to estimate the posterior probability distribution of the simulated values, and the associated uncertainty of prediction was quantitatively analyzed. Six precision evaluation indexes, including the correlation coefficient (CC), relative root mean square error (RRMSE), relative error (RE), mean absolute percentage error (MAPE), Nash-Sutcliffe efficiency (NSE), and qualification rate (QR), are used to measure the prediction accuracy. As a case study, the proposed approach is applied in the Han River basin, South Central China. Three types of SVR models are established to forecast the monthly, flood season and annual runoff volumes. The results indicate that SVR yields satisfactory accuracy and reliability at all three scales. In addition, the results suggest that the HUP cannot only quantify the uncertainty of prediction based on a confidence interval but also provide a more accurate single value prediction than the initial SVR forecasting result. Thus, the SVR-HUP model provides an alternative method for long-term runoff forecasting.",https://doi.org/10.1007/s00704-017-2186-6,10.1007/s00704-017-2186-6,J,"Liang, ZM; Li, YJ; Hu, YM; Li, BQ; Wang, J",NA,NA,NA,"Liang, Zhongmin; Li, Yujie; Hu, Yiming; Li, Binquan; Wang, Jun",NA,NA,y,THEORETICAL AND APPLIED CLIMATOLOGY,NA,NA,English,Article,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,SUPPORT VECTOR MACHINE; ARTIFICIAL NEURAL-NETWORK; SEA-LEVEL PRESSURE; WAVELET TRANSFORM; GENETIC ALGORITHM; INPUT UNCERTAINTY; DECISION-MAKING; RIVER; PRECIPITATION; STREAMFLOW,"[Liang, Zhongmin; Li, Yujie; Hu, Yiming; Li, Binquan; Wang, Jun] Hohai Univ, Coll Hydrol & Water Resources, 1 Xikang Rd, Nanjing, Jiangsu, Peoples R China",NA,"Liang, ZM (corresponding author), Hohai Univ, Coll Hydrol & Water Resources, 1 Xikang Rd, Nanjing, Jiangsu, Peoples R China.",zmliang@hhu.edu.cn,NA,NA,"National Key Research and Development Program of China [2016YFC0402706, 2016YFC0402707, 2016YFC0402709]","This study was supported by the National Key Research and Development Program of China (Grant Nos. 2016YFC0402706, 2016YFC0402707, and 2016YFC0402709).

778,On the Dominant Factor Controlling Seasonal Hydrological Forecast Skill in China,"Initial conditions (ICs) and climate forecasts (CFs) are the two primary sources of seasonal hydrological forecast skill. However, their relative contribution to predictive skill remains unclear in China. In this study, we investigate the relative roles of ICs and CFs in cumulative runoff (CR) and soil moisture (SM) forecasts using 31-year (1980-2010) ensemble streamflow prediction (ESP) and reverse-ESP (revESP) simulations with the Variable Capacity Infiltration (VIC) hydrologic model. The results show that the relative importance of ICs and CFs largely depends on climate regimes. The influence of ICs is stronger in a dry or wet-to-dry climate regime that covers the northern and western interior regions during the late fall to early summer. In particular, ICs may dominate the forecast skill for up to three months or even six months during late fall and winter months, probably due to the low precipitation value and variability in the dry period. In contrast, CFs become more important for most of southern China or during summer months. The impact of ICs on SM forecasts tends to cover larger domains than on CR forecasts. These findings will greatly benefit future work that will target efforts towards improving current forecast levels for the particular regions and forecast periods.",https://doi.org/10.3390/w9110902,10.3390/w9110902,J,"Zhang, XJ; Tang, QH; Leng, GY; Liu, XC; Li, Z; Huang, ZW",NA,NA,NA,"Zhang, Xuejun; Tang, Qiuhong; Leng, Guoyong; Liu, Xingcai; Li, Zhe; Huang, Zhongwei",NA,NA,y,WATER,NA,NA,English,Article,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,seasonal hydrological forecasts; predictive skill; initial conditions; climate forecasts; hydro-climatic regimes,SOIL-MOISTURE; STREAMFLOW FORECASTS; ECONOMIC VALUE; UNITED-STATES; CLIMATE; MODEL; WATER; PREDICTABILITY; UNCERTAINTY; PREDICTION,"[Zhang, Xuejun; Tang, Qiuhong; Liu, Xingcai; Li, Zhe; Huang, Zhongwei] Chinese Acad Sci, Inst Geog Sci & Nat Resources Res, Key Lab Water Cycle & Related Land Surface Proc, Beijing 100101, Peoples R China; [Tang, Qiuhong; Huang, Zhongwei] Univ Chinese Acad Sci, Beijing 100049, Peoples R China; [Leng, Guoyong] Pacific Northwest Natl Lab, Joint Global Change Res Inst, College Pk, MD 20740 USA",NA,"Tang, QH (corresponding author), Chinese Acad Sci, Inst Geog Sci & Nat Resources Res, Key Lab Water Cycle & Related Land Surface Proc, Beijing 100101, Peoples R China.; Tang, QH (corresponding author), Univ Chinese Acad Sci, Beijing 100049, Peoples R China.",zhangxj.13b@igsnrr.ac.cn; tangqh@igsnrr.ac.cn; guoyong.leng@pnnl.gov; xingcailiu@igsnrr.ac.cn; lizhe@igsnrr.ac.cn; huangzw.14b@igsnrr.ac.cn,"Liu, Xingcai/R-3510-2018; Tang, Qiuhong/ABA-2194-2021; Tang, Qiuhong/AAD-9832-2022","Liu, Xingcai/0000-0001-5726-7353; Tang, Qiuhong/0000-0002-0886-6699; Li, Zhe/0000-0003-3241-5641; Leng, Guoyong/0000-0001-6345-143X","National Natural Science Foundation of ChinaNational Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC) [41425002]; Chinese Postdoctoral Science FoundationChina Postdoctoral Science Foundation [2016M601117]; National Youth Top-notch Talent Support Program in China; Integrated Assessment Research program through the Integrated Multi-sector, Multiscale Modeling (IM3) Scientific Focus Area (SFA) - Biological and Environmental Research Division of Office of Science, U.S. Department of Energy; U.S. DOEUnited States Department of Energy (DOE) [DE-AC05-76RL01830]","Funding for this research is provided by the National Natural Science Foundation of China (41425002), Chinese Postdoctoral Science Foundation (2016M601117), and the National Youth Top-notch Talent Support Program in China.

779,Addressing the incorrect usage of wavelet-based hydrological and water resources forecasting models for real-world applications with best practices and a new forecasting framework,"Many recent studies propose wavelet-based hydrological and water resources forecasting models that have been incorrectly developed and that cannot properly be used for real-world forecasting problems. The incorrect development of these wavelet-based forecasting models occurs during wavelet decomposition (the process of extracting high- and low-frequency information into different sub-time series known as wavelet and scaling coefficients, respectively) and as a result introduces error into the forecast model inputs. The source of this error is due to the boundary condition that is associated with wavelet decomposition (and the wavelet and scaling coefficients) and is linked to three main issues: 1) using 'future data' (i.e., data from the future that is not available); 2) inappropriately selecting decomposition levels and wavelet filters; and 3) not carefully partitioning calibration and validation data. By not addressing these boundary conditions during wavelet decomposition, incorrectly developed wavelet-based forecasting models often result in much better performance than what is realistically achievable. We demonstrate that the discrete wavelet transform (DWT) multiresolution analysis (DWT-MRA) and maximal overlap discrete wavelet transform (MODWT) multiresolution analysis (MODWT-MRA), two commonly adopted wavelet decomposition methods used in the development of hydrological and water resources wavelet-based forecasting models, suffer from these boundary conditions and cannot be used properly for real-world forecasting. However, by following a proposed set of best (correct) practices, we show that the MODWT and a trous algorithm (AT) can be used to correctly forecast target (e.g., hydrological and water resources) processes in real-world scenarios. In this vein, we contribute a set of best practices, which focusses on deriving boundary-corrected wavelet and scaling coefficients from time series data, overcoming the boundary condition issues and providing hydrological and water resources modellers with a justified and coherent strategy for developing wavelet-based forecasting models that may be used for real-world forecasting problems. We coalesce these best practices into a new forecasting framework named Wavelet Data-Driven Forecasting Framework (WDDFF) that uses a combination of input variable selection and data-driven models to convert boundary-corrected wavelet and scaling coefficients into forecasts of a target process. Through a real-world urban water demand forecasting experiment in Montreal, Canada, we demonstrate the superiority of WDDFF against benchmark forecasting models such as (non-wavelet-based) random walk, multiple linear regression, extreme learning machine, and second-order Volterra series models. For the same case study, we also show how the WDDFF provides realistic and accurate forecasts while a recently proposed wavelet-based forecasting model that adopts the (invalid) MODWT-MRA for wavelet decomposition provides incorrect and unrealistic forecasts. We conclude that WDDFF is a useful tool for forecasting real-world hydrological and water resources processes that overcomes the limitations of many earlier wavelet-based forecasting methods and should be explored further for forecasting different processes such as streamflow, rainfall, evaporation, etc.",https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jhydrol.2018.05.003,10.1016/j.jhydrol.2018.05.003,J,"Quilty, J; Adamowski, J",NA,NA,NA,"Quilty, John; Adamowski, Jan",NA,NA,y,JOURNAL OF HYDROLOGY,NA,NA,English,Article,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,Time series; Forecasting; Wavelets; Best practices; Hydrology; Water resources,INPUT VARIABLE SELECTION; SUPPORT VECTOR MACHINE; CONDITIONAL MUTUAL INFORMATION; ARTIFICIAL-INTELLIGENCE MODELS; EXTREME LEARNING-MACHINE; AWASH RIVER-BASIN; NEURAL-NETWORK; LEVEL FLUCTUATIONS; HYBRID MODELS; LINEAR-REGRESSION,"[Quilty, John; Adamowski, Jan] McGill Univ, Dept Bioresource Engn, 21 111 Lakeshore Rd, Ste Anne De Bellevue, PQ H9X 3V9, Canada",NA,"Quilty, J (corresponding author), McGill Univ, Dept Bioresource Engn, 21 111 Lakeshore Rd, Ste Anne De Bellevue, PQ H9X 3V9, Canada.",johnmquilty@gmail.com,NA,NA,NSERC Discovery and Accelerator grants,"The authors are grateful to the Associate Editor and anonymous reviewers for their constructive comments that have significantly improved the quality of this work.

780,Application of Artificial Neural Networks for Accuracy Enhancements of Real-Time Flood Forecasting in the Imjin Basin,"Hydrometeorological forecasts provide future flooding estimates to reduce damages. Despite the advances and progresses in Numerical Weather Prediction (NWP) models, they are still subject to many uncertainties, which cause significant errors forecasting precipitation. Statistical postprocessing techniques can improve forecast skills by reducing the systematic biases in NWP models. Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs) can model complex relationships between input and output data. The application of ANN in water-related research is widely studied; however, there is a lack of studies quantifying the improvement of coupled hydrometeorological model accuracy that use ANN for bias correction of real-time rainfall forecasts. The aim of this study is to evaluate the real-time bias correction of precipitation data, and from a hydrometeorological point of view, an assessment of hydrological model improvements in real-time flood forecasting for the Imjin River (South and North Korea) is performed. The comparison of the forecasted rainfall before and after the bias correction indicated a significant improvement in the statistical error measurement and a decrease in the underestimation of WRF model. The error was reduced remarkably over the Imjin catchment for the accumulated Mean Areal Precipitation (MAP). The performance of the real-time flood forecast improved using the ANN bias correction method.",https://doi.org/10.3390/w10111626,10.3390/w10111626,J,"Jabbari, A; Bae, DH",NA,NA,NA,"Jabbari, Aida; Bae, Deg-Hyo",NA,NA,y,WATER,NA,NA,English,Article,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,ANN; hydrometeorology; flood forecasting; real-time; postprocessing,PRECIPITATION FORECASTS; RAINFALL PREDICTION; BIAS CORRECTION; MODEL; SYSTEMS; INFORMATION; HYDROGRAPH; ALGORITHMS; ENSEMBLES; VARIABLES,"[Jabbari, Aida; Bae, Deg-Hyo] Sejong Univ, Dept Civil & Environm Engn, 98 Gunja Dong, Seoul 143747, South Korea",NA,"Bae, DH (corresponding author), Sejong Univ, Dept Civil & Environm Engn, 98 Gunja Dong, Seoul 143747, South Korea.",ajabbari@sju.ac.kr; dhbae@sejong.ac.kr,NA,NA,"Korea Agency for Infrastructure Technology Advancement (KAIA) - Ministry of Land, Infrastructure [18AWMP-B083066-05]; National Research Foundation of Korea (NRF) - Korea government (MSIP) [2011-0030040]","This research was supported by the Korea Agency for Infrastructure Technology Advancement (KAIA) grant funded by the Ministry of Land, Infrastructure, and Transport (18AWMP-B083066-05) and National Research Foundation of Korea (NRF) grant funded by the Korea government (MSIP) (No. 2011-0030040).",NA,53,17,17,6,18,MDPI,BASEL,"ST ALBAN-ANLAGE 66, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND",2073-4441,NA,NA,WATER-SUI,Water,NOV,2018,10,11,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,1626,10.3390/w10111626,NA,NA,20,Environmental Sciences; Water Resources,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),Environmental Sciences & Ecology; Water Resources,HC3XM,WOS:000451736300133,NA,"gold, Green Submitted",NA,NA,2/17/2022
781,Forecasts consistency and human assessment: what are the next challenges for operational flood forecasting?,"Many operational tools used in France by flood forecasters were first designed to achieve reliable and accurate forecasts at a given location and at a given forecast starting time. Yet, users ask for more frequent forecasts and for more locations. Thus, ensuring the right consistency degree of the forecasts (still maintaining the quality of each forecast taken individually) became recently a major challenge for operational forecasting services. The notion of consistency encompasses several properties: (i) the spatio-temporal consistency of the forecasts issued at a given time on a river network, (ii) the right temporal structure of the forecast for the different lead times and (iii) the consistency of the successive forecasts during a flood event. The analysis focuses on two organizations with different flood forecasting contexts and objectives: the French electricity supplier EDF and the French public Flood Forecasting Services (Vigicrues network). Their forecasters teams are currently working with first tools in order to improve these consistencies. Some of these tools integrate the consistency issue into the hydrometeorological modelling while others facilitate the consideration of this issue in the forecaster's analysis. More applied research and development are still required. In addition to the technical challenge, increasing the number of forecasts issued calls for a controlled balance between the automation of the operational forecasting chain and the gain due to human expertise. Early reflections on forecasts consistency empha-size the utter importance of the human assessment and interpretation in order to achieve good forecasts and the need to position the forecaster well within the operational forecasting organization.",https://doi.org/10.1051/lhb/2019001,10.1051/lhb/2019001,J,"Berthet, L; Valery, A; Garcon, R; Marty, R; Moulin, L; Puygrenier, D; Piotte, O; Le Lay, M; Janet, B; Duquesne, F",NA,NA,NA,"Berthet, Lionel; Valery, Audrey; Garcon, Remy; Marty, Renaud; Moulin, Laetitia; Puygrenier, Damien; Piotte, Olivier; Le Lay, Matthieu; Janet, Bruno; Duquesne, Francois",NA,NA,y,HOUILLE BLANCHE-REVUE INTERNATIONALE DE L EAU,NA,NA,French,Article,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,flood forecasting; operational challenges; spatial consistency; temporal consistency; human expertise; operational systems,SIMULATION,"[Berthet, Lionel; Marty, Renaud] DREAL Ctr Val Loire, SPC LCI, Orleans, France; [Valery, Audrey; Garcon, Remy; Moulin, Laetitia; Puygrenier, Damien; Le Lay, Matthieu] Elect France, EDF, DTG, Paris, France; [Piotte, Olivier; Janet, Bruno; Duquesne, Francois] SCHAPI, DGPR, MTES, Paris, France",NA,"Berthet, L (corresponding author), DREAL Ctr Val Loire, SPC LCI, Orleans, France.",lionel.berthet@developpement-durable.gouv.fr; audrey.valery@edf.fr; remy.garcon@edf.fr; renaud.marty@developpement-durable.gouv.fr; laetitia.moulin@edf.fr; damien.puygrenier@edf.fr; olivier.piotte@developpement-durable.gouv.fr; mathieu.le-lay@edf.fr; bruno.janet@developpement-durable.gouv.fr; francois.duquesne@developpement-durable.gouv.fr,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,15,1,1,1,12,TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD,ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OR14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0018-6368,1958-5551,NA,HOUILLE BLANCHE,Houille Blanche-Rev.

782,Simultaneous streamflow forecasting based on hybridized neuro-fuzzy method for a river system,"Assessment in simulating river flows for a river system can be implemented simultaneously. In general, the majority of the researchers emphasize forecasting on single output for a river system. The present study investigates the applicability and capability of coactive neuro-fuzzy inference system (CANFIS) for simultaneous river flow forecasting for a Barak river system in Assam, India. Besides, two other hybrid model approaches were developed by optimizing the parameters of CANFIS to adopt model's consistency toward achieving more precise and sensitive result which includes the combination of the CANFIS using genetic algorithm (CANFIS-GA) and CANFIS using firefly algorithm (CANFIS-FA). In total, 19,728 sets of recorded hourly concurrent flows data have been collected from different gauging sites pertaining to monsoon seasons. The results of the models (CANFIS, CANFIS-GA and CANFIS-FA) are evaluated, and the best-fit forecasting model(s) is determined using various statistical performance criterions. Also, this study witnessed the significant improvement in the quality of flow forecasting of traditional CANFIS when integrated using metaheuristics algorithms GA and FA. Besides, performance comparisons of the models are made using the artificial neural networks and probabilistics neural networks. In overall, results suggested that CANFIS-FA considerably improved upon other models and provides more better and accurate results for simultaneous flow forecasting in a river system.",https://doi.org/10.1007/s00521-020-05194-x,10.1007/s00521-020-05194-x,J,"Tripura, J; Roy, P; Barbhuiya, AK",NA,NA,NA,"Tripura, Joseph; Roy, Parthajit; Barbhuiya, A.

783,Skillful Decadal Prediction of Droughts Over Large-Scale River Basins Across the Globe,"Long-term droughts, closely linked to oceanic climate variability, are a great threat to the global economy, as well as food and water security. Skillful predictions will provide enormous benefit to the human societies. By taking advantages of the newly available decadal hindcasts and target experiments from the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project phase 6 (CMIP6), this paper evaluates potential predictability and decadal prediction skill of droughts over major river basins across the globe. The results show that the CMIP6 drought prediction is skillful within 3-6 years, and the skill score is 11% higher than CMIP5 over 47% river basins. Prediction skill is enhanced by 15% (16%) over 47% (49%) basins, forced by the actual sea surface temperature over tropical eastern Pacific (North Atlantic).

784,Changes in South American hydroclimate under projected Amazonian deforestation,"Continued deforestation in the Amazon forest can alter the subsurface/surface and atmospheric branches of the hydrologic cycle. The sign and magnitude of these changes depend on the complex interactions between the water, energy, and momentum budgets. To understand these changes, we use the weather research and forecasting (WRF) model with improved representation of groundwater dynamics and the added feature of Amazonian moisture tracers. The control simulation uses moderate resolution imaging spectroradiometer (MODIS) based observations of land use, and the deforestation simulations use a business-as-usual scenario projected for 2040-2050. Our results show that deforestation leads to changes that are seasonally very different. During the dry season, deforestation results in increased albedo and less available net radiation. This change, together with reduced leaf area, results in decreased evapotranspiration (ET), less atmospheric moisture of Amazonian origin, and an increase in temperature. However, we find no changes in precipitation over the basin. Conversely, during the wet season, surface winds increase significantly due to decreased surface roughness. Vapor transport increases throughout the deforested region and leads to an increase in easterly moisture export, and significant decrease in precipitation within the deforested regions of Eastern Amazon. Contrary to expectations, the moisture tracers in WRF show no evidence that precipitation decreases are due to recycling or changes in stability.",https://doi.org/10.1111/nyas.14364,10.1111/nyas.14364,J,"Eiras-Barca, J; Dominguez, F; Yang, Z; Chug, D; Nieto, R; Gimeno, L; Miguez-Macho, G",NA,NA,NA,"Eiras-Barca, Jorge; Dominguez, Francina; Yang, Zhao; Chug, Divyansh; Nieto, Raquel; Gimeno, Luis; Miguez-Macho, Gonzalo",NA,NA,y,ANNALS OF THE NEW YORK ACADEMY OF SCIENCES,NA,NA,English,Article,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,Amazon basin; hydroclimate; deforestation; business-as-usual scenario; changes,REGIONAL CLIMATE; LAND-USE; TROPICAL DEFORESTATION; MOISTURE TRANSPORT; COVER CHANGE; DRY-SEASON; MODEL; WATER; RAINFALL; BRAZIL,"[Eiras-Barca, Jorge; Dominguez, Francina; Yang, Zhao; Chug, Divyansh] Univ Illinois, Dept Atmospher Sci, 3088A NHB, Urbana, IL 61801 USA; [Eiras-Barca, Jorge; Nieto, Raquel; Gimeno, Luis] Univ Vigo, CIM UVIGO, Environm Phys Lab EPhysLab, Orense, Spain; [Yang, Zhao] Pacific Northwest Natl Lab, Richland, WA 99352 USA; [Miguez-Macho, Gonzalo] Univ Santiago de Compostela, Nonlinear Phys Grp, Galicia, Spain",NA,"Eiras-Barca, J (corresponding author), Univ Illinois, Dept Atmospher Sci, 3088A NHB, Urbana, IL 61801 USA.",jeiras@uvigo.es,"Dominguez, Francina/AAH-6741-2020; GIMENO, LUIS/B-8137-2008; Eiras-Barca, Jorge/AAW-4756-2020","Eiras-Barca, Jorge/0000-0003-4401-5944; Miguez-Macho, Gonzalo/0000-0002-4259-7883; Chug, Divyansh/0000-0003-3891-7108","Spanish regional government Xunta de Galicia [ED4181B 2018/069]; Fulbright Commission (U.S. Department of State) [ED4181B 2018/069]; National Science Foundation (NSF) CAREER AwardNational Science Foundation (NSF)NSF - Office of the Director (OD) [AGS 1454089]; Future Investigators in the NASA Earth and Space Science and Technology (FINESST) 2019 Award; Ministerio de Ciencia, Innovacion y Universidades, Spain [RTI2018-095772-B-I00]; Xunta de GaliciaXunta de GaliciaEuropean Commission [ED431C 2017/64-GRC]","E.B. was supported by the program ED4181B 2018/069 from the Spanish regional government Xunta de Galicia and the Fulbright Commission (U.S. Department of State).

785,Distinguishing high and low flow domains in urban drainage systems 2 days ahead using numerical weather prediction ensembles,"Precipitation constitutes a major contribution to the flow in urban storm-and wastewater systems. Forecasts of the anticipated runoff flows, created from radar extrapolation and/or numerical weather predictions, can potentially be used to optimize operation in both wet and dry weather periods. However, flow forecasts are inevitably uncertain and their use will ultimately require a trade-off between the value of knowing what will happen in the future and the probability and consequence of being wrong. In this study we examine how ensemble forecasts from the HIRLAM-DMI-S05 numerical weather prediction (NWP) model subject to three different ensemble post-processing approaches can be used to forecast flow exceedance in a combined sewer for a wide range of ratios between the probability of detection (POD) and the probability of false detection (POFD). We use a hydrological rainfall-runoff model to transform the forecasted rainfall into forecasted flow series and evaluate three different approaches to establishing the relative operating characteristics (ROC) diagram of the forecast, which is a plot of POD against POFD for each fraction of concordant ensemble members and can be used to select the weight of evidence that matches the desired trade-off between POD and POFD. In the first approach, the rainfall input to the model is calculated for each of 25 ensemble members as a weighted average of rainfall from the NWP cells over the catchment where the weights are proportional to the areal intersection between the catchment and the NWP cells. In the second approach, a total of 2825 flow ensembles are generated using rainfall input from the neighbouring NWP cells up to approximately 6 cells in all directions from the catchment. In the third approach, the first approach is extended spatially by successively increasing the area covered and for each spatial increase and each time step selecting only the cell with the highest intensity resulting in a total of 175 ensemble members. While the first and second approaches have the disadvantage of not covering the full range of the ROC diagram and being computationally heavy, respectively, the third approach leads to both a broad coverage of the ROC diagram range at a relatively low computational cost. A broad coverage of the ROC diagram offers a larger selection of prediction skill to choose from to best match to the prediction purpose. The study distinguishes itself from earlier research in being the first application to urban hydrology, with fast runoff and small catchments that are highly sensitive to local extremes. Furthermore, no earlier reference has been found on the highly efficient third approach using only neighbouring cells with the highest threat to expand the range of the ROC diagram. This study provides an efficient and robust approach to using ensemble rainfall forecasts affected by bias and misplacement errors for predicting flow threshold exceedance in urban drainage systems.

786,"Research on flood forecasting based on flood hydrograph generalization and random forest in Qiushui River basin, China","At present, the use of hydrological models is the main technical approach for real-time flood forecasting. However, in semi-arid and arid areas, the use of the hydrological model is restricted by technical and data conditions. With the accumulation of hydrological data deluge, making full use of historical data and mining potential hydrological laws, causal relationships and other valuable information behind them provide new ideas for real-time flood forecasting in the study area. This paper develops a hybrid flood forecasting model that combines the flood hydrograph generalization method and random forest in the Qiushui River basin in the middle reaches of the Yellow River. The performance of this hybrid model is compared to that of the antecedent precipitation index model. For the development of these models, 23 flood events occurring from 1980 to 2010 are selected, of which 18 are used for calibration and 5 are used for validation. The results show that the hybrid model yields accurate predictions. And the comparison shows that the hybrid model performs better than the empirical model in the Qiushui River basin. Thus, this study provides a method for improving the accuracy of flood forecasting.",https://doi.org/10.2166/hydro.2020.147,10.2166/hydro.2020.147,J,"Tang, TT; Liang, ZM; Hu, YM; Li, BQ; Wang, J",NA,NA,NA,"Tang, Tiantian; Liang, Zhongmin; Hu, Yiming; Li, Binquan; Wang, Jun",NA,NA,y,JOURNAL OF HYDROINFORMATICS,NA,NA,English,Article,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,flood forecasting; flood hydrograph generalization; Qiushui River basin; random forest,MODEL; REPRESENTATION; RESERVOIR; TOOL,"[Tang, Tiantian; Liang, Zhongmin; Hu, Yiming; Li, Binquan; Wang, Jun] Hohai Univ, Coll Hydrol & Water Resources, Nanjing 210098, Peoples R China; [Liang, Zhongmin] Natl Cooperat Innovat Ctr Water Safety & Hydrosci, Nanjing 210024, Peoples R China",NA,"Liang, ZM (corresponding author), Hohai Univ, Coll Hydrol & Water Resources, Nanjing 210098, Peoples R China.",zmliang@hhu.edu.cn,NA,NA,"National Key Research and Development Program of China [2016YFC0402709, 2016YFC0402706]; National Natural Science Foundation of ChinaNational Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC) [41877147]","This work is supported in part by the National Key Research and Development Program of China (2016YFC0402709, 2016YFC0402706), National Natural Science Foundation of China (41730750), and National Natural Science Foundation of China (41877147).

787,Modeling the fish community population dynamics and forecasting the eradication success of an exotic fish from an alpine stream,"Management actions aimed at eradicating exotic fish species from riverine ecosystems can be better informed by forecasting abilities of mechanistic models. We illustrate this point with an example of the Logan River, Utah, originally populated with endemic cutthroat trout (Oncorhynchus clarkii utah), which compete with exotic brown trout (Salmo trutta). The coexistence equilibrium was disrupted by a large scale, experimental removal of the exotic species in 2009-2011 (on average, 8.2% of the stock each year), followed by an increase in the density of the native species. We built a spatially-explicit, reaction-diffusion model encompassing four key processes: population growth in heterogeneous habitat, competition, dispersal, and a management action. We calibrated the model with detailed long-term monitoring data (2001-2016) collected along the 35.4-km long river main channel. Our model, although simple, did a remarkable job reproducing the system steady state prior to the management action. Insights gained from the model independent predictions are consistent with available knowledge and indicate that the exotic species is more competitive; however, the native species still occupies more favorable habitat upstream. Dynamic runs of the model also recreated the observed increase of the native species following the management action. The model can simulate two possible distinct long-term outcomes: recovery or eradication of the exotic species. The processing of available knowledge using Bayesian methods allowed us to conclude that the chance for eradication of the invader was low at the beginning of the experimental removal (0.7% in 2009) and increased (20.5% in 2016) by using more recent monitoring data. We show that accessible mathematical and numerical tools can provide highly informative insights for managers (e.g., outcome of their conservation actions), identify knowledge gaps, and provide testable theory for researchers.",https://doi.org/10.1016/j.biocon.2018.04.024,10.1016/j.biocon.2018.04.024,J,"Laplanche, C; Elger, A; Santoul, F; Thiede, GP; Budy, P",NA,NA,NA,"Laplanche, Christophe; Elger, Arnaud; Santoul, Frederic; Thiede, Gary P.; Budy, Phaedra",NA,NA,y,BIOLOGICAL CONSERVATION,NA,NA,English,Article,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,Invasive species; Population dynamics; Bayesian methods; Management action; Conservation,TROUT SALMO-TRUTTA; BONNEVILLE CUTTHROAT TROUT; JUVENILE ATLANTIC SALMON; NONNATIVE BROWN TROUT; BROOK TROUT; CARRYING-CAPACITY; SALVELINUS-FONTINALIS; MOUNTAIN STREAM; LIFE-HISTORY; ALIEN PLANT,"[Laplanche, Christophe; Elger, Arnaud; Santoul, Frederic] Univ Toulouse, UPS, EcoLab, CNRS,INPT, Toulouse, France; [Thiede, Gary P.; Budy, Phaedra] Utah State Univ, Dept Watershed Sci, Logan, UT 84322 USA; [Thiede, Gary P.; Budy, Phaedra] Utah State Univ, Ecol Ctr, Logan, UT 84322 USA; [Budy, Phaedra] US Geol Survey, Utah Cooperat Fish & Wildlife Res Unit, 959 Natl Ctr, Reston, VA 22092 USA",NA,"Laplanche, C (corresponding author), Univ Toulouse, UPS, EcoLab, CNRS,INPT, Toulouse, France.",christophe.laplanche@ensat.fr,NA,"Santoul, Frederic/0000-0002-2932-2172","Utah Division of Wildlife Resources; U.S. Forest Service, Rocky Mountain Research StationUnited States Department of Agriculture (USDA)United States Forest Service; U.S. Geological Survey Utah Cooperative Fish and Wildlife Research UnitUnited States Geological Survey; Ecology Center at Utah State University; INPT; Utah State University IACUC [2022]","The data collection component of this study was funded by the Utah Division of Wildlife Resources and the U.S. Forest Service, Rocky Mountain Research Station.

788,AR-GARCH with Exogenous Variables as a Postprocessing Model for Improving Streamflow Forecasts,"The common strategy for real-time streamflow forecasting involves a precalibrated rainfall-runoff model for streamflow simulation together with a statistical postprocessing model of simulation errors for updating simulated streamflow. Recognizing both autocorrelation and heteroscedasticity inherent in the simulation errors of rainfall-runoff models, the autoregressive-generalized autoregressive conditional heteroscedasticity (AR-GARCH) model is introduced as a statistical postprocessing model of simulation errors in this study, in which the AR model is used to forecast the mean process of simulation errors, and the GARCH model to forecast the variance process of simulation errors. For investigating how well incorporating exogenous variables that contribute to heteroscedasticity improves update accuracy by comparing the GARCH model with and without exogenous variable, in this study, two rainfall-runoff models (one lumped and one distributed) have been chosen to simulate streamflow in three basins. Case studies show that (1) the AR-GARCH model with an exogenous variable showed advantages over AR-GARCH without exogenous variables through both increased forecast accuracy and reduced uncertainty during the validation period, and (2) more than 90% of error heteroscedasticity is due to the internal variable and less than 10% is due to the exogenous variable in this study. Only one exogenous variable was considered in this study, so further research is necessary to identify more exogenous variables which may have a greater contribution to simulate error heteroscedasticity. In conclusion, the developed AR-GARCH model with exogenous variables has the flexibility to deal with the characteristics of error series including autocorrelation and heteroscedasticity. Although the application of this study focused on streamflow forecasting, the developed methodology may be generalized and implemented in other applications to time-series data with complex errors.",https://doi.org/10.1061/(ASCE)HE.1943-5584.0001955,10.1061/(ASCE)HE.1943-5584.0001955,J,"Zha, XN; Xiong, LH; Guo, SL; Kim, JS; Liu, DD",NA,NA,NA,"Zha, Xini; Xiong, Lihua; Guo, Shenglian; Kim, Jong-Suk; Liu, Dedi",NA,NA,y,JOURNAL OF HYDROLOGIC ENGINEERING,NA,NA,English,Article,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,Rainfall-runoff model; Simulation error; Autocorrelation; Heteroscedasticity; Autoregressive-generalized autoregressive conditional heteroscedasticity (AR-GARCH); Exogenous variables,HYDROLOGICAL MODEL; UNCERTAINTY ESTIMATION; XINANJIANG MODEL; UPDATING MODELS; ERROR; HETEROSCEDASTICITY; AUTOCORRELATION; PERFORMANCE; PREDICTION; INFERENCE,"[Zha, Xini; Xiong, Lihua; Guo, Shenglian; Kim, Jong-Suk; Liu, Dedi] Wuhan Univ, State Key Lab Water Resources & Hydropower Engn S, Wuhan 430072, Peoples R China",NA,"Xiong, LH (corresponding author), Wuhan Univ, State Key Lab Water Resources & Hydropower Engn S, Wuhan 430072, Peoples R China.",Xini_Zha@whu.edu.cn; xionglh@whu.edu.cn; slguo@whu.edu.cn; jongsuk@whu.edu.cn; dediliu@whu.edu.cn,"Kim, Jong-Suk/ABC-9255-2021","Kim, Jong-Suk/0000-0002-5274-5085; Zha, Xini/0000-0002-9675-0695","National Key R&D Program of China [2017YFC0405901]; National Natural Science Foundation of ChinaNational Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC) [41890822, 51525902]; Research Council of Norway (FRINATEK Project)Research Council of Norway [274310]; Ministry of Education Plan 111 Fund of China [B18037]","This study was supported by the National Key R&D Program of China (2017YFC0405901), the National Natural Science Foundation of China (Grant Nos. 41890822 and 51525902), the Research Council of Norway (FRINATEK Project 274310), and the Ministry of Education Plan 111 Fund of China (B18037), all of which are greatly appreciated.

789,River flow prediction in data scarce regions: soil moisture integrated satellite rainfall products outperform rain gauge observations in West Africa,"Satellite precipitation products have been largely improved in the recent years particularly with the launch of the global precipitation measurement (GPM) core satellite. Moreover, the development of techniques for exploiting the information provided by satellite soil moisture to complement/enhance precipitation products have improved the accuracy of accumulated rainfall estimates over land. Such satellite enhanced precipitation products, available with a short latency (<1 day), represent an important and new source of information for river flow prediction and water resources management, particularly in developing countries in which ground observations are scarcely available and the access to such data is not always ensured. In this study, three recently developed rainfall products obtained from the integration of GPM rainfall and satellite soil moisture products have been used; namely GPM+SM2RAIN, PRISM-SMOS, and PRISM-SMAP. The prediction of observed daily river discharge at 10 basins located in Europe (4), West Africa (3) and South Africa (3) is carried out. For comparison, we have also considered three rainfall products based on: (1) GPM only, i.e., the Early Run version of the Integrated Multi-Satellite Retrievals for GPM (GPM-ER), (2) rain gauges, i.e., the Global Precipitation Climatology Centre, and (3) the latest European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts reanalysis, ERA5. Three different conceptual and lumped rainfall-runoff models are employed to obtain robust and reliable results over the 3-year data period 2015-2017. Results indicate that, particularly over scarcely gauged areas (West Africa), the integrated products outperform both ground- and reanalysis-based rainfall estimates. For all basins, the GPM+SM2RAIN product is performing the best among the short latency products with mean Kling-Gupta Efficiency (KGE) equal to 0.87, and significantly better than GPM-ER (mean KGE=0.77). The integrated products are found to reproduce particularly well the high flows. These results highlight the strong need to disseminate such integrated satellite rainfall products for hydrological (and agricultural) applications in poorly gauged areas such as Africa and South America.",https://doi.org/10.1038/s41598-020-69343-x,10.1038/s41598-020-69343-x,J,"Brocca, L; Massari, C; Pellarin, T; Filippucci, P; Ciabatta, L; Camici, S; Kerr, YH; Fernandez-Prieto, D",NA,NA,NA,"Brocca, Luca; Massari, Christian; Pellarin, Thierry; Filippucci, Paolo; Ciabatta, Luca; Camici, Stefania; Kerr, Yann H.; Fernandez-Prieto, Diego",NA,NA,y,SCIENTIFIC REPORTS,NA,NA,English,Article,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,PRECIPITATION PRODUCTS; GLOBAL RAINFALL; LAND; PERFORMANCE; RUNOFF; ASSIMILATION; VERIFICATION; EVAPORATION; VALIDATION; MICROWAVE,"[Brocca, Luca; Massari, Christian; Filippucci, Paolo; Ciabatta, Luca; Camici, Stefania] CNR, Res Inst Geohydrol Protect, Via Madonna Alta 126, I-06128 Perugia, Italy; [Pellarin, Thierry] Univ Grenoble Alpes, Grenoble INP, CNRS, IRD,IGE, F-38000 Grenoble, France; [Kerr, Yann H.] Univ Toulouse 3, CNRS, Ctr Etud Spatiales BIOsphere, CNES,IRD,INRA, Toulouse, France; [Fernandez-Prieto, Diego] European Space Agcy ESA, Frascati, Italy",NA,"Brocca, L (corresponding author), CNR, Res Inst Geohydrol Protect, Via Madonna Alta 126, I-06128 Perugia, Italy.",luca.brocca@irpi.cnr.it,"Filippucci, Paolo/AAA-8114-2022; Brocca, Luca/F-2854-2010; Massari, Christian/H-5037-2019","Filippucci, Paolo/0000-0003-4243-589X; Brocca, Luca/0000-0002-9080-260X; Massari, Christian/0000-0003-0983-1276; CAMICI, STEFANIA/0000-0002-5149-5395",European Space Agency ESAEuropean Space Agency [4000114738/15/I-SBo]; CNES program TOSCA,"This work is supported by the European Space Agency ESA (contract 4000114738/15/I-SBo) project SMOS+Rainfall Land II and by the CNES program TOSCA.

790,Probabilistic streamflow forecast based on spatial post-processing of TIGGE precipitation forecasts,"Ensemble precipitation forecast is effective in reducing the uncertainty and providing reliable probabilistic streamflow forecast. However, for operational applications, precipitation forecasts must go through bias correction in mean and spread. Although post-processing methods, such as BMA, have demonstrated good performance in ensemble-based calibration, the spatial correlation between stations may be altered after post-processing. In this research, ensemble precipitation forecasts of four NWP models, including ECMWF, UKMO, NCEP, and CMA within the TIGGE database, was bias-corrected and post-processed using quantile mapping and BMA for a case study basin in Iran. The ECC method was then used to recover the spatial correlation of ensemble forecasts. Subsequently, probabilistic streamflow forecast was conducted using post-processed precipitation forecasts. The results showed that the errors in the mean and spread of ensemble precipitation forecasts were corrected for each of the four NWP models while the ECC method was effective in maintaining spatial correlation. Furthermore, the results of probabilistic streamflow forecast showed that the performance of the forecast models improved after post processing, with the ECMWF model providing the best forecasts. More work is recommended to improve the impact of the ECC method on NWP models' performance.",https://doi.org/10.1007/s00477-019-01737-4,10.1007/s00477-019-01737-4,J,"Aminyavari, S; Saghafian, B",NA,NA,NA,"Aminyavari, Saleh; Saghafian, Bahram",NA,NA,y,STOCHASTIC ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH AND RISK ASSESSMENT,NA,NA,English,Article,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,Ensemble forecast; TIGGE; Post-processing; ECC; Streamflow forecasting; Iran,ENSEMBLE FORECASTS; TEMPERATURE; RIVER; RAW,"[Aminyavari, Saleh] Islamic Azad Univ, Chalous Branch, Dept Civil Engn, Chalous, Iran; [Saghafian, Bahram] Islamic Azad Univ, Sci & Res Branch, Dept Civil Engn, Tehran, Iran",NA,"Saghafian, B (corresponding author), Islamic Azad Univ, Sci & Res Branch, Dept Civil Engn, Tehran, Iran.",b.saghafian@gmail.com,"Saghafian, Bahram/AAT-9822-2021; Aminyavari, Saleh/AAC-9892-2020","Aminyavari, Saleh/0000-0002-5319-2427",NA,NA,NA,40,6,6,3,8,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"ONE NEW YORK PLAZA, SUITE 4600, NEW YORK, NY, UNITED STATES",1436-3240,1436-3259,NA,STOCH ENV RES RISK A,Stoch.

791,Comprehensive Evaluation of Machine Learning Techniques for Hydrological Drought Forecasting,"Drought is among the most hazardous climatic disasters that significantly influence various aspects of the environment and human life. Qualitative and reliable drought forecasting is important worldwide for effective planning and decision-making in disaster-prone regions. Data-driven models have been extensively used for drought forecasting, but due to the inadequacy of information on model performance, the selection of an appropriate forecasting model remains a challenge. This study concerns a comparative analysis of six machine learning (ML) techniques widely used for hydrological drought forecasting. The standardized runoff index (SRI) was calculated at a seasonal (3-month) time scale for the period 1973 to 2016 in four selected watersheds of the Han River basin in South Korea. The ML models employed were built-ins, using precipitation, temperature, and humidity as input variables and the SRI as the target variable. The results indicated that all the ML models were able to map the relationship for seasonal SRI using the applied input vectors. The decision tree (DT) technique outperformed in all the watersheds with an average mean absolute error (MAE) = 0.26, root mean square error (RMSE) = 0.34, Nash-Sutcliffe efficiency (NSE) = 0.87, and coefficient of determination (R-2) = 0.89. The performances of the support vector machine (SVM) and deep learning neural network (DLNN) were similar, whereas the fuzzy rule-based system (FRBS) performed very well compared to the artificial neural network (ANN) and the adaptive neuro-fuzzy inference system (ANFIS). The overall findings of this study indicate that, considering performance criteria and computation time, the DT was the most accurate ML technique for hydrological drought forecasting in the Han River basin.

792,Evaluation of the Climate Forecast System Reanalysis weather data for the hydrological model in the Arctic watershed Malselv,"The high-resolution Climate Forecast System Reanalysis (CFSR) data have recently become an alternative input for hydrological models in data-sparse regions. However, the quality of CFSR data for running hydrological models in the Arctic is not well studied yet. This paper aims to compare the quality of CFSR data with ground-based data for hydrological modeling in an Arctic watershed, Malselv. The QSWAT model, a coupling of the hydrological model SWAT (soil and water assessment tool) and the QGIS, was applied in this study. The model ran from 1995 to 2012 with a 3-year warm-up period (1995-1997). Calibration (1998-2007), validation (2008-2012), and uncertainty analyses were conducted by the model for each dataset at five hydro-gauging stations within the watershed. The objective function Nash-Sutcliffe coefficient of efficiency for calibration is 0.65-0.82 with CFSR data and 0.55-0.74 with ground-based data, which indicate higher performance of the high-resolution CFSR data than the existing scattered ground-based data. The CFSR weather grid points showed higher variation in precipitation than the ground-based weather stations across the whole watershed. The calculated average annual rainfall by CFSR data for the whole watershed is approximately 24% higher than that by ground-based data, which results in some higher water balance components. The CFSR data also demonstrate its high capacities to replicate the streamflow hydrograph, in terms of timing and magnitude of peak and low flow. Through examination of the uncertainty coefficients P-factors (>= 0.7) and R-factors (<= 1.5), this study concludes that CFSR data are a reliable source for running hydrological models in the Arctic watershed Malselv.",https://doi.org/10.2166/wcc.2021.346,10.2166/wcc.2021.346,J,"Bui, MT; Lu, JM; Nie, LM",NA,NA,NA,"Bui, Minh Tuan; Lu, Jinmei; Nie, Linmei",NA,NA,y,JOURNAL OF WATER AND CLIMATE CHANGE,NA,NA,English,Article,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,Arctic region; Climate Forecast System Reanalysis (CFSR); ground-based weather data; M&#229; lselv watershed; QSWAT model; uncertainty analysis,NA,"[Bui, Minh Tuan; Lu, Jinmei] UiT Arctic Univ Norway, Dept Technol & Safety, Fac Sci & Technol, N-9037 Tromso, Norway; [Nie, Linmei] Fdn CSDI WaterTech, Ctr Sustainable Dev & Innovat Water Technol, N-0373 Oslo, Norway",NA,"Bui, MT (corresponding author), UiT Arctic Univ Norway, Dept Technol & Safety, Fac Sci & Technol, N-9037 Tromso, Norway.",minh.t.bui@uit.no,NA,NA,"Department of Technology and Safety, University of Tromso - The Arctic University of Norway; Research Council Project - Dissemination of climate change research outcomes in cold climate regions [321305]","The authors would like to acknowledge the Department of Technology and Safety, University of Tromso - The Arctic University of Norway, for their financial support and administration for this study.

793,"Prediction of irrigation groundwater quality parameters using ANN, LSTM, and MLR models","Forecasting the irrigation groundwater parameters helps plan irrigation water and crop, and it is commonly expensive because it needs various parameters, mainly in developing nations. Therefore, the present research's core objective is to create accurate and reliable machine learning models for irrigation parameters. To accomplish this determination, three machine learning (ML) models, viz. long short-term memory (LSTM), multi-linear regression (MLR), and artificial neural network (ANN), have been trained. It is validated with mean squared error (MSE) and correlation coefficients (r), root mean square error (RMSE), and mean absolute error (MAE). These machine learning models have been used and applied for predicating the six irrigation water quality parameters such as sodium absorption ratio (SAR), percentage of sodium (%Na), residual sodium carbonate (RSC), magnesium hazard (MH), Permeability Index (PI), and Kelly ratio (KR). Therefore, the two scenario performances of ANN, LSTM, and MLR have been developed for each model to predict irrigation water quality parameters. The first and second scenario performance was created based on all and second reduction input variables. The ANN, LSTM, and MLR models have discovered that excluding for ANN and MLR models shows high accuracy in first and second scenario models, respectively. These model's accuracy was checked based on the mean squared error (MSE), correlation coefficients (r), and root mean square error (RMSE) for training and testing processes serially. The RSC values are highly accurate predicated values using ANN and MLR models. As a result, machine learning models may improve irrigation water quality parameters, and such types of results are essential to farmers and crop planning in various irrigation processes.",https://doi.org/10.1007/s11356-021-17084-3,10.1007/s11356-021-17084-3,J,"Kouadri, S; Pande, CB; Panneerselvam, B; Moharir, KN; Elbeltagi, A",NA,NA,NA,"Kouadri, Saber; Pande, Chaitanya B.; Panneerselvam, Balamurugan; Moharir, Kanak N.; Elbeltagi, Ahmed",NA,NA,y,ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE AND POLLUTION RESEARCH,NA,NA,English,Article; Early Access,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,ANN; LSTM; MLR; Irrigation water quality; Correlation,ARTIFICIAL NEURAL-NETWORK; RIVER WATER-QUALITY; SHORT-TERM-MEMORY; INDEX; POLLUTION; STATE; RESOURCES; OPTIMIZE; RAINFALL; ISFAHAN,"[Kouadri, Saber] Kasdi Merbah Univ Ouargla, Dept Civil Engn & Hydraul, Lab Water & Environm Engn Sahara Milieu GEEMS, Fac Appl Sci, Ouargla, Algeria; [Pande, Chaitanya B.] MPKV Rahuri, CAAST CSAWM, Rahuri, India; [Pande, Chaitanya B.; Moharir, Kanak N.] St Gadge Baba Amravati Univ, Amravati, India; [Panneerselvam, Balamurugan] M Kumarasamy Coll Engn, Dept Civil Engn, Karur, Tamil Nadu, India; [Elbeltagi, Ahmed] Mansoura Univ, Fac Agr, Agr Engn Dept, Mansoura 35516, Egypt; [Elbeltagi, Ahmed] Zhejiang Univ, Coll Environm & Resource Sci, Hangzhou 310058, Peoples R China",NA,"Pande, CB (corresponding author), MPKV Rahuri, CAAST CSAWM, Rahuri, India.; Pande, CB (corresponding author), St Gadge Baba Amravati Univ, Amravati, India.",chaitanay45@gmail.com,"Kouadri, Saber/ABD-2947-2021","Kouadri, Saber/0000-0002-7079-8404; pande, chaitanya/0000-0003-1738-3565",NA,NA,NA,79,2,2,6,6,SPRINGER HEIDELBERG,HEIDELBERG,"TIERGARTENSTRASSE 17, D-69121 HEIDELBERG, GERMANY",0944-1344,1614-7499,NA,ENVIRON SCI POLLUT R,Environ.

794,Collaborative Forecasting and Analysis of Fish Catch in Hokkaido From Multiple Scales by Using Neural Network and ARIMA Model,"Fishery catch forecasting is a crucial aspect of aquatic research because of its relevance to establishing effective fishery management and resource allocation systems. In this study, we aim to forecast and analyze fish catch by collaboratively processing data using methods at multiple scales. To this end, we propose two computational fishery catch forecasting models. A neural network model based on the multi-timescale features of a convolutional neural network and a long short-term memory neural network is proposed and implemented to forecast short-term measures for the daily catch in the eastern ports of Hokkaido, Japan. Similarly, we propose a long-term catch forecasting and analysis model combining the autoregressive integrated moving average (ARIMA) method and a neural network to explore short-term water temperature and long-term catch dependence in the case of sparse data; we implement this method to investigate the total monthly catch in Hokkaido. The experimental results demonstrate that the proposed methods were able to effectively forecast and analyze fishery catch based on different data scales, volumes, and other complex situations. This is also the first work in the field that considers multiple perspectives.",https://doi.org/10.1109/ACCESS.2022.3141767,10.1109/ACCESS.2022.3141767,J,"Zhang, Y; Yamamoto, M; Suzuki, G; Shioya, H",NA,NA,NA,"Zhang, Yue; Yamamoto, Masato; Suzuki, Genki; Shioya, Hiroyuki",NA,NA,y,IEEE ACCESS,NA,NA,English,Article,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,Forecasting; Aquaculture; Predictive models; Feature extraction; Data models; Fish; Convolutional neural networks; ARIMA model; fishery catch forecasting; neural network,WIND-SPEED,"[Zhang, Yue; Yamamoto, Masato; Suzuki, Genki; Shioya, Hiroyuki] Muroran Inst Technol, Div Informat & Elect Engn, Muroran, Hokkaido 0508585, Japan",NA,"Zhang, Y (corresponding author), Muroran Inst Technol, Div Informat & Elect Engn, Muroran, Hokkaido 0508585, Japan.",20096007@mmm.muroran-it.ac.jp,NA,NA,Strategic Information and Communications Research and Development Promotion Programme (SCOPE) through the Ministry of Internal Affairs and Communications [16771288],This research was supported by the Strategic Information and Communications Research and Development Promotion Programme (SCOPE) through the Ministry of Internal Affairs and Communications under Grant 16771288.,NA,38,0,0,0,0,IEEE-INST ELECTRICAL ELECTRONICS ENGINEERS INC,PISCATAWAY,"445 HOES LANE, PISCATAWAY, NJ 08855-4141 USA",2169-3536,NA,NA,IEEE ACCESS,IEEE Access,NA,2022,10,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,7823,7833,NA,10.1109/ACCESS.2022.3141767,NA,NA,11,"Computer Science, Information Systems; Engineering, Electrical & Electronic; Telecommunications",Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),Computer Science; Engineering; Telecommunications,YN3VZ,WOS:000747190300001,NA,gold,NA,NA,2/17/2022
795,Sub seasonal streamflow forecast assessment at large-scale basins,"The sub seasonal forecast horizon, with lead-times up to 7 weeks, has a number of possibilities for operational applications. This sub seasonal time scale is only recently motivated for research on applications, as it is often recognized as being in the gray zone of predictability in both meteorological and hydrological sciences. This work is one of the first assessments of ensemble sub seasonal meteorological inputs to large-scale basin hydrological modelling within a tropical climate - where it could benefit hydropower generation. The quantitative precipitation forecast (QPF) data were provided by the European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts (ECMWF), within the sub seasonal-to-seasonal (S2S) project's context. To assess the quality of the forecasts, a statistical evaluation was performed, including a comparison with the traditional extended streamflow prediction (ESP) technique. Results allowed for an estimation of the error magnitudes and the potential to the benefit of the ensemble over the deterministic reference forecast and the ESP approach. We showed that the sub seasonal QPF-based forecasts have advantages over the ESP, although, generally their skill deteriorates in lead times after day 30. The evaluation across multiple locations considering drainage area and hydrometeorological conditions, suggests that the statistical performance outcome is also spatio-temporal dependent.",https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jhydrol.2020.124635,10.1016/j.jhydrol.2020.124635,J,"Quedi, ES; Fan, FM",NA,NA,NA,"Quedi, Erik Schmitt; Fan, Fernando Mainardi",NA,NA,y,JOURNAL OF HYDROLOGY,NA,NA,English,Article,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,Sub seasonal streamflow forecasting; S2S; MGB-IPH model,ENSEMBLE PREDICTION SYSTEM; SKILL; WEATHER; CLIMATE; BENEFITS; GAUGE; WATER,"[Quedi, Erik Schmitt; Fan, Fernando Mainardi] Univ Fed Rio Grande do Sul, Inst Pesquisas Hidraul, Av Bento Goncalves 9500, BR-90050260 Porto Alegre, RS, Brazil",NA,"Quedi, ES (corresponding author), Univ Fed Rio Grande do Sul, Inst Pesquisas Hidraul, Av Bento Goncalves 9500, BR-90050260 Porto Alegre, RS, Brazil.",erik.quedi@ufrgs.br,"Fan, Fernando Mainardi/I-2421-2019","Fan, Fernando Mainardi/0000-0003-0371-7851",CAPES - BrazilCoordenacao de Aperfeicoamento de Pessoal de Nivel Superior (CAPES),"The authors thank the two anonymous reviewers and Associate Editor Maria-Helena Ramos for the comments that helped to improve the paper.

796,Machine Learning Models for Spring Discharge Forecasting,"Nowadays, drought phenomena increasingly affect large areas of the globe; therefore, the need for a careful and rational management of water resources is becoming more pressing. Considering that most of the world's unfrozen freshwater reserves are stored in aquifers, the capability of prediction of spring discharges is a crucial issue. An approach based on water balance is often extremely complicated or ineffective. A promising alternative is represented by data-driven approaches. Recently, many hydraulic engineering problems have been addressed by means of advanced models derived from artificial intelligence studies. Three different machine learning algorithms were used for spring discharge forecasting in this comparative study: M5P regression tree, random forest, and support vector regression. The spring of Rasiglia Alzabove, Umbria, Central Italy, was selected as a case study. The machine learning models have proven to be able to provide very encouraging results. M5P provides good short-term predictions of monthly average flow rates (e.g., in predicting average discharge of the spring after 1 month, R2=0.991, RAE=14.97%, if a 4-month input is considered), while RF is able to provide accurate medium-term forecasts (e.g., in forecasting average discharge of the spring after 3 months, R2=0.964, RAE=43.12%, if a 4-month input is considered). As the time of forecasting advances, the models generally provide less accurate predictions. Moreover, the effectiveness of the models significantly depends on the duration of the period considered for input data. This duration should be close to the aquifer response time, approximately estimated by cross-correlation analysis.",https://doi.org/10.1155/2018/8328167,10.1155/2018/8328167,J,"Granata, F; Saroli, M; de Marinis, G; Gargano, R",NA,NA,NA,"Granata, Francesco; Saroli, Michele; de Marinis, Giovanni; Gargano, Rudy",NA,NA,y,GEOFLUIDS,NA,NA,English,Article,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,PREDICTION; SCOUR,"[Granata, Francesco; Saroli, Michele; de Marinis, Giovanni; Gargano, Rudy] Univ Cassino & Southern Lazio, Dept Civil & Mech Engn, Via G Di Biasio 43, I-03043 Cassino, FR, Italy",NA,"Granata, F (corresponding author), Univ Cassino & Southern Lazio, Dept Civil & Mech Engn, Via G Di Biasio 43, I-03043 Cassino, FR, Italy.",f.granata@unicas.it,"Saroli, Michele MS/F-5132-2017","Saroli, Michele MS/0000-0001-9499-3960; GARGANO, Rudy/0000-0003-4409-9463; GRANATA, Francesco/0000-0002-2268-6600",NA,NA,NA,32,17,17,0,2,WILEY-HINDAWI,LONDON,"ADAM HOUSE, 3RD FL, 1 FITZROY SQ, LONDON, WIT 5HE, ENGLAND",1468-8115,1468-8123,NA,GEOFLUIDS,Geofluids,NA,2018,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,UNSP 8328167,10.1155/2018/8328167,NA,NA,13,Geochemistry & Geophysics; Geology,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),Geochemistry & Geophysics; Geology,HE9AM,WOS:000453739100001,NA,"Green Published, gold, Green Submitted",NA,NA,2/17/2022
797,Assimilation of water temperature and discharge data for ensemble water temperature forecasting,"Recent work demonstrated the value of water temperature forecasts to improve water resources allocation and highlighted the importance of quantifying their uncertainty adequately. In this study, we perform a multisite cascading ensemble assimilation of discharge and water temperature on the Nechako River (Canada) using particle filters. Hydrological and thermal initial conditions were provided to a rainfall-runoff model, coupled to a thermal module, using ensemble meteorological forecasts as inputs to produce 5 day ensemble thermal forecasts. Results show good performances of the particle filters with improvements of the accuracy of initial conditions by more than 65% compared to simulations without data assimilation for both the hydrological and the thermal component. All thermal forecasts returned continuous ranked probability scores under 0.8 degrees C when using a set of 40 initial conditions and meteorological forecasts comprising 20 members. A greater contribution of the initial conditions to the total uncertainty of the system for 1-dayforecasts is observed (mean ensemble spread = 1.1 degrees C) compared to meteorological forcings (mean ensemble spread = 0.6 degrees C). The inclusion, of meteorological uncertainty is critical to maintain reliable forecasts and proper ensemble spread for lead times of 2 days and more. This work demonstrates the ability of the particle filters to properly update the initial conditions of a coupled hydrological and thermal model and offers insights regarding the contribution of two major sources of uncertainty to the overall uncertainty in thermal forecasts.

798,Applying Geostatistics to Predict Dissolvent Oxygen (DO) in Water on the Rivers in Ho Chi Minh City,"Geostatistics is briefly concerned with estimation and prediction for spatially continuous phenomena, using data measured at a finite number of spatial locations to estimate values of interest at unmeasured locations. In practice, the costs of installing new observational stations to observe metropolitan water pollution sources, as DO (Dissolvent Oxygen), COD (Chemical Oxygen Demand) and BOD (Biochemical oxygen Demand) concentrations are economically high. In this study, spatial analysis of water pollution of 32 stations monitored during 3 years was carried out. Geostatistics which has been introduced as a management and decision tool by many researchers has been applied to reveal the spatial structure of water pollution fluctuation. In this article, author use the recorded DO concentrations (is the amount of dissolvent oxygen in water required for the respiration of aquatic organisms) at several observational stations on the rivers in Ho Chi Minh City (HCMC), employ the Kriging interpolation method to find suitable models, then predict DO concentrations at some unmeasured stations in the city. Our key contribution is finding good statistical models by several criteria, then fitting those models with high precision. From the data set, author found the best forecast model with the smallest forecast error to predict DO concentration on rivers in Ho Chi Minh City.

799,Forecasting Development of Mine Pit Lake Water Surface Levels Based on Time Series Analysis and Neural Networks,"Sustainable mine closure is one of the main priorities of the mining industry. This aim of this research was to predict the spatiotemporal development of water levels in a mined-out pit by generating forecasts of the dependent variables (rainfall and temperature) via linear (autoregressive integrated moving average) and non-linear (artificial neural network) models. We investigated natural water level development in one mined-out pit of the closed lignite mines in Amynteon, north Greece, with no artificial recharge. The forecasted rate of water level increase was estimated to be approximate to 10 m per year in the 'early' stage of pit lake spatiotemporal evolution (first 10 years), and 0.1 m per year in the 'last' stage of potential lake development (after year 2060). Also, the optimum lake surface (i.e. the level where no significant increase in water level rate appears) was estimated at + 520 m, which was predicted to occur in approximate to 40 years. The proposed methodology was validated via water level measurements performed during the first year of lake development, where field measurements of water elevations closely followed predictions. Forecasting pit lake water levels is essential for strategic planning, examining pit lake repurposing options, and informing decisions about post-mining futures and economic transitions.",https://doi.org/10.1007/s10230-021-00844-5,10.1007/s10230-021-00844-5,J,"Louloudis, G; Louloudis, E; Roumpos, C; Mertiri, E; Kasfikis, G; Chatzopoulos, K",NA,NA,NA,"Louloudis, Georgios; Louloudis, Emmanouil; Roumpos, Christos; Mertiri, Eleni; Kasfikis, Georgios; Chatzopoulos, Konstantinos",NA,NA,y,MINE WATER AND THE ENVIRONMENT,NA,NA,English,Article; Early Access,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,Mine closure; Rehabilitation; Spatiotemporal; Post-mining; Artificial neural network (ANN),STORAGE HYDROPOWER PLANTS; CLIMATE-CHANGE; TRENDS; POLICY,"[Louloudis, Georgios; Roumpos, Christos; Mertiri, Eleni; Kasfikis, Georgios; Chatzopoulos, Konstantinos] Publ Power Corp Greece, Dept Min Engn, Athens, Greece; [Louloudis, Emmanouil] Athens Univ Econ & Business, Dept Stat, Athens, Greece",NA,"Roumpos, C (corresponding author), Publ Power Corp Greece, Dept Min Engn, Athens, Greece.",g.louloudis@dei.gr; louloudis@aueb.gr; c.roumpos@dei.gr; elmertiri@gmail.com; g.kasfikis@dei.gr; k.chatzopoulos@dei.gr,NA,"Roumpos, Christos/0000-0001-9394-8041",NA,NA,NA,55,0,0,4,4,SPRINGER HEIDELBERG,HEIDELBERG,"TIERGARTENSTRASSE 17, D-69121 HEIDELBERG, GERMANY",1025-9112,1616-1068,NA,MINE WATER ENVIRON,Mine Water Environ.,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,10.1007/s10230-021-00844-5,NA,Dec-21,17,Water Resources,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),Water Resources,XI2EA,WOS:000725930600001,NA,NA,NA,NA,2/17/2022
800,Predicting field production rates for waterflooding using a machine learning-based proxy model,"Waterflooding, during which water is injected in the reservoir to increase pressure and therefore boost oil production, is extensively used as a secondary oil recovery technology. Tracking the extent and efficacy of waterflooding (i.e., fluid distributions) is a primary task of reservoir engineers and is traditionally achieved by running full reservoir models. In this work, we design and implement a proxy model using a conditional deep convolutional generative neural network (cDC-GAN), which can be used to quickly calculate the dynamic fluid distribution of a heterogeneous reservoir under waterflooding. Zero-sum game theory is the basis for the cDC-GAN, which includes a pair of generative discriminative models. The generative model tries to learn the relationship between input and output and makes the generated output as close as possible to the training data, while the discriminative model tries to distinguish the fake output and the real data used for training, such that the cDC-GAN learns the real data distribution at the end. In our cDC-GAN formulation, the reservoir properties (permeability distribution in this research) and forecast time information are treated as input, and water saturation is the desired output. The reservoir fluid production rate can be calculated based on the material balance principle. The most significant contribution of this work resides in training a cDC-GAN proxy model to accurately predict fluid saturation. A cDC-GAN has several advantages over the traditional full-model based workflow. First, the model parameters estimated from history matching help to improve reservoir characterization. Second, this proposed proxy model can predict the water and oil saturation distributions simultaneously, which can be used to calculate the water and oil flow rates. Third, this proposed proxy model can be used for waterflooding optimization and uncertainty analysis with far less computational effort than with the traditional method, which uses a reservoir simulator.",https://doi.org/10.1016/j.petrol.2020.107574,10.1016/j.petrol.2020.107574,J,"Zhong, Z; Sun, AY; Wang, YY; Ren, B",NA,NA,NA,"Zhong, Zhi; Sun, Alexander Y.; Wang, Yanyong; Ren, Bo",NA,NA,y,JOURNAL OF PETROLEUM SCIENCE AND ENGINEERING,NA,NA,English,Article,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,Machine learning; Conditional deep convolutional generative adversarial neural network; Data-driven proxy model; Waterflooding; Field production rate,RESPONSE-SURFACE METHODOLOGY; ALTERNATING-GAS-INJECTION; RELATIVE PERMEABILITY; OIL-FIELD; WORK FLOW; OPTIMIZATION; PRESSURE; DESIGN,"[Zhong, Zhi] China Univ Geosci, Key Lab Tecton & Petr Resources, Minist Educ, Wuhan 430074, Hubei, Peoples R China; [Zhong, Zhi; Sun, Alexander Y.; Wang, Yanyong; Ren, Bo] Univ Texas Austin, Jackson Sch Geosci, Bur Econ Geol, Austin, TX 78758 USA",NA,"Zhong, Z; Sun, AY (corresponding author), Univ Texas Austin, Jackson Sch Geosci, Bur Econ Geol, Austin, TX 78758 USA.",zhongzhi@cug.edu.cn; alex.sun@beg.utexas.edu,"Wang, Yanyong/Q-4898-2017; Sun, Alexander/A-9959-2011","Wang, Yanyong/0000-0003-3119-3821; Sun, Alexander/0000-0002-6365-8526",Strategic Priority Research Program of the Chinese Academy of SciencesChinese Academy of Sciences [XDA14010302],"We are grateful to the AE and four anonymous reviewers for their constructive comments.

801,Introducing a novel model and tool for design and performance forecasting of waterflood projects,"Although the waterflood process as an improved oil recovery method for increasing production and pressure maintanence has been around and widely used for more than six decades, it still holds a significant portion of world oil production. In some giant international companies, e.x. BP, about half of their production is by waterflooding. On the other hand, forecasting the performance of waterflooding projects plays an important role in successful study, design and selection of the best candidates from company reservoir asset. A model which is fast, robus, easy to use and reasonably accurate with a few input data required is of great desire. In this paper we address this deficiency by presenting a novel analytical-base forecasting model/tool that does not rely on conventional numerical simulation. Using the concepts of material balance, momentum balance, segregated flow and fractional flux (F-C or F-Phi) we achieve an analytical approach for modeling waterflooding behavior in reservoir. We used a Koval flow-storage capacity (F-C) model in the current research because of its strength and wide applicability for both homogenous and heterogeneous permeable media. The validity of the forecasting model was investigated by matching numerous actual field, single well and also simulation results. History matching showed good agreement between field data and forecasting results. The forecasting model demonstrates a strong ability to forecast the oil saturation, recovery efficiency, cumulative oil recovery, oil cut and oil rate changes with time. In addition, predicting the recovery efficiency enables us to generate the volumetric efficiency change with time which is of great importance for studying and evaluating waterflood process. These valuable results are produced using a few input data required.",https://doi.org/10.1016/j.fuel.2018.09.125,10.1016/j.fuel.2018.09.125,J,"Mollaei, A; Delshad, M",NA,NA,NA,"Mollaei, Alireza; Delshad, Mojdeh",NA,NA,y,FUEL,NA,NA,English,Article,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,Waterflooding; Predictive models; Fast performance prediction; Analytical model; Experimental design; Recovery efficiency; Volumetric sweep; Project design,NA,"[Mollaei, Alireza; Delshad, Mojdeh] Univ Texas Austin, Austin, TX 78712 USA",NA,"Mollaei, A (corresponding author), Univ Texas Austin, Austin, TX 78712 USA.",NA,NA,NA,Chevron alliance,The authors would like to acknowledge the Chevron alliance for support of this work.,NA,25,1,1,0,4,ELSEVIER SCI LTD,OXFORD,"THE BOULEVARD, LANGFORD LANE, KIDLINGTON, OXFORD OX5 1GB, OXON, ENGLAND",0016-2361,1873-7153,NA,FUEL,Fuel,1-Feb,2019,237,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,298,307,NA,10.1016/j.fuel.2018.09.125,NA,NA,10,"Energy & Fuels; Engineering, Chemical",Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),Energy & Fuels; Engineering,GY4YB,WOS:000448573200029,NA,NA,NA,NA,2/17/2022
802,"Using fuzzy cognitive maps for predicting river management responses: A case study of the Esla River basin, Spain","The planning and management of river ecosystems affects a variety of social groups (i.e., managers, stakeholders, professionals and users) who have different interests about water uses. To avoid conflicts and reach an environmentally sustainable management, various methods have been devised to enable the participation of these actors. Mathematical modelling of river systems is highly recommended to forecast, but we do not always have enough information to do it. In these cases, the soft and meta-models can be valid alternatives to simulate these complex systems. The Fuzzy Cognitive Maps (FCMs) are presented as a tool that facilitates the modelling of ecological systems, functions and services. FCM networking concepts are intertwined through causal relationships. The FCM concept spatial arrangement and the use of fuzzy logic facilitate the integration of different expert opinions. In our study, from a panel of seven experts from representatives of different social sectors, an aggregated FCM was obtained. The most central concept in the aggregated map was cross barriers, dams and weirs. Using our FCM expert model, we performed a number of simulations from different possible scenarios, such as the continuous degradation of natural conditions and the improvement of river natural conditions. A regular increment in the natural conditions generates a substantial enhance in variables as natural water flow and sediment transport. Conversely, the increment in human activities as agro-forestry production addresses to a deterioration of river banks among other variables. In the Esla River, the FCM indicators showed an ecosystem that was greatly influenced by human activity, especially by the presence of barriers, in which the economic variables presented high network influence even though their centrality indices were relatively low. Meanwhile, the essential elements for the proper functioning of this ecosystem, as a natural flow regime, showed very low values that were visibly affected by anthropogenic variables. FCM methodology enabled us not only to understand the perception of current fluvial ecosystems but also to generate plausible management scenarios based on expert knowledge in this field.

804,Multi-station streamflow forecasting using wavelet denoising and artificial intelligence models,"In this research, the hybrid of threshold based wavelet denoising with Extreme Learning Machine (ELM) and Least Square Support Vector Machine (LSSVM) models would be investigated in order to forecast Snoqualmie watershed daily Multi-Station (MS) streamflow. For this purpose, firstly, the watershed outflow was forecasted using models of ELM and LSSVM only with one station individually without any pre-processing. So, MS-ELM and MS-LSSVM were applied for using all sub-basins data synchronously. Ultimately, the sub-basins streamflow were denoised using wavelet based thresholding approach, and next, in a MS framework, the purified signals were imposed into the ELM and LSSVM models. It was obtained the ELM preference compared to the LSSVM, and MS model with compared to the individual sub-basin model, considering denoised data with respect to the noisy data, for example, DCLSSVM=0.82, DCELM=0.84, DCMS-ELM=0.90, DCdenoised-MS-ELM=0.93.

805,Ensemble Wavelet-Support Vector Machine Approach for Prediction of Suspended Sediment Load Using Hydrometeorological Data,"Explicit prediction of the suspended sediment loads in rivers or streams is very crucial for sustainable water resources and environmental systems. Suspended sediments are a governing factor for the design and operation of hydraulic structures, like canals, diversions and dams. In recent decades, to model hydrological phenomena which are complex in nature the machine learning models are used commonly. In the present study, support vector machine (SVM) with wavelet transform (WASVM) has been employed for prediction of daily suspended sediment load (SL) for two south Indian watersheds (Marol and Muneru) using hydrometeorological data. A 40-year daily observed data (1972-2011) have been used for the analysis, where past SL, streamflow (Q), and rainfall (R) data were used as the model inputs, and SL was the model output. Using conventional correlation coefficient analysis between input and output variables, the best input of WASVM model was identified. The reliability of SVM and WASVM models were evaluated on the basis of different performance criteria, i.e.,coefficient of determination (R2), root mean square error (RMSE), normalized mean square error (NMSE), and Nash-Sutcliffe coefficient (NS). Initially, 1-day ahead SL prediction was performed using the best WASVM model. The results showed that, 1-day predictions were very precise, showing a close agreement with the observed SL data (R2=0.94, NS=0.94 for the Marol watershed, and R2=0.77, NS=0.77 for the Muneru watershed) in the testing period. The same WASVM model was then used for the prediction of SL for the higher lead periods. The NMSE value for the Marol watershed was found as low as 0.06 for 1-day ahead prediction, and increases subsequently as 0.29, 0.46, and 0.70 for 3-, 6-, and 9-day higher leads, respectively. Likewise, for the Muneru watershed, the NMSE value was found as low as 0.21 for 1-day ahead prediction, and increases subsequently as 0.42, 0.53, and 0.68 for 3-, 6-, and 9-day higher leads, respectively. Further, the model was evaluated on the basis of its capability of predicting peak SL and cumulative SL for 1- to 6-day leads. The statistical analysis shows that the developed WASVM model can predict the target value successfully up to a 6-day lead and is not suitable for higher lead specifically in the selected watersheds having similar hydroclimatic conditions like the ones selected in this study. Predictions by the WASVM model were found significantly superior to the ones obtained by the conventional SVM model. The results revealed that the WASVM model provides a very good accuracy in predicting SL and can be used as an effective forecasting tool for hydrological applications.",https://doi.org/10.1061/(ASCE)HE.1943-5584.0001516,10.1061/(ASCE)HE.1943-5584.0001516,J,"Himanshu, SK; Pandey, A; Yadav, B",NA,NA,NA,"Himanshu, Sushil Kumar; Pandey, Ashish; Yadav, Basant",NA,NA,y,JOURNAL OF HYDROLOGIC ENGINEERING,NA,NA,English,Article,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,Support vector machine (SVM); Support vector machine with wavelet transform (WASVM); Suspended sediment load; Prediction; Evaluation,ARTIFICIAL NEURAL-NETWORKS; EXTREME LEARNING-MACHINE; PEDOTRANSFER FUNCTIONS; SOIL-EROSION; REGRESSION; ANN; PRECIPITATION; FUZZY; MODEL; RIVER,"[Himanshu, Sushil Kumar; Pandey, Ashish] Indian Inst Technol Roorkee, Dept Water Resources Dev & Management, Roorkee 247667, Uttarakhand, India; [Yadav, Basant] Indian Inst Technol Delhi, Dept Civil Engn, New Delhi 110016, India",NA,"Himanshu, SK (corresponding author), Indian Inst Technol Roorkee, Dept Water Resources Dev & Management, Roorkee 247667, Uttarakhand, India.",sushilkumarhimanshu@gmail.com,"Yadav, Basant/AAE-5650-2019; Pandey, Ashish/O-9479-2018; Himanshu, Sushil Kumar/J-9642-2019","Yadav, Basant/0000-0001-9780-9030; Pandey, Ashish/0000-0003-2110-8283; Himanshu, Sushil Kumar/0000-0002-9384-4864",NA,NA,NA,72,17,17,1,44,ASCE-AMER SOC CIVIL ENGINEERS,RESTON,"1801 ALEXANDER BELL DR, RESTON, VA 20191-4400 USA",1084-0699,1943-5584,NA,J HYDROL ENG,J.

806,A runoff probability density prediction method based on B-spline quantile regression and kernel density estimation,"Exact and dependable runoff forecasting plays a vital role in water resources management and utilization. This paper proposes a B-spline quantile regression probability density prediction method to predict future runoff and quantify the uncertainty of prediction. The method includes three steps. First, the B-spline function is used to perform spline processing on the runoff data. Secondly, the spline-processed training data is input into the quantile regression model to calculate the parameters of the B-spline quantile regression model, and the successfully constructed B-spline quantile regression model is combined with kernel density estimation to construct a probability density prediction method. Finally, the constructed B-spline quantile regression probability density prediction method is used to forecast future runoff flow, and quantitatively analyze the relevant prediction uncertainty. Six evaluation indicators are constructed, among which the root mean square error, the deterministic coefficient, the pass rate are the evaluation metrics of point predictions based on probability mean, median and mode; the prediction interval coverage probability, prediction interval normalized average width and continuous ranked probability score are the evaluation criteria of interval predictions and probabilistic forecasting. The presented method is able to depict the probability density curve of future runoff flow, and obtain more comprehensive information than point forecasting and interval predictions. As a case study, this method is applicable to the Shigu station of the Jinsha River in China. The results show that the results of the proposed method are better than that of existing some state-of-the-art methods. From the perspective of application, the pass rate and the deterministic coefficient of the method have reached the grade A of accuracy. Therefore, the B-spline quantile regression model provides an alternative scheme to runoff prediction. (c) 2021 Elsevier Inc.

807,Toward urban sustainability and clean potable water: Prediction of water quality via arti fi cial neural networks,"Water quality failure is a long-standing problem worldwide, causing illness, poisoning, disease outbreak, and claiming human lives in the urban communities. Potable water can be compromised due to a myriad of physical, operational, and environmental factors, such as contaminants intrusion into water pipelines, leaching, disinfection byproducts, chemical or microbial permeation, and pollution. The prediction of potable water quality has seldom been researched, while a novel automated model that offers a proactive approach can be developed to promote sustainability-based strategies. This paper elaborates the impacts of the aforementioned factors on the quality of potable water using the Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs) and risk analysis techniques. The ANN model was developed based on historical data obtained from the water distribution networks (WDNs) of the City of El Pedregal, Peru. The data were streamlined and fed to the neural network to be trained. Subsequent to multiple iterations via the scaled conjugate gradient algorithm, the optimized performance was generated and passed to the trained network to forecast the water quality failure in WDNs. The model performance was tested and validated against different statistical error terms and indicators. The mean absolute error and root-mean-squared error in the ANN failure prediction were computed as 0.08 and 0.15, whereas the average validity of the network was generated to be 92%. Based on the trained neural network, the degree of influence of each factor was determined through implementing a sensitivity analysis. It was found that water quality, water pressure, and operational and maintenance practices had the maximum influence on the risk of failure in water infrastructure. Policy makers and managers can benefit from the proposed model since ANN is already trained, by predicting water quality whenever new data become available. Prediction results will indicate the level of risk (low, moderate, high) to the inhabitants, thereby preemptive measures can be taken to avoid any illness or disease outbreak. (c) 2020 Elsevier Ltd.

808,Impact of Geology on Seasonal Hydrological Predictability in Alpine Regions by a Sensitivity Analysis Framework,"Catchment geology has a major influence on the relative impact of the main seasonal hydrological predictability sources (initial conditions (IC), climate forcing (CF)) on the forecast skill as it defines the system's persistence. A quantification of its effect, though, on the contribution of the predictability sources to the forecast skill has not been previously investigated. In this work we apply the End Point Blending (EPB) framework to assess the contribution of IC and CF to the seasonal streamflow forecast skill over two catchments that represent the end members of a set of catchments of contrasting geology, hence contrasting hydrological response: a highly-permeable, hence slow-responding catchment and a fast-responding catchment of low permeability. Our results show that the contribution of IC in the slow-responding catchment is higher by up to 44% for forecasts initialized in winter and spring and by up to 21% for forecasts initialized in summer. IC are important for up to 4 months of lead in the slow-responding catchment and 2 months of lead in the flashier catchment. Our analysis highlights the added value of the EPB in comparison to the traditional ESP/revESP approach for identifying the sources of seasonal hydrological predictability, on the basis of catchment geology.",https://doi.org/10.3390/w12082255,10.3390/w12082255,J,"Stergiadi, M; Di Marco, N; Avesani, D; Righetti, M; Borga, M",NA,NA,NA,"Stergiadi, Maria; Di Marco, Nicola; Avesani, Diego; Righetti, Maurizio; Borga, Marco",NA,NA,y,WATER,NA,NA,English,Article,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,seasonal streamflow forecast; initial conditions; sensitivity analysis,STREAMFLOW FORECAST SKILL; SOIL-MOISTURE; MODEL CALIBRATION; DATA ASSIMILATION; PREDICTION; SNOW; SIMULATION; STATES; UNCERTAINTY; SYSTEM,"[Stergiadi, Maria; Di Marco, Nicola; Avesani, Diego; Righetti, Maurizio] Free Univ Bozen Bolzano, Fac Sci & Technol, Piazza Univ 5, I-39100 Bozen Bolzano, Italy; [Borga, Marco] Univ Padua, Dept Land Environm Agr & Forestry, Viale Univ 16, I-35020 Legnaro, Italy",NA,"Stergiadi, M; Avesani, D (corresponding author), Free Univ Bozen Bolzano, Fac Sci & Technol, Piazza Univ 5, I-39100 Bozen Bolzano, Italy.",maria.stergiadi@natec.unibz.it; nicola.dimarco@unibz.it; diego.avesani@unibz.it; maurizio.righetti@unibz.it; marco.borga@unipd.it,"; borga, marco/C-6697-2014","Avesani, Diego/0000-0002-0136-5672; borga, marco/0000-0003-3435-2779","project Applied Thermo-Fluid Dynamics Laboratories, Applied Research Infrastructures for Companies and Industry in South Tyrol [FESR1029]; European Regional Development Fund (ERDF) Investment for Growth and Jobs Program 2014-2020; Autonomous Province of BolzanoPronvincia Autonoma di Bolzano","The authors would like to acknowledge the Hydrographic Office of the Autonomous Province of Bozen-Bolzano for providing meteorological and streamflow data, as well as Maria-Helena Ramos (IRSTEA, France) and Ilias Pechlivanidis (SMHI, Sweden) for early discussions and suggestions on the present work.

809,Annual Runoff Forecasting Based on Multi-Model Information Fusion and Residual Error Correction in the Ganjiang River Basin,"Accurate forecasting of annual runoff time series is of great significance for water resources planning and management. However, considering that the number of forecasting factors is numerous, a single forecasting model has certain limitations and a runoff time series consists of complex nonlinear and nonstationary characteristics, which make the runoff forecasting difficult. Aimed at improving the prediction accuracy of annual runoff time series, the principal components analysis (PCA) method is adopted to reduce the complexity of forecasting factors, and a modified coupling forecasting model based on multiple linear regression (MLR), back propagation neural network (BPNN), Elman neural network (ENN), and particle swarm optimization-support vector machine for regression (PSO-SVR) is proposed and applied in the Dongbei Hydrological Station in the Ganjiang River Basin. Firstly, from two conventional factors (i.e., rainfall, runoff) and 130 atmospheric circulation indexes (i.e., 88 atmospheric circulation indexes, 26 sea temperature indexes, 16 other indexes), principal components generated by linear mapping are screened as forecasting factors. Then, based on above forecasting factors, four forecasting models including MLR, BPNN, ENN, and PSO-SVR are developed to predict annual runoff time series. Subsequently, a coupling model composed of BPNN, ENN, and PSO-SVR is constructed by means of a multi-model information fusion taking three hydrological years (i.e., wet year, normal year, dry year) into consideration. Finally, according to residual error correction, a modified coupling forecasting model is introduced so as to further improve the accuracy of the predicted annual runoff time series in the verification period.",https://doi.org/10.3390/w12082086,10.3390/w12082086,J,"Song, PB; Liu, WF; Sun, JH; Wang, C; Kong, LZ; Nong, ZX; Lei, XH; Wang, H",NA,NA,NA,"Song, Peibing; Liu, Weifeng; Sun, Jiahui; Wang, Chao; Kong, Lingzhong; Nong, Zhenxue; Lei, Xiaohui; Wang, Hao",NA,NA,y,WATER,NA,NA,English,Article,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,annual runoff forecasting; factor selection; teleconnection factor; multi-model information fusion; residual error correction,ARTIFICIAL NEURAL-NETWORK; PRINCIPAL COMPONENT ANALYSIS; HYBRID MODEL; RAINFALL; ACCURACY; ARIMA; SVM; PREDICTION; REGRESSION; STATIONS,"[Song, Peibing; Wang, Hao] Zhejiang Univ, Coll Civil Engn & Architecture, Hangzhou 310058, Peoples R China; [Liu, Weifeng] Hohai Univ, Coll Hydrol & Water Resources, Nanjing 210098, Peoples R China; [Sun, Jiahui] Shandong Univ, Sch Civil Engn, Jinan 250061, Peoples R China; [Wang, Chao; Lei, Xiaohui; Wang, Hao] China Inst Water Resources & Hydropower Res, State Key Lab Simulat & Regulat Water Cycle River, Beijing 100038, Peoples R China; [Kong, Lingzhong] Yangzhou Univ, Coll Hydraul Sci & Engn, Yangzhou 225009, Jiangsu, Peoples R China; [Nong, Zhenxue] Guangxi Elect Power Design & Res Inst Co Ltd, China Energy Construct Grp, Nanning 530007, Peoples R China",NA,"Wang, C (corresponding author), China Inst Water Resources & Hydropower Res, State Key Lab Simulat & Regulat Water Cycle River, Beijing 100038, Peoples R China.",songpeibing@zju.edu.cn; wangchao@iwhr.com,NA,NA,National Natural Science Foundation of ChinaNational Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC) [51709275]; Young Elite Scientists Sponsorship Program by CAST [2019QNRC001]; Fundamental Research Funds of IWHR [WR0145B012020]; National Key Research and Development Plan of China [2018YFC0407405],"This research was funded by the National Natural Science Foundation of China (51709275), the Young Elite Scientists Sponsorship Program by CAST (2019QNRC001), the Fundamental Research Funds of IWHR (WR0145B012020), and the National Key Research and Development Plan of China (2018YFC0407405).",NA,51,5,5,11,22,MDPI,BASEL,"ST ALBAN-ANLAGE 66, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND",NA,2073-4441,NA,WATER-SUI,Water,AUG,2020,12,8,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,2086,10.3390/w12082086,NA,NA,19,Environmental Sciences; Water Resources,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),Environmental Sciences & Ecology; Water Resources,NH4AZ,WOS:000564615500001,NA,gold,NA,NA,2/17/2022
810,Data-driven approaches for runoff prediction using distributed data,"Accurate rainfall-runoff modelling is particularly challenging due to complex nonlinear relationships between various factors such as rainfall characteristics, soil properties, land use, and temporal lags. Recently, with improvements to computation systems and resources, data-driven models have shown good performances for runoff forecasting. However, the relative performance of common data-driven models using small temporal resolutions is still unclear. This study presents an application of data-driven models using artificial neural network, support vector regression and long-short term memory approaches and distributed forcing data for runoff predictions between 2010 and 2019 in the Russian River basin, California, USA. These models were used to predict hourly runoff with 1-6 h of lead time using precipitation, soil moisture, baseflow and land surface temperature datasets provided from the North American Land Data Assimilation System. The predicted results were evaluated in terms of seasonal and event-based performance using various statistical metrics. The results showed that the long-short term memory and support vector regression models outperforms artificial neural network model for hourly runoff forecasting, and the predictive performance of the models was greater during the wet seasons compared to the dry seasons. In addition, a comparison of the data-driven model results with the National Water Model, a fully distributed physical-based hydrologic model, showed that the long-short term memory and support vector regression models provide comparable performance. The results demonstrate that data-driven models for hourly runoff forecasting are sufficiently predictive and useful in areas where observation systems are not available.",https://doi.org/10.1007/s00477-021-01993-3,10.1007/s00477-021-01993-3,J,"Han, H; Morrison, RR",NA,NA,NA,"Han, Heechan; Morrison, Ryan R.",NA,NA,y,STOCHASTIC ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH AND RISK ASSESSMENT,NA,NA,English,Article; Early Access,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,Data-driven models; Machine learning; National Water Model; Runoff prediction,ARTIFICIAL NEURAL-NETWORKS; TERM-MEMORY NETWORKS; MANAGING UNCERTAINTY; MODEL PERFORMANCE; SOIL-MOISTURE; RAINFALL; LEVEL; STEP,"[Han, Heechan; Morrison, Ryan R.] Colorado State Univ, Dept Civil & Environm Engn, Ft Collins, CO 80523 USA",NA,"Morrison, RR (corresponding author), Colorado State Univ, Dept Civil & Environm Engn, Ft Collins, CO 80523 USA.",Ryan.Morrison@colostate.edu,"; Morrison, Ryan/K-8333-2013","Han, Heechan/0000-0002-4078-0967; Morrison, Ryan/0000-0002-8612-1684",NA,NA,NA,50,4,4,6,20,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"ONE NEW YORK PLAZA, SUITE 4600, NEW YORK, NY, UNITED STATES",1436-3240,1436-3259,NA,STOCH ENV RES RISK A,Stoch.

811,Streamflow forecasts from WRF precipitation for flood early warning in mountain tropical areas,"Numerical weather prediction (NWP) models are fundamental to extend forecast lead times beyond the concentration time of a watershed. Particularly for flash flood forecasting in tropical mountainous watersheds, forecast precipitation is required to provide timely warnings. This paper aims to assess the potential of NWP for flood early warning purposes, and the possible improvement that bias correction can provide, in a tropical mountainous area. The paper focuses on the comparison of streamflows obtained from the post-processed precipitation forecasts, particularly the comparison of ensemble forecasts and their potential in providing skilful flood forecasts. The Weather Research and Forecasting (WRF) model is used to produce precipitation forecasts that are post-processed and used to drive a hydrologic model. Discharge forecasts obtained from the hydrological model are used to assess the skill of the WRF model. The results show that post-processed WRF precipitation adds value to the flood early warning system when compared to zero-precipitation forecasts, although the precipitation forecast used in this analysis showed little added value when compared to climatology. However, the reduction of biases obtained from the post-processed ensembles show the potential of this method and model to provide usable precipitation forecasts in tropical mountainous watersheds. The need for more detailed evaluation of the WRF model in the study area is highlighted, particularly the identification of the most suitable parameterisation, due to the inability of the model to adequately represent the convective precipitation found in the study area.",https://doi.org/10.5194/hess-22-853-2018,10.5194/hess-22-853-2018,J,"Rogelis, MC; Werner, M",NA,NA,NA,"Rogelis, Maria Carolina; Werner, Micha",NA,NA,y,HYDROLOGY AND EARTH SYSTEM SCIENCES,NA,NA,English,Article,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,BIAS CORRECTION; QUANTILE REGRESSION; MODEL; RAINFALL; IMPACT; RIVER; DECOMPOSITION; UNCERTAINTY; UTILITY; TRMM,"[Rogelis, Maria Carolina; Werner, Micha] UNESCO IHE, POB 3015, NL-2601 DA Delft, Netherlands; [Werner, Micha] Deltares, POB 177, NL-2600 MH Delft, Netherlands",NA,"Rogelis, MC (corresponding author), UNESCO IHE, POB 3015, NL-2601 DA Delft, Netherlands.",c.rogelisprada@unesco-ihe.org,"Werner, Micha/C-8144-2009","Werner, Micha/0000-0003-4198-5638",UNESCO-IHE Partnership Research Fund - UPARF,"This work was funded by the UNESCO-IHE Partnership Research Fund - UPARF in the framework of the FORESEE project.

812,Time series forecasting of river flow using an integrated approach of wavelet multi-resolution analysis and evolutionary data-driven models. A case study: Sebaou River (Algeria),"The complexity of hydrological processes and lack of data for modeling require the use of specific tools for non-linear natural phenomenon. In this paper, an effort has been made to develop a conjunction model - wavelet transformation, data-driven models, and genetic algorithm (GA) - for forecasting the daily flow of a river in northern Algeria using the time series of runoff. This catchment has a semi-arid climate and strong variability in runoff. The original time series was decomposed into multi-frequency time series by wavelet transform algorithm and used as inputs to artificial neural networks (ANN) and adaptive neuro-fuzzy inference system (ANFIS) models. Several factors must be optimized to determine the best model structures. Wavelet-based data-driven models using a GA are designed to optimize model structure. The performances of wavelet-based data-driven models (i.e. WANFIS and WANN) were superior to those of conventional models. WANFIS (RMSE=12.15m(3)/s, EC=87.32%, R=.934) and WANN (RMSE=15.73m(3)/s, EC=78.83%, R=.888) models improved the performances of ANFIS (RMSE=23.13m(3)/s, EC=54.11%, R=.748) and ANN (RMSE=22.43m(3)/s, EC=56.90%, R=.755) during the test period.",https://doi.org/10.1080/02723646.2018.1429245,10.1080/02723646.2018.1429245,J,"Zakhrouf, M; Bouchelkia, H; Stamboul, M; Kim, S; Heddam, S",NA,NA,NA,"Zakhrouf, Mousaab; Bouchelkia, Hamid; Stamboul, Madani; Kim, Sungwon; Heddam, Salim",NA,NA,y,PHYSICAL GEOGRAPHY,NA,NA,English,Article,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,Time series forecasting; wavelet transform; artificial neural networks; adaptive neuro-fuzzy inference system; genetic algorithm; Algeria,FUZZY INFERENCE SYSTEM; ARTIFICIAL-INTELLIGENCE MODELS; GENETIC ALGORITHM; MONTHLY STREAMFLOW; CROSS-VALIDATION; NEURAL-NETWORK; PRECIPITATION; PREDICTION; DECOMPOSITION; TRANSFORM,"[Zakhrouf, Mousaab; Bouchelkia, Hamid] Univ Tlemcen, Dept Hydraul, Fac Technol, URMER Lab, Tilimsen, Algeria; [Stamboul, Madani] Amar Telidji Univ, Dept Civil Engn, Fac Architecture & Civil Engn, Res Lab Water Resources Soil & Environm, Laghouat, Algeria; [Kim, Sungwon] Dongyang Univ, Dept Railrd Construct & Safety Engn, Yeongju, South Korea; [Heddam, Salim] Univ 20 Aout 1955, Hydraul Div, Fac Sci, Dept Agron, Skikda, Algeria",NA,"Zakhrouf, M (corresponding author), Univ Tlemcen, Dept Hydraul, Fac Technol, URMER Lab, Tilimsen, Algeria.",mousaab@gmail.com,"HEDDAM, SALIM/B-8647-2015","HEDDAM, SALIM/0000-0002-8055-8463",NA,NA,NA,45,13,13,1,11,TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD,ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OR14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0272-3646,1930-0557,NA,PHYS GEOGR,Phys.

813,"Droughts in Amazonia: Spatiotemporal Variability, Teleconnections, and Seasonal Predictions","Most Amazonia drought studies have focused on rainfall deficits and their impact on river discharges, while the analysis of other important driver variables, such as temperature and soil moisture, has attracted less attention. Here we try to better understand the spatiotemporal dynamics of Amazonia droughts and associated climate teleconnections as characterized by the Palmer Drought Severity Index (PDSI), which integrates information from rainfall deficit, temperature anomalies, and soil moisture capacity. The results reveal that Amazonia droughts are most related to one dominant pattern across the entire region, followed by two seesaw kind of patterns: north-south and east-west. The main two modes are correlated with sea surface temperature (SST) anomalies in the tropical Pacific and Atlantic oceans. The teleconnections associated with global SST are then used to build a seasonal forecast model for PDSI over Amazonia based on predictors obtained from a sparse canonical correlation analysis approach. A unique feature of the presented drought prediction method is using only a few number of predictors to avoid excessive noise in the predictor space. Cross-validated results show correlations between observed and predicted spatial average PDSI up to 0.60 and 0.45 for lead times of 5 and 9 months, respectively. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study in the region that, based on cross-validation results, leads to appreciable forecast skills for lead times beyond 4 months. This is a step forward in better understanding the dynamics of Amazonia droughts and improving risk assessment and management, through improved drought forecasting.",https://doi.org/10.1002/2016WR020086,10.1002/2016WR020086,J,"Lima, CHR; AghaKouchak, A",NA,NA,NA,"Lima, Carlos H.

814,A Novel Runoff Forecasting Model Based on the Decomposition-Integration-Prediction Framework,"Runoff forecasting is of great importance for flood mitigation and power generation plan preparation. To explore the better application of time-frequency decomposition technology in runoff forecasting and improve the prediction accuracy, this research has developed a framework of runoff forecasting named Decomposition-Integration-Prediction (DIP) using parallel-input neural network, and proposed a novel runoff forecasting model with Variational Mode Decomposition (VMD), Gated Recurrent Unit (GRU), and Stochastic Fractal Search (SFS) algorithm under this framework. In this model, the observed runoff series is first decomposed into several sub-series via the VMD method to extract different frequency information. Secondly, the parallel layers in the parallel-input neural network based on GRU are trained to receive the input samples of each subcomponent and integrate their output adaptively through the concatenation layers. Finally, the output of concatenation layers is treated as the final runoff forecasting result. In this process, the SFS algorithm was adopted to optimize the structure of the neural network. The prediction performance of the proposed model was evaluated using the historical monthly runoff data at Pingshan and Yichang hydrological stations in the Upper Yangtze River Basin of China, and seven various single and decomposition-based hybrid models were developed for comparison.

815,A Parsimonious Empirical Approach to Streamflow Recession Analysis and Forecasting,"For more than a century, the study of streamflow recession has been dominated by seemingly physically based parametric methods that make assumptions on the nonlinear nature of the hydrograph recession. In practice, several studies have shown that various degrees of nonlinearity occur in the same time series and that parametric methods can underfit nonlinear recession patterns. As a result, these methods are often applied empirically to each recession segment. We propose a parsimonious data-driven model, EDM-Simplex, with two objectives: forecasting recession and characterizing its nonlinear behavior. We evaluate the new model through a global sensitivity analysis applied to three distinctive hydrograph series from a heterogeneous karstic catchment. The results show excellent 1-day-ahead forecasting performance (median Nash and Sutcliffe efficiency > 0.99) for all time series with four recession extraction methods. The sensitivity analysis also showed that empirical nonlinearity, that is, sensitivity to initial conditions, is best estimated through the absolute forecast performance and its decline over time. This indicator leads to different interpretations of nonlinearity compared to previous methods but is just as sensitive to the choice of recession extraction method. In particular, when forecasts were made for recession segments containing early stages of recession or flow anomalies, the upstream recession was significantly more linear than the downstream recession hydrographs affected by the karst. Consequently, our results support future research to interpret observed nonlinearities as a function of the catchment hydrological states for better integration of empirical, physical-based, and operational approaches to recession analysis.",https://doi.org/10.1029/2019WR025771,10.1029/2019WR025771,J,"Delforge, D; Munoz-Carpena, R; Van Camp, M; Vanclooster, M",NA,NA,NA,"Delforge, Damien; Munoz-Carpena, Rafael; Van Camp, Michel; Vanclooster, Marnik",NA,NA,y,WATER RESOURCES RESEARCH,NA,NA,English,Article,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,streamflow recession analysis; data-driven models; nonlinear dynamics; karst,BASEFLOW RECESSION; FLOW RECESSION; DYNAMICS; STORAGE; CLASSIFICATION; HYDROGRAPHS; ALGORITHMS; GEOMETRY; MODELS; SCALE,"[Delforge, Damien; Vanclooster, Marnik] Catholic Univ Louvain, Earth & Life Inst, Louvain La Neuve, Belgium; [Delforge, Damien; Van Camp, Michel] Royal Observ Belgium, Brussels, Belgium; [Munoz-Carpena, Rafael] Univ Florida, Dept Agr & Biol Engn, Gainesville, FL USA",NA,"Delforge, D (corresponding author), Catholic Univ Louvain, Earth & Life Inst, Louvain La Neuve, Belgium.; Delforge, D (corresponding author), Royal Observ Belgium, Brussels, Belgium.",damien.delforge@uclouvain.be,"Van+Camp, Michel/ABE-5941-2020; Van Camp, M/L-7281-2015; Munoz-Carpena, Rafael/A-7588-2010","Van Camp, M/0000-0002-2859-3122; Vanclooster, Marnik/0000-0003-1358-8723; Munoz-Carpena, Rafael/0000-0003-2838-1514; Delforge, Damien/0000-0002-3552-9444",Fonds de la Recherche Scientifique-FNRS (Belgium)Fonds de la Recherche Scientifique - FNRS,"Damien Delforge is FRIA grantee of the Fonds de la Recherche Scientifique-FNRS (Belgium).

816,A new intelligence approach based on GIS-based Multivariate Adaptive Regression Splines and metaheuristic optimization for predicting flash flood susceptible areas at high-frequency tropical typhoon area,"The main objective of this research work was to propose and verify a new soft computing approach based on Multivariate Adaptive Regression Splines (MARS) and Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) for spatial prediction of flash flood susceptible areas. A high frequency tropical typhoon area located on Northwest of Vietnam was selected as a case study. For this purpose, a GIS database for the study areas was prepared, including 654 flash-flood inundations and 12 influencing variables (elevation, slope, curvature, toposhade, aspect, topographic wetness index, stream power index, stream density, Normalized Difference Vegetation Index, soil type, lithology, and rainfall), which were compiled from various sources. The database was used to build and verify the prediction model. We assessed the model's performance through various indices including Classification Accuracy Rate, Area under the Curve (AUC), Precision, and Recall. We also compared the model's usability with five state-of-the-art machine learning techniques including the Backpropagation Neural Network, Support Vector Machine, and Classification Tree. The results revealed that the hybrid PSO-MARS model outperformed other benchmark models in all the employed statistical measures. We conclude that the proposed model can be particularly suited for flash flood forecasting problems at high frequency tropical typhoon area.",https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jhydrol.2019.05.046,10.1016/j.jhydrol.2019.05.046,J,"Bui, DT; Hoang, ND; Pham, TD; Ngo, PTT; Hoa, PV; Minh, NQ; Tran, XT; Samui, P",NA,NA,NA,"Dieu Tien Bui; Nhat-Duc Hoang; Tien-Dat Pham; Phuong-Thao Thi Ngo; Pham Viet Hoa; Nguyen Quang Minh; Xuan-Truong Tran; Samui, Pijush",NA,NA,y,JOURNAL OF HYDROLOGY,NA,NA,English,Article,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,Multivariate Adaptive Regression Splines; Particle Swarm Optimization; Flash flood susceptibility mapping; GIS,SUPPORT VECTOR MACHINE; FUZZY INFERENCE SYSTEM; SPATIAL PREDICTION; DISCRIMINANT-ANALYSIS; RISK-MANAGEMENT; URBAN AREAS; MODEL; FRAMEWORK; CLIMATE; SOIL,"[Dieu Tien Bui] Duy Tan Univ, Inst Res & Dev, Da Nang 550000, Vietnam; [Nhat-Duc Hoang] Duy Tan Univ, Inst Res & Dev, Fac Civil Engn, Da Nang, Vietnam; [Tien-Dat Pham] RIKEN Ctr Adv Intelligence Project AIP, Geoinformat Unit, Chuo Ku, Mitsui Bldg,15th Floor,1-4-1 Nihonbashi, Tokyo 1030027, Japan; [Phuong-Thao Thi Ngo] Hanoi Univ Min & Geol, Fac Informat Technol, 18 Pho Vien, Hanoi, Vietnam; [Pham Viet Hoa] Vietnam Acad Sci & Technol, Ho Chi Minh City Inst Resources Geog, Mac Dinh Chi 1,1 Dist, Ho Chi Minh City 700000, Vietnam; [Nguyen Quang Minh; Xuan-Truong Tran] Hanoi Univ Min & Geol, Fac Geomat & Land Adm, 18 Pho Vien, Hanoi, Vietnam; [Samui, Pijush] Ton Duc Thang Univ, Geog Informat Sci Res Grp, Ho Chi Minh City, Vietnam; [Samui, Pijush] Ton Duc Thang Univ, Fac Environm & Labour Safety, Ho Chi Minh City, Vietnam",NA,"Samui, P (corresponding author), Ton Duc Thang Univ, Geog Informat Sci Res Grp, Ho Chi Minh City, Vietnam.",pijush.samui@tdtu.edu.vn,"Hoang, Nhat Duc/AAD-8621-2019; Pham, Tien Dat/N-9821-2017; samui, pijush/W-5860-2019","Pham, Tien Dat/0000-0002-6422-2847; Thi Phuong Thao, Ngo/0000-0002-6574-5762","National Foundation of Science and Technology Development (NAFOSTED), Vietnam [105.99-2014.25]","This work was supported by the National Foundation of Science and Technology Development (NAFOSTED), Vietnam, under the project 105.99-2014.25.",NA,100,29,29,5,22,ELSEVIER,AMSTERDAM,"RADARWEG 29, 1043 NX AMSTERDAM, NETHERLANDS",0022-1694,1879-2707,NA,J HYDROL,J.

817,A comprehensive comparison of four input variable selection methods for artificial neural network flow forecasting models,"Artificial neural networks (ANNs) are increasingly used for flood forecasting. The performance of these models relies on the selection of appropriate inputs. However, Input Variable Selection (IVS) is typically performed using expert knowledge or simple linear methods. This research compares and evaluates four IVS methods including two model-free methods: partial correlation (PC), partial mutual information (PMI), and two novel model-based methods: an improved input omission (IO), and improved combined neural pathway strength (CNPS). A comprehensive comparison of performance efficacy for multiple IVS methods has not been published in literature before. Each method is used for daily and hourly lead times in the Bow and Don Rivers (both in Canada), respectively. These watersheds represent different hydrological systems and were selected to highlight the performance of the IVS methods under differing conditions. This research determines that the proposed CNPS produces the strongest performing ANNs based on the robustness of the inputs selected, comparison to other IVS methods, and models developed without IVS. Additionally, this research demonstrates that standard termination criteria do not reliably identify the optimum number of inputs for the ANNs and using a model-based optimization of inputs is recommended. As a result, it is recommended that the number of inputs be determined using a systematic approach, where each input selection is informed by an IVS-based input ranking, rather than a predefined termination criterion. Lastly, this research demonstrates that input usefulness is not binary concept; the correct number of selected inputs is dependant on the desired model complexity, instead of an arbitrarily selected IVS termination criteria.",https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jhydrol.2019.124299,10.1016/j.jhydrol.2019.124299,J,"Snieder, E; Shakir, R; Khan, UT",NA,NA,NA,"Snieder, E.; Shakir, R.; Khan, U.

818,Long short-term memory (LSTM) recurrent neural network for low-flow hydrological time series forecasting,"This article explores the suitability of a long short-term memory recurrent neural network (LSTM-RNN) and artificial intelligence (AI) method for low-flow time series forecasting. The long short-term memory works on the sequential framework which considers all of the predecessor data. This forecasting method used daily discharged data collected from the Basantapur gauging station located on the Mahanadi River basin, India. Different metrics [root-mean-square error (RMSE), Nash-Sutcliffe efficiency (E-NS), correlation coefficient (R) and mean absolute error] were selected to assess the performance of the model. Additionally, recurrent neural network (RNN) model is also used to compare the adaptability of LSTM-RNN over RNN and naive method. The results conclude that the LSTM-RNN model (R = 0.943, E-NS = 0.878, RMSE = 0.487) outperformed RNN model (R = 0.935, E-NS = 0.843, RMSE = 0.516) and naive method (R = 0.866, E-NS = 0.704, RMSE = 0.793).

819,Stream Flow Forecasting in Mahanadi River Basin using Artificial Neural Networks,"Suspended sediment prediction is essential for wearing awayof soil and sedimentation at time of peakinundation period. Several kinds of neural networks have been projected in preceding papers for applications in hydrological events. This research intelligence focuses on assessment of applicability of Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) and Radial Basis Function Network (RBFN) for forecasting flow on daily basis at gauging station in Mahanadi river basin. Superlative performance is assessed on basis of RMSE, R-2 which was attained by the precipitation and antecedent flow as model inputs. Based on performance value RNN gives prominent value as compare to RBFN. In case of RBFN three transfer function Tan-sig, Log-sig, purelin are utilized for evaluating model performance. While Tan-sig function used model gives extent value of R-2 that is0.9614 and 0.9843 for training and testing phase respectively. (C) 2019 The Authors. Published by Elsevier B.V.

820,Skill of Hydrological Extended Range Forecasts for Water Resources Management in Switzerland,"There is a growing need for reliable medium to extended range hydrological forecasts in water and environmental management (e.g. hydro-power and agricultural production). The objective of this paper is a first assessment of the skill of hydrological forecasts based on Numerical Weather Predictions (NWPs) in comparison to the skill of forecasts based on climatology for monthly forecasts with daily resolutions and to identify possibilities of improvement by post-processing the hydrological forecasts. Various hydrological relevant model variables, such as the surface and subsurface runoff and the soil water content, will be analysed for entire Switzerland. The spatially aggregated predictions of these variables are compared to daily simulations and to long-term daily averages of simulations driven by meteorological observations (i.e. climatology). Besides this comparison of forecasts with simulations for model variables without direct measurements available, the skill of the monthly stream-flow forecasts is estimated at four catchments with discharge measurements. Additionally post-processing methods have been applied to remove bias and dispersion errors and to estimate the predictive uncertainty of the stream-flow. Some results of various verification measures like variants of the Geometric Mean for ratios of spatial aggregates and the Continuous Rank Probability Skill Score (CRPSS) will be shown. Apart from the indication of a strong diversity of upper limits of the forecast skill depending on catchment characteristics, the results of NWPs are generally superior to climatological predictions and could be applied gainfully for various kinds of long-term water management planning.",https://doi.org/10.1007/s11269-017-1849-5,10.1007/s11269-017-1849-5,J,"Bogner, K; Liechti, K; Bernhard, L; Monhart, S; Zappa, M",NA,NA,NA,"Bogner, Konrad; Liechti, Katharina; Bernhard, Luzi; Monhart, Samuel; Zappa, Massimiliano",NA,NA,y,WATER RESOURCES MANAGEMENT,NA,NA,English,Article,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,Ensemble forecasts; Extended-range; Skill score,ENSEMBLE PREDICTION SYSTEM; QUANTILE REGRESSION; MODEL; UNCERTAINTY; PERFORMANCE; DROUGHTS,"[Bogner, Konrad; Liechti, Katharina; Bernhard, Luzi; Monhart, Samuel; Zappa, Massimiliano] Swiss Fed Inst Forest Snow & Landscape Res WSL, Birmensdorf, Switzerland",NA,"Bogner, K (corresponding author), Swiss Fed Inst Forest Snow & Landscape Res WSL, Birmensdorf, Switzerland.",konrad.bogner@wsl.ch,"Zappa, Massimiliano/AAY-3821-2020; Zappa, Massimiliano/C-1205-2009; Bernhard, Luzi/AAM-6385-2021","Zappa, Massimiliano/0000-0002-2837-8190; Zappa, Massimiliano/0000-0002-2837-8190; , Konrad/0000-0002-4361-7751",Swiss National Research Programme on Sustainable Water Management [NRP 61]; Swiss Federal Office for Environment; WSL; MeteoSwiss; Commission for Technology and Innovation (CTI); NRP 70 - Energy Turnaround project [407040_153929],The application www.drought.ch is a product of the DROUGHT-CH project financed by Swiss National Research Programme on Sustainable Water Management (NRP 61).

821,Chaotic time series prediction based on robust extreme learning machine,"Chaos is seemingly irregular and analogous to random movement happening in a determinative system in nature, and more and more types and numbers of time series with chaotic characteristics are obtained from the actual systems, such as atmospheric circulation, temperature, rainfall, sunspots, and the Yellow River flow. The chaotic time series prediction has become a research hotspot in recent years. Because neural network can be strongly approximated nonlinearly, it has better prediction performance in the chaotic time series modeling. Extreme learning machine is a kind of neural network, and it is widely used due to its simple structure, high learning efficiency and having global optimal solution. Extreme learning machine initializes the input weight randomly and just adjusts the output weight in the training process, in order to be able to obtain the global optimal solution, so it has faster convergence speed and can overcome the disadvantage of gradient vanishing. Due to the above advantages, in recent years, the improved algorithms of the extreme learning machine have been developed rapidly. However, the traditional training methods of extreme learning machine have very poor robustness and can be affected easily by noise and outliers. And in practical applications, the time series are often contaminated by noise and outliers, so it is important to improve the forecasting model robustness and reduce the influence of noise and abnormal points to obtain better prediction accuracy. In this paper, a robust extreme learning machine is proposed in a Bayesian framework to solve the problem that outliers exist in the training data set. Firstly, the input samples are mapped onto the high-dimensional space, and the output weight of the extreme learning machine is used as the parameter to be estimated, then the proposed model utilizes the more robust Gaussian mixture distribution as the likelihood function of the model output. The marginal likelihood of the model output is analytically intractable for the Gaussian mixture distribution, so a variational procedure is introduced to realize the parameter estimation. In the cases of different noise levels and the different numbers of outliers, the proposed model is compared with the other prediction models. The experimental results of Lorenz, Rossler and Sunspot-Runoff in the Yellow River time series with outliers and noise demonstrate that the proposed robust extreme learning machine model could obtain a better prediction accuracy. The proposed robust extreme learning machine not only has the strong capability of the nonlinear approximation but also can learn the model parameters automatically and has strong robustness.

822,APPLICATION OF ARTIFICIAL NEURAL NETWORK TO FORECAST THE WATER LEVEL AT XUAN QUAN CULVERT IN VIETNAM,"Artificial intelligence is increasingly widely used in many different areas of life, including irrigation. In recent years, Machine learning and Artificial neural networks (ANN) models are excellent tools for forecasting flow rate in the river or the water levels at irrigation culverts to help the operation of the sluice gates be appropriate and effective. In this study, a simple and efficient model based on ANN is suggested for water level prediction at Xuan Quan culvert in Vietnam for 6 hours, 12 hours, 18 hours and 24 hours of lead time. The input data needed for prediction are observed water levels in the upstream and downstream of the Xuan Quan culvert, from 2003 to 2018. Although the model does not require a lot of data, the forecasted results are highly accurate. The Nash-Sutcliffe efficiency (NSE) reaches 97% - 99% for all forecasting cases. This result shows that the ANN model proposed by the research team accurately predicts water levels in real time, furthermore, this model can be applied to forecast water levels at other irrigation sluice gates.",https://doi.org/10.1007/978-981-15-0291-0_95,10.1007/978-981-15-0291-0_95,C,"Hoang, TV; Huong, DM; Huy, TD; Ho, HV",NA,"Viet, NT; Xiping, D; Tung, TT",NA,Truong Viet Hoang; Doan Mai Huong; Tran Duc Huy; Hung Viet Ho,NA,NA,y,"PROCEEDINGS OF THE 10TH INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE ON ASIAN AND PACIFIC COASTS, APAC 2019",NA,NA,English,Proceedings Paper,10th International Conference on Asian and Pacific Coasts (APAC),"SEP 25-28, 2019","Thuyloi Univ, Hanoi, VIETNAM","NAFOSTED, LONG THANH, FECON, LICOGI 16, SHENLIAN",Thuyloi Univ,ANN; LSTM; Xuan Quan; water level; forecast,NA,"[Truong Viet Hoang; Doan Mai Huong; Tran Duc Huy] Thuyloi Univ, Dept Adv Program, 175 Tayson St, Hanoi, Vietnam; [Hung Viet Ho] Thuyloi Univ, Fac Water Resources Engn, 175 Tayson St, Hanoi, Vietnam",NA,"Hoang, TV (corresponding author), Thuyloi Univ, Dept Adv Program, 175 Tayson St, Hanoi, Vietnam.",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,9,0,0,0,0,SPRINGER-VERLAG SINGAPORE PTE LTD,SINGAPORE,"152 BEACH ROAD, #21-01/04 GATEWAY EAST, SINGAPORE, 189721, SINGAPORE",NA,NA,978-981-15-0291-0; 978-981-15-0290-3,NA,NA,NA,2020,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,695,701,NA,10.1007/978-981-15-0291-0_95,NA,NA,7,"Engineering, Ocean; Environmental Sciences; Meteorology & Atmospheric Sciences",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S),Engineering; Environmental Sciences & Ecology; Meteorology & Atmospheric Sciences,BP4TQ,WOS:000554412700095,NA,NA,NA,NA,2/17/2022
823,"A Theoretical Approach for Forecasting Different Types of Drought Simultaneously, Using Entropy Theory and Machine-Learning Methods","Precipitation deficit can affect different natural resources such as water, soil, rivers and plants, and cause meteorological, hydrological and agricultural droughts. Multivariate drought indexes can theoretically show the severity and weakness of various drought types simultaneously. This study introduces an approach for forecasting joint deficit index (JDI) and multivariate standardized precipitation index (MSPI) by using machine-learning methods and entropy theory. JDI and MSPI were calculated for the 1-12 months' time window (JDI(1-12) and MSPI1-12), using monthly precipitation data. The methods implemented for forecasting are group method of data handling (GMDH), generalized regression neural network (GRNN), least squared support vector machine (LSSVM), adaptive neuro-fuzzy inference system (ANFIS) and ANFIS optimized with three heuristic optimization algorithms, differential evolution (DE), genetic algorithm (GA) and particle swarm optimization (PSO) as meta-innovative methods (ANFIS-DE, ANFIS-GA and ANFIS-PSO). Monthly precipitation, monthly temperature and previous amounts of the index's values were used as inputs to the models. Data from 10 synoptic stations situated in the widest climatic zone of Iran (extra arid-cold climate) were employed. Optimal model inputs were selected by gamma test and entropy theory. The evaluation results, which were given using mean absolute error (MAE), root mean squared error (RMSE) and Willmott index (WI), show that the machine learning and meta-innovative models can present acceptable forecasts of general drought's conditions. The algorithms DE, GA and PSO, could improve the ANFIS's performance by 39.4%, 38.7% and 22.6%, respectively. Among all the applied models, the GMDH shows the best forecasting accuracy with MAE = 0.280, RMSE = 0.374 and WI = 0.955. In addition, the models could forecast MSPI better than JDI in the majority of cases (stations). Among the two methods used to select the optimal inputs, it is difficult to select one as a better input selector, but according to the results, more attention can be paid to entropy theory in drought studies.",https://doi.org/10.3390/ijgi9120701,10.3390/ijgi9120701,J,"Aghelpour, P; Mohammadi, B; Biazar, SM; Kisi, O; Sourmirinezhad, Z",NA,NA,NA,"Aghelpour, Pouya; Mohammadi, Babak; Biazar, Seyed Mostafa; Kisi, Ozgur; Sourmirinezhad, Zohreh",NA,NA,y,ISPRS INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF GEO-INFORMATION,NA,NA,English,Article,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,entropy theory; drought forecasting; multivariate standardized precipitation index; joint deficit index; machine learning; heuristic optimization algorithms,SUPPORT VECTOR REGRESSION; STANDARDIZED PRECIPITATION; CLIMATE INDEXES; NEURAL-NETWORK; DATA SELECTION; RIVER-BASIN; PREDICTION; OPTIMIZATION; ALGORITHMS; MODELS,"[Aghelpour, Pouya; Sourmirinezhad, Zohreh] Bu Ali Sina Univ, Fac Agr, Dept Water Engn, Hamadan 6517838695, Hamadan, Iran; [Mohammadi, Babak] Hohai Univ, Coll Hydrol & Water Resources, Nanjing 210098, Peoples R China; [Biazar, Seyed Mostafa] Univ Tabriz, Fac Agr, Dept Water Engn, Tabriz 5166616471, Iran; [Kisi, Ozgur] Ilia State Univ, Dept Civil Engn, GE-0162 Tbilisi, Georgia; [Kisi, Ozgur] Duy Tan Univ, Inst Res & Dev, Da Nang 550000, Vietnam",NA,"Mohammadi, B (corresponding author), Hohai Univ, Coll Hydrol & Water Resources, Nanjing 210098, Peoples R China.",p.aghelpour@agr.basu.ac.ir; babak@hhu.edu.cn; SM.Biazar@tabrizu.ac.ir; ozgur.kisi@iliauni.edu.ge; z.sourmirinezhad@agr.basu.ac.ir,"Aghelpour, Pouya/AAQ-3174-2020; Biazar, Seyed Mostafa/P-8441-2018; Mohammadi, Babak/G-4012-2018","Aghelpour, Pouya/0000-0002-5640-865X; Biazar, Seyed Mostafa/0000-0002-8596-2051; Mohammadi, Babak/0000-0001-8427-5965; Kisi, Ozgur/0000-0001-7847-5872; Sourmirinezhad, Zohreh/0000-0002-4974-0574",NA,NA,NA,58,11,11,1,3,MDPI,BASEL,"ST ALBAN-ANLAGE 66, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND",NA,2220-9964,NA,ISPRS INT J GEO-INF,ISPRS Int.

824,Optimization of fuzzy membership function of runoff forecasting error based on the optimal closeness,"The forecasted runoff is an important input data for the daily operation of hydropower station, and the forecast accuracy directly affects its operation efficiency. However, the forecasting error is inevitable, and it is influenced by the input, the structural parameters and many human factors, it is not only random, but also has great fuzziness. Therefore, it is very important to study the fuzziness of runoff forecasting error and reveal its fuzzy distribution law to guide the actual operation of hydropower station. In view of this, this paper has carried out research work in the following two aspects. At the theoretical level, in order to make the establishment of fuzzy set more objective and scientific, based on different theoretical fuzzy distribution functions and the parameter optimization method, an overall framework of fuzzy membership function optimization model is proposed by coupling the optimal closeness criterion, which can make full use of the guiding role of practical experience and at the same time effectively avoid the difficulty of subjective choice. At the practical level, in order to quantify the fuzzy characteristics of runoff forecasting error, a quantification method for runoff forecasting error in fuzzy environment is proposed based on the Hamming closeness, Cauchy distribution, Normal distribution and Cusp Gamma distribution. Taking the Jinxi hydropower station of Yalong River basin as the research object, the fuzzy membership functions of the fuzzy sets of runoff forecasting error under different flow intervals are calculated and optimized by the proposed method. The results show that the optimized Cusp r distribution can fit the actual data points better compared with Cauchy distribution and Normal distribution, and its average closeness can reach 0.979. So, the accurate mathematical expression of the fuzzy distribution law of runoff forecasting error under different flow intervals is well realized, which provides a good basis for the fuzzy risk analysis of hydropower station operation.",https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jhydrol.2019.01.009,10.1016/j.jhydrol.2019.01.009,J,"Jiang, ZQ; Wu, WJ; Qin, H; Hu, DC; Zhang, HR",NA,NA,NA,"Jiang, Zhiqiang; Wu, Wenjie; Qin, Hui; Hu, Dechao; Zhang, Hairong",NA,NA,y,JOURNAL OF HYDROLOGY,NA,NA,English,Article,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,Runoff; Forecasting error; Fuzziness; Membership function; Fuzzy closeness,RISK ANALYSIS; RAINFALL; SYSTEM; MODEL; OPERATION,"[Jiang, Zhiqiang; Qin, Hui; Hu, Dechao] Huazhong Univ Sci & Technol, Sch Hydropower & Informat Engn, Wuhan 430074, Hubei, Peoples R China; [Wu, Wenjie] Changjiang Survey Planning Design & Res CO LTD, Wuhan 430015, Hubei, Peoples R China; [Zhang, Hairong] China Yangtze Power Co Ltd, Yichang 443133, Peoples R China",NA,"Jiang, ZQ (corresponding author), Huazhong Univ Sci & Technol, Sch Hydropower & Informat Engn, Wuhan 430074, Hubei, Peoples R China.",zqjzq@hust.edu.cn,NA,NA,"Natural Science Foundation of ChinaNational Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC) [51809098, 91647114]; National Key R&D Program of China [2017YFC0405900]; CRSRI Open Research Program [SN: CKWV2016371/KY]; Fundamental Research Funds for the Central UniversitiesFundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities [HUST: 2017KFYXJJ 198, HUST: 2016YXZD047]","This study was financially supported by the Natural Science Foundation of China (51809098; 91647114), the National Key R&D Program of China (2017YFC0405900), the CRSRI Open Research Program (Program SN: CKWV2016371/KY), and the Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities (HUST: 2017KFYXJJ 198 and HUST: 2016YXZD047).

825,Improving Artificial Neural Network Based Streamflow Forecasting Models through Data Preprocessing,"The real time hydrological data may contain noise, missing information and deviation from its original scale due to complex and nonlinear nature of hydrological processes. The data when used as it is in hydrological forecasting may create uncertainty in hydrological models, especially in data-driven models which fully rely upon the input-output data. The current research provides a simple preprocessing approach to improve the performance of ANN-based streamflow estimation models through providing a better input state. The two-step preprocessing approach includes; the data transformation through a family of power transformation, the Box-Cox transformation, and the selection of appropriate input variables through the Gamma Test. The original data, which is essentially antecedent upland catchment information of thirteen stations located in Upper Indus Basin (UIB), comprises of twenty inputs, including precipitation, solar radiation and discharge. The Box-Cox transformation has been applied to prepare a transformed data-set and the power factor, lambda, (with best value of 0.005), for this transformation, has been determined using probability plots and histogram characteristics. Input combination selection procedure is carried out in WinGamma environment with the help of Genetic Algorithm (GA). Two-layer ANN models have been trained through Broyden, Fletcher and Goldfrab Shano (BFGS) training algorithm for both original and transformed data-sets. The comparison of models clearly indicate that the models developed through transformed data-set showed better performance in both training and testing phases with high values of NSE and R-2 which is above 90% in most of the cases, and less other statistical errors including RMSE, VARIANCE and BIAS. Simple preprocessing options, could significantly reduce the uncertainty in ANN based hydrological models through improving the quality of real time hydrological data.",https://doi.org/10.1007/s12205-021-1859-y,10.1007/s12205-021-1859-y,J,"Hassan, M; Hassan, I",NA,NA,NA,"Hassan, Muhammad; Hassan, Ishtiaq",NA,NA,y,KSCE JOURNAL OF CIVIL ENGINEERING,NA,NA,English,Article,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,Hydrological data; Data preprocessing; Box-Cox transformation; ANN models; Gamma statistics,WAVELET; SERIES; ANN; INTELLIGENCE; PREDICTION,"[Hassan, Muhammad; Hassan, Ishtiaq] Capital Univ Sci & Technol CUST, Civil Engn Dept, Islamabad 44000, Pakistan",NA,"Hassan, M (corresponding author), Capital Univ Sci & Technol CUST, Civil Engn Dept, Islamabad 44000, Pakistan.",hassan.ce@must.edu.pk,NA,"Hassan, Ishtiaq/0000-0003-3570-510X; Hassan, Muhammad/0000-0001-7627-4612",NA,NA,NA,59,0,0,2,3,KOREAN SOCIETY OF CIVIL ENGINEERS-KSCE,SEOUL,"3-16 JUNGDAE-RO 25-GIL, SONGPA-GU, SEOUL, 05661, SOUTH KOREA",1226-7988,1976-3808,NA,KSCE J CIV ENG,KSCE J.

826,Hindcasting and Forecasting Total Suspended Sediment Concentrations Using a NARX Neural Network,"Estimating and forecasting suspended sediments concentrations in streams constitutes a valuable asset for sustainable land management. This research presents the development of a non-linear autoregressive exogenous neural network (NARX) for forecasting sediment concentrations at the exit of Francia Creek watershed (Valparaiso, Chile). Details are presented on input data selection, data splitting, selection of model architecture, determination of model structure, NARX training (optimization of model parameters), and model validation (hindcasting and forecasting). The study explored if the developed artificial neural network model is valid for forecasting daily suspended sediment concentrations for a complete year, capturing seasonal trends, and maximum and baseflow concentrations. Francia Creek watershed covers approximately 3.24 km(2). Land cover within the catchment consists mainly of native and exotic vegetation, eroded soil, and urban areas. Input data consisting of precipitation and stream flow time-series were fed to a NARX network for forecasting daily suspended sediments (SST) concentrations for years 2013-2014, and hindcasting for years 2008-2010. Training of the network was performed with daily SST, precipitation, and flow data from years 2012 and 2013. The resulting NARX net consisted of an open-loop, 12-node hidden layer, 100 iterations, using Bayesian regularization backpropagation. Hindcasting of daily and monthly SST concentrations for years 2008 through 2010 was successful. Daily SST concentrations for years 2013 and 2014 were forecasted successfully for baseflow conditions (R-2 = 0.73, NS = 0.71, and Kling-Gupta efficiency index (K-G) = 0.84). Forecasting daily SST concentrations for year 2014 was within acceptable statistical fit and error margins (R-2 = 0.53, NS = 0.47, K-G = 0.60, d = 0.82). Forecasting of monthly maximum SST concentrations for the two-year period (2013 and 2014) was also successful (R-2 = 0.69, NS = 0.60, K-G = 0.54, d = 0.84).",https://doi.org/10.3390/su13010363,10.3390/su13010363,J,"Alarcon, VJ",NA,NA,NA,"Alarcon, Vladimir J.",NA,NA,y,SUSTAINABILITY,NA,NA,English,Article,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NARX; total suspended sediment; forecasting; Valparaiso; Chile; watershed,MODEL; TURBIDITY; NITRATE,"[Alarcon, Vladimir J.] Univ Diego Portales, Dept Civil Engn, Santiago 8370191, Chile",NA,"Alarcon, VJ (corresponding author), Univ Diego Portales, Dept Civil Engn, Santiago 8370191, Chile.",Vladimir.alarcon@udp.cl,"Alarcon, Vladimir J/P-9202-2016","Alarcon, Vladimir J/0000-0001-6629-5639",NA,NA,NA,38,1,1,1,1,MDPI,BASEL,"ST ALBAN-ANLAGE 66, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND",NA,2071-1050,NA,SUSTAINABILITY-BASEL,Sustainability,JAN,2021,13,1,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,363,10.3390/su13010363,NA,NA,18,Green & Sustainable Science & Technology; Environmental Sciences; Environmental Studies,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Science & Technology - Other Topics; Environmental Sciences & Ecology,PQ3OE,WOS:000606455800001,NA,gold,NA,NA,2/17/2022
