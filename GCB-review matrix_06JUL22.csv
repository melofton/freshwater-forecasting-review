"how is uncertainty incorporated? present = The model contains this concept (e.g. the model has parameters), but the values used are not derived from data and no uncertainty is represented (e.g. spin-up initial conditions, drivers are scenarios, hand-tuned single-value parameters); data_driven = The model contains this concept and the inputs are data driven but uncertainty in this input is not explicitly propagated into predictions (e.g. calibrated model parameters, a single time series of observed meteorological driver data). For sake of internal consistency, quantitative forecasts of other variables that are used as inputs into ecological forecasts (e.g. weather forecasts) should be treated as data.; propagates = The model propagates uncertainty about this term into forecasts. The most common example of this is a model run multiple times (i.e. ensemble) that samples the distributions of parameters, initial conditions, or drivers. Alternatively, one might be using an analytical approach to estimate how input uncertainties for a specific term translates into output uncertainties.; assimilates = The model iteratively updates this term through data assimilation. An example would be using a formal variational (e.g. 4DVar) or ensemble (EnKF, PF) data assimilation approach. For simpler models, this would also include iteratively refitting the whole model in light of new data.
