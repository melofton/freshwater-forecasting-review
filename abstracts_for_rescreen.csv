FALSE,1,"Forecasting the combined effects of anticipated climate change and agricultural conservation practices on fish recruitment dynamics in Lake Erie","Many aquatic ecosystems are experiencing multiple anthropogenic stressors that threaten their ability to support ecologically and economically important fish species. Two of the most ubiquitous stressors are climate change and non-point source nutrient pollution. Agricultural conservation practices (ACPs, i.e. farming practices that reduce runoff, prevent erosion, and curb excessive nutrient loading) offer a potential means to mitigate the negative effects of non-point source pollution on fish populations. However, our understanding of how ACP implementation amidst a changing climate will affect fish production in large ecosystems that receive substantial upstream sediment and nutrient inputs remains incomplete. Towards this end, we explored how anticipated climate change and the implementation of realistic ACPs might alter the recruitment dynamics of three fish populations (native walleye Sander vitreus and yellow perch Perca flavescens and invasive white perch Morone americana) in the highly productive, dynamic west basin of Lake Erie. We projected future (2020-2065) recruitment under different combinations of anticipated climate change (n = 2 levels) and ACP implementation (n = 4 levels) in the western Lake Erie catchment using predictive biological models driven by forecasted winter severity, spring warming rate, and Maumee River total phosphorus loads that were generated from linked climate, catchment-hydrology, and agricultural-practice-simulation models. In general, our models projected reduced walleye and yellow perch recruitment whereas invasive white perch recruitment was projected to remain stable or increase relative to the recent past. Our modelling also suggests the potential for trade-offs, as ACP implementation was projected to reduce yellow perch recruitment with anticipated climate change. Overall, our study presents a useful modelling framework to forecast fish recruitment in Lake Erie and elsewhere, as well as offering projections and new avenues of research that could help resource management agencies and policy-makers develop adaptive and resilient management strategies in the face of anticipated climate and land-management change.","https://doi.org/10.1111/fwb.13515","10.1111/fwb.13515","Dippold, David A.; Aloysius, Noel R.; Keitzer, Steven Conor; Yen, Haw; Arnold, Jeffrey G.; Daggupati, Prasad; Fraker, Michael E.; Martin, Jay F.; Robertson, Dale M.; Sowa, Scott P.; Johnson, Mari-Vaughn V.; White, Mike J.; Ludsin, Stuart A.","FRESHWATER BIOLOGY","climate warming; eutrophication; fisheries management; multiple stressors; percid","STIZOSTEDION-VITREUM-VITREUM; LAURENTIAN GREAT-LAKES; PERCH PERCA-FLAVESCENS; FRESH-WATER FISHES; EASTERN BERING-SEA; YELLOW PERCH; WHITE PERCH; RE-EUTROPHICATION; MORONE-AMERICANA; ENVIRONMENTAL-FACTORS",NA,"WILEY","HOBOKEN","111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA","0046-5070","1365-2427",NA,"FRESHWATER BIOL","Freshw.

TRUE,2,"Projecting the effects of agricultural conservation practices on stream fish communities in a changing climate","How anticipated climate change might affect long-term outcomes of present-day agricultural conservation practices remains a key uncertainty that could benefit water quality and biodiversity conservation planning. To explore this issue, we forecasted how the stream fish communities in the Western Lake Erie Basin (WLEB) would respond to increasing amounts of agricultural conservation practice (ACP) implementation under two IPCC future greenhouse gas emission scenarios (RCP4.5: moderate reductions; RCP8.5: business-as-usual conditions) during 2020-2065. We used output from 19 General Circulation Models to drive linked agricultural land use (APEX), watershed hydrology (SWAT), and stream fish distribution (boosted regression tree) models, subsequently analyzing how projected changes in habitat would influence fish community composition and functional trait diversity. Our models predicted both positive and negative effects of climate change and ACP implementation on WLEB stream fishes. For most species, climate and ACPs influenced species in the same direction, with climate effects outweighing those of ACP implementation. Functional trait analysis helped clarify the varied responses among species, indicating that more extreme climate change would reduce available habitat for large-bodied, cool-water species with equilibrium life-histories, many of which also are of importance to recreational fishing (e.g., northern pike, smallmouth bass). By contrast, available habitat forwarm-water, benthic species with more periodic or opportunistic life-histories (e.g., northern hogsucker, greater redhorse, greenside darter) was predicted to increase. Further, ACP implementation was projected to hasten these shifts, suggesting that efforts to improve water quality could come with costs to other ecosystem services (e.g., recreational fishing opportunities). Collectively, our findings demonstrate the need to consider biological outcomes when developing strategies to mitigate water quality impairment and highlight the value of physical-biological modeling approaches to agricultural and biological conservation planning in a changing climate.

FALSE,3,"HMETS-A Simple and Efficient Hydrology Model for Teaching Hydrological Modelling, Flow Forecasting and Climate Change Impacts","Hydrological models are commonly used to forecast streamflow and for climate change impact studies. There is a wide range of hydrology models using lumped conceptual approaches all the way to more physically based distributed algorithms. Most of these models come with a steep learning curve before they can be used efficiently by the end user, and they can be tricky to calibrate appropriately. Only a small number of hydrology models can be considered easy to set up and use, and even fewer provide their source code for easy modification to be tailored to individual needs. These drawbacks make it difficult to use these models in educational applications. The goal of this paper is to introduce a very simple, yet efficient, lumped-conceptual hydrological model designed to address the above problems. The MATLAB-based HMETS hydrological model is simple and can be easily and quickly set up on a new watershed, including automatic calibration using state of the art optimization algorithms. Despite its simplicity, the model has proved to perform well against two other lumped-conceptual hydrological models over 320 watersheds. HMETS obtained a median Nash-Sutcliffe Efficiency of 0.72 in validation, compared to 0.64 for MOHYSE (similar structure) and 0.77 for HSAMI (more complex structure). The model's source code is freely available and includes an optional simplified user interface. A climate change impacts simulation tool using the constant scaling downscaling method is also incorporated to the interface. HMETS has been tested in the Construction Engineering Final-Year Project for a group of 60 undergraduate students.","https://doi.org/",NA,"Martel, Jean-Luc; Demeester, Kenjy; Brissette, Francois; Poulin, Annie; Arsenault, Richard","INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ENGINEERING EDUCATION","teaching hydrological modelling; rainfall-runoff model; lumped model; conceptual model; climate change impact studies","UNCERTAINTY; OPTIMIZATION; EQUIFINALITY",NA,"TEMPUS PUBLICATIONS","DURRUS, BANTRY","IJEE , ROSSMORE,, DURRUS, BANTRY, COUNTY CORK 00000, IRELAND","0949-149X",NA,NA,"INT J ENG EDUC","Int.

TRUE,4,"Comparing models using air and water temperature to forecast an aquatic invasive species response to climate change","Understanding invasive species spread and projecting how distributions will respond to climate change is a central task for ecologists. Typically, current and projected air temperatures are used to forecast future distributions of invasive species based on climate matching in an ecological niche modeling approach. While this approach was originally developed for terrestrial species, it has also been widely applied to aquatic species even though aquatic species do not experience air temperatures directly. In the case of lakes, species respond to lake thermal regimes, which reflect the interaction of climate and lake attributes such as depth, size, and clarity. The result is that adjacent waterbodies can differ notably in thermal regime. Given these obvious limitations of modeling aquatic species distributions using climate data, we take advantage of recent advances in simulating lake thermal regimes to model the distributions of invasive spiny water flea (Bythotrephes cederstromii) for current and projected future climates in the upper Midwest of the USA. We compared predictions and future projections from models based on modeled air temperatures with models based on modeled water temperature. All models predicted that the number of suitable lakes in the region will decrease with climate change. Models based on air and water temperature differed dramatically in the extent of this decrease. The air temperature model predicted 89% of study lakes to be suitable, with suitability declining dramatically in the late century with climate warming to just a single suitable lake. Lake suitability predictions from the water temperature model declined to a much lesser degree with warming (42% of lakes were predicted to be suitable, declining to 19% in the late century) and were more spatially independent. Our results expose the limitations of using air temperatures to model habitat suitability for aquatic species, and our study further highlights the importance of understanding lake-specific responses to climate when assessing aquatic species responses to climate change. While we project a contraction in the potential range ofBythotrepheswith warming in the study region, we anticipate thatBythotrepheswill likely continue to expand into new lakes that will remain suitable in the following decades.","https://doi.org/10.1002/ecs2.3137","10.1002/ecs2.3137","Walsh, Jake R.; Hansen, Gretchen J.

FALSE,5,"A Forecasting and Prediction Methodology for Improving the Blue Economy Resilience to Climate Change in the Romanian Lower Danube Euroregion","European Union (EU) policy encourages the development of a blue economy (BE) by unlocking the full economic potential of oceans, seas, lakes, rivers and other water resources, especially in member countries in which it represents a low contribution to the national economy (under 1%). However, climate change represents a main barrier to fully realizing a BE. Enabling conditions that will support the sustainable development of a BE and increase its climate resiliency must be promoted. Romania has high potential to contribute to the development of the EU BE due to its geographic characteristics, namely the presence of the Danube Delta-Black Sea macrosystem, which is part of the Romanian Lower Danube Euroregion (RLDE). Aquatic living resources represent a sector which can significantly contribute to the growth of the BE in the RLDE, a situation which imposes restrictions for both halting biodiversity loss and maintaining the proper conditions to maximize the benefits of the existing macrosystem. It is known that climate change causes water quality problems, accentuates water level fluctuations and loss of biodiversity and induces the destruction of habitats, which eventually leads to fish stock depletion. This paper aims to develop an analytical framework based on multiple linear predictive and forecast models that offers cost-efficient tools for the monitoring and control of water quality, fish stock dynamics and biodiversity in order to strengthen the resilience and adaptive capacity of the BE of the RLDE in the context of climate change. The following water-dependent variables were considered: total nitrogen (TN); total phosphorus (TP); dissolved oxygen (DO); pH; water temperature (wt); and water level, all of which were measured based on a series of 26 physicochemical indicators associated with 4 sampling areas within the RLDE (Braila, Galati, Tulcea and Sulina counties). Predictive models based on fish species catches associated with the Galati County Danube River Basin segment and the Danube Delta Biosphere Reserve Administration territory were included in the analytical framework to establish an efficient tool for monitoring fish stock dynamics and structures as well as identify methods of controlling fish biodiversity in the RLDE to enhance the sustainable development and resilience of the already-existing BE and its expansion (blue growth) in the context of aquatic environment climate variation. The study area reflects the integrated approach of the emerging BE, focused on the ocean, seas, lakes and rivers according to the United Nations Agenda. The results emphasized the vulnerability of the RLDE to climate change, a situation revealed by the water level, air temperature and water quality parameter trend lines and forecast models. Considering the sampling design applied within the RLDE, it can be stated that the Tulcea county Danube sector was less affected by climate change compared with the Galati county sector as confirmed by water TN and TP forecast analysis, which revealed higher increasing trends in Galati compared with Tulcea. The fish stock biodiversity was proven to be affected by global warming within the RLDE, since peaceful species had a higher upward trend compared with predatory species. Water level and air temperature forecasting analysis proved to be an important tool for climate change monitoring in the study area. The resulting analytical framework confirmed that time series methods could be used together with machine learning prediction methods to highlight their synergetic abilities for monitoring and predicting the impact of climate change on the marine living resources of the BE sector within the RLDE. The forecasting models developed in the present study were meant to be used as methods of revealing future information, making it possible for decision makers to adopt proper management solutions to prevent or limit the negative impacts of climate change on the BE. Through the identified independent variables, prediction models offer a solution for managing the dependent variables and the possibility of performing less cost-demanding aquatic environment monitoring activities.","https://doi.org/10.3390/su132111563","10.3390/su132111563","Petrea, Stefan Mihai; Zamfir, Cristina; Simionov, Ira Adeline; Mogodan, Alina; Nuta, Florian Marcel; Rahoveanu, Adrian Turek; Nancu, Dumitru; Cristea, Dragos Sebastian; Buhociu, Florin Marian","SUSTAINABILITY","blue economy; fish stocks; water quality; machine learning; forecast models","ARTIFICIAL NEURAL-NETWORKS; WATER-QUALITY INDEX; DISSOLVED-OXYGEN; CHANGE IMPACTS; FISH; RIVER; GROWTH; FISHERIES; LEVEL; NORTH",NA,"MDPI","BASEL","ST ALBAN-ANLAGE 66, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND",NA,"2071-1050",NA,"SUSTAINABILITY-BASEL","Sustainability","NOV",2021,"13","21",NA,NA,"11563",NA
FALSE,6,"A meta-modeling approach for hydrological forecasting under uncertainty: Application to groundwater nitrate response to climate change","We suggest a quantitative predictive approach based on meta-modeling techniques for long-term forecasting in hydrology. We apply our scalable methodological framework to a representative groundwater body in EmiliaRomagna region of Italy to evaluate the potential impact of climate change on groundwater nitrate concentration. The approach allows to (i) handle the uncertainty associated with the projection of climate variables, (ii) preserve an accurate description of flow and transport processes, and (iii) drastically accelerate computationally intensive simulations, at a time. A long-term climate scenario (i.e. referred to the 30-years 2061-2090) is developed for the study area by considering changes in the natural recharge to groundwater, the baseflow of the main rivers, and the rate of nitrate leaching. Global sensitivity analysis is performed to assess the relative influence of these factors on the quantity of interest (QoI), i.e. the long-term prediction of groundwater nitrate concentration. Our analysis enables also us to compute the spatial statistics and variability of the moments of the QoI over the study area and to perform Monte Carlo simulations to fully characterize the probabilistic behavior of the QoI at selected sensitive locations.","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jhydrol.2021.127173","10.1016/j.jhydrol.2021.127173","Focaccia, S.; Panini, G.; Pedrazzoli, P.; Ciriello, V","JOURNAL OF HYDROLOGY","Meta-modeling; Polynomial chaos expansion; Nitrate contamination; Climate change; Groundwater","GLOBAL SENSITIVITY-ANALYSIS; POLYNOMIAL CHAOS; FRAMEWORK; IMPACTS",NA,"ELSEVIER","AMSTERDAM","RADARWEG 29, 1043 NX AMSTERDAM, NETHERLANDS","0022-1694","1879-2707",NA,"J HYDROL","J.

FALSE,7,"A multi-scenario ensemble streamflow forecast method for Amu Darya River Basin under considering climate and land-use changes","Land-use and climate changes have impacts on hydrological processes for river basin. In this study, a multi-scenario ensemble streamflow forecast (MESF) method is developed for analyzing the streamflow variation under considering climate and land-use changes, through incorporating CA-Markov model, global climate model (GCM) and Soil and Water Assessment Tool (SWAT) model within a general framework. The advantages of MESF are as follows: (i) it can simultaneously assess the impacts of land-use and climate changes on streamflow; (ii) it can obtain the possible trend and the range of future streamflows through ensemble forecast under multiple scenarios; (iii) based on analysis of streamflow processes under extreme scenarios, it can examine the effects of key factors on streamflow. The MESF method is applied to the upper reaches of the Amu Darya River Basin in Central Asia. Totally 72 scenarios, under different land-use patterns, GCMs and Representative Concentration Pathways (RCPs), are analyzed. Ensemble forecast results reveal that (i) during 2021-2050, the average annual precipitation and the average annual temperature would both increase, but the mean annual streamflow would decrease; (ii) compared to the impact of land-use change, climate change has more obvious effects on the streamflow (with contribution of 78.8%-98.7%); (iii) among all factors of land-use change, glacier melting triggered by climate warming is the most prominent factor; (iv) the peak flow in one year would have a tendency to shift from summer to spring due to the rising temperature and the speeding up snow melt.","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jhydrol.2021.126276","10.1016/j.jhydrol.2021.126276","Xu, Z.

FALSE,8,"Forecasting water temperature in lakes and reservoirs using seasonal climate prediction","Seasonal climate forecasts produce probabilistic predictions of meteorological variables for subsequent months. This provides a potential resource to predict the influence of seasonal climate anomalies on surface water balance in catchments and hydro-thermodynamics in related water bodies (e.g., lakes or reservoirs). Obtaining seasonal forecasts for impact variables (e.g., discharge and water temperature) requires a link between seasonal climate forecasts and impact models simulating hydrology and lake hydrodynamics and thermal regimes. However, this link remains challenging for stakeholders and the water scientific community, mainly due to the probabilistic nature of these predictions. In this paper, we introduce a feasible, robust, and open-source workflow integrating seasonal climate forecasts with hydrologic and lake models to generate seasonal forecasts of discharge and water temperature profiles. The workflow has been designed to be applicable to any catchment and associated lake or reservoir, and is optimized in this study for four catchment-lake systems to help in their proactive management. We assessed the performance of the resulting seasonal forecasts of discharge and water temperature by comparing them with hydrologic and lake (pseudo)observations (reanalysis). Precisely, we analysed the historical performance using a data sample of past forecasts and reanalysis to obtain information about the skill (performance or quality) of the seasonal forecast system to predict particular events. We used the current seasonal climate forecast system (SEAS5) and reanalysis (ERA5) of the European Centre for Medium Range Weather Forecasts (ECMWF). We found that due to the limited predictability at seasonal time-scales over the locations of the four case studies (Europe and South of Australia), seasonal forecasts exhibited none to low performance (skill) for the atmospheric variables considered. Nevertheless, seasonal forecasts for discharge present some skill in all but one case study. Moreover, seasonal forecasts for water temperature had higher performance in natural lakes than in reservoirs, which means human water control is a relevant factor affecting predictability, and the performance increases with water depth in all four case studies. Further investigation into the skillful water temperature predictions should aim to identify the extent to which performance is a consequence of thermal inertia (i.e., lead-in conditions).

FALSE,10,"Enhancing Ensemble Seasonal Streamflow Forecasts in the Upper Colorado River Basin Using Multi-Model Climate Forecasts","In the Colorado River Basin (CRB), ensemble streamflow prediction (ESP) forecasts drive operational planning models that project future reservoir system conditions. CRB operational seasonal streamflow forecasts are produced using ESP, which represents climate using an ensemble of meteorological sequences of historical temperature and precipitation, but do not typically leverage additional real-time subseasonal-to-seasonal climate forecasts. Any improvements to streamflow forecasts would help stakeholders who depend on operational projections for decision making. We explore incorporating climate forecasts into ESP through variations on an ESP trace weighting approach, focusing on Colorado River unregulated inflows forecasts to Lake Powell. The k-nearest neighbors (kNN) technique is employed using North American Multi-Model Ensemble one- and three-month temperature and precipitation forecasts, and preceding three-month historical streamflow, as weighting factors. The benefit of disaggregated climate forecast information is assessed through the comparison of two kNN weighting strategies; a basin-wide kNN uses the same ESP weights over the entire basin, and a disaggregated-basin kNN applies ESP weights separately to four subbasins. We find in general that climate-informed forecasts add greater marginal skill in late winter and early spring, and that more spatially granular disaggregated-basin use of climate forecasts slightly improves skill over the basin-wide method at most lead times.","https://doi.org/10.1111/1752-1688.12960","10.1111/1752-1688.12960","Baker, Sarah A.; Rajagopalan, Balaji; Wood, Andrew W.","JOURNAL OF THE AMERICAN WATER RESOURCES ASSOCIATION","streamflow forecasts; trace weighting; subseasonal-to-seasonal; climate forecasts; Colorado River; NMME; reservoir inflows","PREDICTION; SKILL; COLUMBIA; MODEL; SCORE; ENSO",NA,"WILEY","HOBOKEN","111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA","1093-474X","1752-1688",NA,"J AM WATER RESOUR AS","J.

FALSE,11,"Forecasting low flow conditions months in advance through teleconnection patterns, with a special focus on summer 2018","Over the past decades, Europe has been affected by several low flow periods which had substantial impacts on the hydrology of the rivers themselves as well as on the society and economy. Low flow periods have a direct impact on the environment, on the inland waterway navigation, on the hydropower production as well as on the sediment management, among others. Similar to floods, low flows are naturally occurring phenomena which can significantly hinder different uses and functions of the rivers and impact the aquatic system and the water quality. Moreover, it is projected that, in the future, climate change might lead to drier summers over the European region and therefore to more frequent and severe low flow periods. The results presented here show that the summer 2018 low flow situation, over the Rhine and Elbe Rivers basin, could have been predicted up to two seasons ahead by using previous months' sea surface temperature, sea level pressure, precipitation, mean air temperature and soil moisture. The lagged relationship between the predictand (e.g. seasonal streamflow) and the climate and oceanic predictors varies between 1 month (e.g. precipitation) up to 6 months (e.g. sea surface temperature). Taking into account that all predictors are available in real-time, the forecast scheme can be used to provide early warnings for the upcoming low flow situations, thus offering the possibility for better management of the water resources.","https://doi.org/10.1038/s41598-020-70060-8","10.1038/s41598-020-70060-8","Ionita, M.; Nagavciuc, V","SCIENTIFIC REPORTS",NA,"NORTH-ATLANTIC OSCILLATION; VARIABILITY; STREAMFLOW; DROUGHT; TEMPERATURE; CLIMATE",NA,"NATURE RESEARCH","BERLIN","HEIDELBERGER PLATZ 3, BERLIN, 14197, GERMANY","2045-2322",NA,NA,"SCI REP-UK","Sci Rep","AUG 6",2020,"10","1",NA,NA,"13258",NA
FALSE,12,"Variation in the predictability of lake plankton metric types","Statistical and climate models are frequently used for biodiversity projections under future climatic changes, but their predictive capacity for freshwater plankton may vary among different species and community metrics. Here, we used random forests to model plankton species and community metrics as a function of biological, climatic, physical, and chemical data from long-term (2000-2017) monitoring data collected from Lake Muggelsee Berlin, Germany. We (1) compared the predictability of well-known lake plankton metric types (biomass, abundance, taxonomic diversity, Shannon diversity, Simpson diversity, evenness, taxonomic distinctness, and taxonomic richness) and (2) assessed how the relative influence of different environmental drivers varies across lake plankton metric models. Overall, the metric predictability was highest for biomass and abundance followed by taxonomic richness. The biomass of dominant phytoplankton taxonomic groups such as cyanobacteria (adjusted-R-2 = 0.53) and the abundance of dominant zooplankton taxonomic groups such as rotifers (adjusted-R-2 = 0.59) and daphnids (adjusted-R-2 = 0.51) were more predictable than other metric types. The plankton metric predictability increased when grouping phytoplankton species according to their functional traits (adjusted-R-2 = 0.37 +/- 0.14, mean +/- SD, n = 36 functional groups) compared to higher taxonomic units (adjusted-R-2 = 0.25 +/- 0.15, n = 22 taxonomic groups). Light, nutrients, water temperature, and seasonality for phytoplankton and food resources for zooplankton were the main drivers of both taxonomic and functional groups, giving confidence that our models captured the expected major environmental drivers. Our quantitative analyses highlight the multidimensionality of lake planktonic responses to environmental drivers and have implications for our capacity to select appropriate metrics for forecasting the future of lake ecosystems under global change scenarios.","https://doi.org/10.1002/lno.12021","10.1002/lno.12021","Kakouei, Karan; Kraemer, Benjamin M.; Adrian, Rita","LIMNOLOGY AND OCEANOGRAPHY",NA,"TAXONOMIC DISTINCTNESS; ENVIRONMENTAL GRADIENTS; CYANOBACTERIA DOMINANCE; ANTHROPOGENIC IMPACTS; DIVERSITY INDEXES; TRAIT COMPOSITION; POLYMICTIC LAKE; PHYTOPLANKTON; BIODIVERSITY; CONSEQUENCES",NA,"WILEY","HOBOKEN","111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA","0024-3590","1939-5590",NA,"LIMNOL OCEANOGR","Limnol.

FALSE,13,"Ensemble Based Forecasting and Optimization Framework to Optimize Releases from Water Supply Reservoirs for Flood Control","Water supply reservoir management is based on long-term management policies which depend on customer demands and seasonal hydrologic changes. However, increasing frequency and intensity of precipitation events is necessitating the short-term management of such reservoirs to reduce downstream flooding. Operational management of reservoirs at hourly/daily timescales is challenging due to the uncertainty associated with the inflow forecasts and the volumes in the reservoir. We present an ensemble-based streamflow prediction and optimization framework consisting of a regional scale hydrologic model forced with ensemble precipitation inputs to obtain probabilistic inflows to the reservoir. A multi-objective dynamic programming model was used to obtain optimized release strategies accounting for the inflow uncertainties. The proposed framework was evaluated at a water supply reservoir in the Hackensack River basin in New Jersey during Hurricanes Irene and Sandy. Hurricane Irene resulted in the overtopping of the dam despite releases made in anticipation of the event and resulted in severe downstream flooding. Hurricane Sandy was characterized by low rainfall, however, raised significant concerns of flooding given the nature of the event. The improvement in NSE for the Hurricane Irene inflows from 0.5 to 0.76 and reduction of the spread of PBIAS with decreasing lead times resulted in improvements in the forecast informed releases. This study provides perspectives on the benefits of the proposed forecasting and optimization framework in reducing the decision making burden on the operator by providing the uncertainties associated with the inflows, releases and the water levels in the reservoir.","https://doi.org/10.1007/s11269-019-02481-8","10.1007/s11269-019-02481-8","Ramaswamy, V.; Saleh, F.","WATER RESOURCES MANAGEMENT","ECMWF; flood control; Irene; ensemble; Dynamic programming","ARTIFICIAL NEURAL-NETWORKS; OPTIMAL OPERATION; HURRICANE IRENE; CLIMATE-CHANGE; PREDICTION; INFLOW; SYSTEM; MODELS; ECMWF; MANAGEMENT",NA,"SPRINGER","DORDRECHT","VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS","0920-4741","1573-1650",NA,"WATER RESOUR MANAG","Water Resour.

TRUE,14,"Forecasting of Future Flooding and Risk Assessment under CMIP6 Climate Projection in Neuse River, North Carolina","Hydrological extremes associated with climate change are becoming an increasing concern all over the world. Frequent flooding, one of the extremes, needs to be analyzed while considering climate change to mitigate flood risk. This study forecast streamflow and evaluate risk of flooding in the Neuse River, North Carolina considering future climatic scenarios, and comparing them with an existing Federal Emergency Management Agency study. The cumulative distribution function transformation method was adopted for bias correction to reduce the uncertainty present in the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project Phase 6 (CMIP6) streamflow data. To calculate 100-year and 500-year flood discharges, the Generalized Extreme Value (L-Moment) was utilized on bias-corrected multimodel ensemble data with different climate projections.

TRUE,15,"Operationalizing a flood forecasting decision support system for Ayeyarwady river, Myanmar","Myanmar is one of the developing countries of South East Asia (SEA), wherein millions of people are exposed to risk of flooding every year. The Department of Meteorology and Hydrology (DMH), Myanmar is thus, bestowed with the responsibility of flood forecasting within the country for early warning. This study presents a new web-based Decision Support System (DSS), for DMH's use in operational flood forecasting. The new DSS, that has a forecast lead time of 24-72 h, is a significant improvement over the existing forecasting systems used by DMH, which had a lead time of 4-24 h. Moreover, the new DSS couples Hydrological Engineering Centre Hydrological Modelling System (HEC-HMS) with Weather and Research (WRF) rainfall forecast for Ayeyarwady river basin (ARB), the principle river basin of the country. In addition to the hydro-meteorological coupling, core modules of the DSS include rainfall forecasting, bias correction and flow error correction. The hydrological model setup of the DSS was calibrated and validated for the periods 2008-2012 and 2013-2014 with observed rainfall. The DSS was then actively deployed and tested operationally by DMH using bias-corrected WRF rainfall forecasts for the period 2015-2017. Performance of the system is very good in forecasting flows and floods within ARB, and also provides additional lead time to DMH for issuing the flood advisories. Hence, the novel web-based flood forecasting DSS, is an important applied research contribution, that is being successfully used by the operational staff of DMH for short-term flood forecasting in Myanmar and has the potential to improve flood resiliency of similar agencies in the SEA region.","https://doi.org/10.1080/15715124.2020.1738445","10.1080/15715124.2020.1738445","Agarwal, Anshul; Ghimire, Uttam; Than, Htay Htay; Srinivasan, Govindarajalu; Dash, Itesh; Shakya, Niraj; Oo, Myo Tun","INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF RIVER BASIN MANAGEMENT","Flood forecasting system; Decision Support system; Weather Research and forecasting; HEC-HMS; Ayeyarwady river basin; Myanmar","HEC-HMS; BIAS CORRECTION; COUPLING WRF; RAINFALL; BASIN; PREDICTION; WEATHER; MODEL; SCALE; TIME",NA,"TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD","ABINGDON","2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OR14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND","1571-5124","1814-2060",NA,"INT J RIVER BASIN MA","Int.

Design/methodology/approach - The hybrid models GA-SVM and GA-RVM were developed for the optimal control of parameters for predicting (based on the current month's variables) and forecasting (based on the previous three months' variables) phytoplankton dynamics in a Macau freshwater reservoir, MSR, which has experienced cyanobacterial blooms in recent years. There were 15 environmental parameters, including pH, SiO2, alkalinity, bicarbonate (HCO3-), dissolved oxygen (DO), total nitrogen (TN), UV254, turbidity, conductivity, nitrate (NO3-), orthophosphate (PO43-), total phosphorus (TP), suspended solids (SS) and total organic carbon (TOC) selected from the correlation analysis, with eight years (2001-2008) of data for training, and the most recent three years (2009-2011) for testing. Findings - For both accuracy performance and generalized performance, the ANN, GA-SVM and GA-RVM had similar predictive powers of R-2 of 0.73-0.75. However, whereas ANN and GA-RVM models showed very similar forecast performances, GA-SVM models had better forecast performances of R-2 (0.862), RMSE (0.266) and MAE (0.0710) with the respective parameters of 0.987, 0.161 and 0.032 optimized using GA. Originality/value - This is the first application of GA-SVM and GA-RVM models for predicting and forecasting algal bloom in freshwater reservoirs.

Actual observational data of Armhydromet for maximum flow rate, air temperature and precipitation were used as the source material. The available literature sources were processed and analyzed, the mathematical-statistical, geographical, and also methods of comparison and analysis were applied. To determine the maximum flow rates of the Marmarik River, the Ankavan post and the Gomur River, the Meghradzor post, the winter period precipitation, the sum of positive temperatures, liquid precipitation, the volume of the runoff of the flood period were used, but no reliable dependencies were obtained. Dependencies obtained can be used for consultations. To determine the maximum flow at the Aghavnadzor post of the Marmarik River, a multifactorial correlation close relationship was obtained, which can be used to compile operational forecasts of the maximum flow in this river site. The absolute values of the maximum river flow of the Marmarik River at Aghavnadzor are estimated for different scenarios of climate change. For different scenarios and cases in the Marmarik River basin, a different degree of changes in the maximum flow might be expected. Moreover, the largest decrease in the maximum runoff of the Marmarik River basin is expected under the conditions of an increase in the average air temperature of the spring season by 2.7-3.9 and a decrease in the amount of spring atmospheric precipitation by 2.4-2.6%. As a result of the study, it turned out that in the study area there is only a tendency to decrease the values of maximum water discharge which is the result of both human activities and climate change.","https://doi.org/10.17223/25421379/13/4","10.17223/25421379/13/4","Margaryan, V.

FALSE,19,"Prediction of Yangtze River streamflow based on deep learning neural network with El Nino-Southern Oscillation","Accurate long-term streamflow and flood forecasting have always been an important research direction in hydrology research. Nowadays, climate change, floods, and other anomalies occurring more and more frequently and bringing great losses to society. The prediction of streamflow, especially flood prediction, is important for disaster prevention. Current hydrological models based on physical mechanisms can give accurate predictions of streamflow, but the effective prediction period is only about 1 month in advance, which is too short for decision making. The artificial neural network (ANN) has great potential for predicting runoff and is not only good at handling non-linear data but can also make long-period forecasts. However, most of ANN models are unstable in their predictions when faced with raw flow data, and have excessive errors in predicting extreme flows. Previous studies have shown a link between the El Nino-Southern Oscillation (ENSO) and the streamflow of the Yangtze River. In this paper, we use ENSO and the monthly streamflow data of the Yangtze River from 1952 to 2018 to predict the monthly streamflow of the Yangtze River in two extreme flood years and a small flood year by using deep neural networks. In this paper, three deep neural network frameworks are used: stacked long short-term memory, Conv long short-term memory encoder-decoder long short-term memory and Conv long short-term memory encoder-decoder gate recurrent unit. The results show that the use of ConvLSTM improves the stability of the model and increases the accuracy of the flood prediction. Besides, the introduction of ENSO to the experimental data resulted in a more accurate prediction of the time of the occurrence of flood peaks and flood flows. Furthermore, the best results were obtained on the convolutional long short-term memory+encoder-decoder gate recurrent unit model.","https://doi.org/10.1038/s41598-021-90964-3","10.1038/s41598-021-90964-3","Ha, Si; Liu, Darong; Mu, Lin","SCIENTIFIC REPORTS",NA,"MONTHLY INFLOW; ENSO; MODELS; PRECIPITATION; VARIABILITY; INDEX",NA,"NATURE RESEARCH","BERLIN","HEIDELBERGER PLATZ 3, BERLIN, 14197, GERMANY","2045-2322",NA,NA,"SCI REP-UK","Sci Rep","JUN 3",2021,"11","1",NA,NA,"11738",NA
TRUE,20,"A potential threat to amphibians in the European Natura 2000 network: Forecasting the distribution of the American bullfrog Lithobates catesbeianus","Freshwater biodiversity is declining at an accelerated pace. Climate change and associated global warming and changes in precipitation patterns, combined with the expansion of generalist -invasive species are two of the main threats. Niche-based models (NBMs) are becoming inevitable tools in invasive species risk assessment and in conservation decision-making. Lithobates catesbeianus is an invasive species globally known for its adverse ecological impacts on native amphibians and biodiversity. To assess species current and future climatic suitable areas at the global and European scales we used an ensemble forecasting approach. We considered six climatic variables, three timeframes (current, 2050, and 2070), and two CO2 emission scenarios. Temperature seasonality, minimum temperature of the coldest month, maximum temperature of the warmest month, and precipitation in the driest month were the most important variables predicting bullfrog occurrence. Globally currently 3.8% of land area is suitable for bullfrog and an increase of up to 5.2% in 2070 is expected. Increase in suitable areas is expected at higher latitudes, especially in North America and central Europe. Currently, 3.45% of total Natura 2000 area is suitable, and a predicted range gain of up to 355.93% (12.28%) is expected in the highest concentration scenarios predictions. This can indicate that the 64 native amphibian species present in the Natura 2000 network could be at increased risk. The choice of Natura 2000 for a geographic detailed analysis of the possible effects on native amphibians is due to its importance for habitats and wildlife conservation. Identification of its invasion-susceptible areas will allow resource and management practices optimization.","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.biocon.2020.108551","10.1016/j.biocon.2020.108551","Johovic, Iva; Gama, Mafalda; Banha, Filipe; Tricarico, Elena; Anastacio, Pedro Manuel","BIOLOGICAL CONSERVATION","American bullfrog; Invasive species; Habitat suitability; Natura2000","SPECIES DISTRIBUTION MODELS; CLIMATE-CHANGE; COMMUNITY STRUCTURE; RANA-CATESBEIANA; CONSERVATION; HABITAT; TEMPERATURE; POPULATIONS; EXTINCTIONS; BIODIVERSITY",NA,"ELSEVIER SCI LTD","OXFORD","THE BOULEVARD, LANGFORD LANE, KIDLINGTON, OXFORD OX5 1GB, OXON, ENGLAND","0006-3207","1873-2917",NA,"BIOL CONSERV","Biol.

TRUE,21,"Short-term forecasting of cyanobacteria blooms in Yuqiao reservoir, China","Agriculture fertilizers and untreated sewage in the catchment of freshwater bodies increase their nutrient concentrations. The resulting eutrophication promotes phytoplankton blooms, in many cases of toxic cyanobacteria. Ecological models can simulate the main processes driving algal blooms. They help to understand how phytoplankton responds to different forcing. Another major use of models is as predictive tool supporting the management of water resources. Yuqiao Reservoir is the main drinking water source for Tianjin, the fifth most populated city in China. During the last decade, drinking water production has been impaired by recurrent cyanobacteria blooms. The water quality management of the reservoir, conducted by the Hai River Water Conservancy Commission, requires an early warning system in order to anticipate the cyanobacteria blooms and to adapt the treatment process. Therefore, within the framework of a French-Chinese project on Integrated Water Resources Management (IWRM) of the catchment of the Hai river, a modelling approach of cyanobacteria growth, which could be later embedded in an early warning system, was proposed. In this study, we calibrated a one-dimensional vertical, physical-ecological model aimed at forecasting cyanobacteria blooms in the Yuqiao Reservoir. We first introduce the study site and its ecological status. Then we describe the model and the input data set. The calibration and validation results are presented for water temperature and chlorophyll-a concentration at the measurement dates. The short-term forecast modelling is performed for temperature and cyanobacteria over a 5-day ahead period.

The concentration of dissolved oxygen (DO) is a primary indicator of the health state of the aquatic habitats, and its modeling is crucial for river water quality management. This paper investigates the importance of the choices of different techniques for preprocessing and stochastic modeling for developing a simple and reliable linear stochastic model for forecasting DO in urban rivers. We describe several methods of evaluation, preprocessing, and modeling for the DO parameter time series in the Credit River, Ontario, Canada, to achieve the optimum data preprocessing and input selection techniques and consequently obtain the optimum performance of the stochastic models as an effective river management tool. The Manly normalization and standardization (S-td) methods were chosen for preprocessing the time series.

TRUE,23,"Inflow Forecast of Iranamadu Reservoir, Sri Lanka, under Projected Climate Scenarios Using Artificial Neural Networks","Prediction of water resources for future years takes much attention from the water resources planners and relevant authorities. However, traditional computational models like hydrologic models need many data about the catchment itself. Sometimes these important data on catchments are not available due to many reasons. Therefore, artificial neural networks (ANNs) are useful soft computing tools in predicting real-world scenarios, such as forecasting future water availability from a catchment, in the absence of intensive data, which are required for modeling practices in the context of hydrology. These ANNs are capable of building relationships to nonlinear real-world problems using available data and then to use that built relationship to forecast future needs. Even though Sri Lanka has an extensive usage of water resources for many activities, including drinking water supply, irrigation, hydropower development, navigation, and many other recreational purposes, forecasting studies for water resources are not being carried out. Therefore, there is a significant gap in forecasting water availability and water needs in the context of Sri Lanka. Thus, this paper presents an artificial neural network model to forecast the inflows of one of the most important reservoirs in northern Sri Lanka using the upstream catchment's rainfall. Future rainfall data are extracted using regional climate models for the years 2021-2050 and the inflows of the reservoir are forecasted using the validated neural network model. Several training algorithms including Levenberg-Marquardt (LM), BFGS quasi-Newton (BFG), scaled conjugate gradient (SCG) have been used to find the best fitting training algorithm to the prediction process of the inflows against the measured inflows. Results revealed that the LM training algorithm outperforms the other tests algorithm in developing the prediction model. In addition, the forecasted results using the projected climate scenarios clearly showcase the benefit of using the forecasting model in solving future water resource management to avoid or to minimize future water scarcity. Therefore, the validated model can effectively be used for proper planning of the proposed drinking water supply scheme to the nearby urban city, Jaffna in northern Sri Lanka.","https://doi.org/10.1155/2020/8821627","10.1155/2020/8821627","Karunanayake, Chamaka; Gunathilake, Miyuru B.; Rathnayake, Upaka","APPLIED COMPUTATIONAL INTELLIGENCE AND SOFT COMPUTING",NA,"RAINFALL-RUNOFF MODEL; WATER-BUDGET; WAVELET; SIMULATION; PREDICTION; IMPACT; ANN; VARIABILITY; ALGORITHM; CONFLICTS",NA,"HINDAWI LTD","LONDON","ADAM HOUSE, 3RD FLR, 1 FITZROY SQ, LONDON, W1T 5HF, ENGLAND","1687-9724","1687-9732",NA,"APPL COMPUT INTELL S","Appl.

To prepare for potential natural disasters and to come up with effective countermeasures against climate change, it is crucial to make use of systematic and scientific weather and climate forecasting information in the best possible way. However, it is difficult to find hydrologic data for North Korea, and direct observations of the nation's hydrology are practically impossible to make. Therefore, because of the difficulties in collecting hydrological data, studies on climate change and hydrology in North Korea are rarely conducted. This study collected precipitation and temperature data from 27 weather stations located in North Korea (provided by the World Meteorological Organization), and used the RCP8.5 climate change scenario of the Korean Meteorological Administration to calculate potential future evapotranspiration for each station. The study applied a lumped conceptual model (Water And Snow Balance MODeling system (WASMOD)) to North Korea's representative river basins (Daedong River, Aprok River) to obtain a supplementary hydrologic data time series through doing calculations based on the calculated time series data of the future hydrologic cycle components of North Korea.

TRUE,25,"Benchmarking Real-Time Streamflow Forecast Skill in the Himalayan Region","Improving decision-making in various areas of water policy and management (e.g., flood and drought preparedness, reservoir operation and hydropower generation) requires skillful streamflow forecasts. Despite the recent advances in hydrometeorological prediction, real-time streamflow forecasting over the Himalayas remains a critical issue and challenge, especially with complex basin physiography, shifting weather patterns and sparse and biased in-situ hydrometeorological monitoring data. In this study, we demonstrate the utility of low-complexity data-driven persistence-based approaches for skillful streamflow forecasting in the Himalayan country Nepal. The selected approaches are: (1) simple persistence, (2) streamflow climatology and (3) anomaly persistence. We generated the streamflow forecasts for 65 stream gauge stations across Nepal for short-to-medium range forecast lead times (1 to 12 days). The selected gauge stations were monitored by the Department of Hydrology and Meteorology (DHM) Nepal, and they represent a wide range of basin size, from similar to 17 to similar to 54,100 km(2). We find that the performance of persistence-based forecasting approaches depends highly upon the lead time, flow threshold, basin size and flow regime. Overall, the persistence-based forecast results demonstrate higher forecast skill in snow-fed rivers over intermittent ones, moderate flows over extreme ones and larger basins over smaller ones. The streamflow forecast skill obtained in this study can serve as a benchmark (reference) for the evaluation of many operational forecasting systems over the Himalayas.","https://doi.org/10.3390/forecast2030013","10.3390/forecast2030013","Ghimire, Ganesh R.; Sharma, Sanjib; Panthi, Jeeban; Talchabhadel, Rocky; Parajuli, Binod; Dahal, Piyush; Baniya, Rupesh","FORECASTING","Himalayan region; streamflow forecast verification; persistence; snow-fed rivers; intermittent rivers","EXCESS RAINFALL PROPERTIES; SCALING STRUCTURE; PEAK-DISCHARGES; VARIABILITY; IMPACT",NA,"MDPI","BASEL","ST ALBAN-ANLAGE 66, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND",NA,"2571-9394",NA,"FORECASTING-BASEL","Forecasting","SEP",2020,"2","3","230","247",NA,NA
FALSE,26,"Simulating Climate Change Impacts on Surface Water Resources Within a Lake-Affected Region Using Regional Climate Projections","This study aims to assess the impact of climate change on water resources in a large watershed within the Laurentian Great Lakes region, using the fully integrated surface-subsurface model HydroGeoSphere. The hydrologic model is forced with an ensemble of high-resolution climate projections from the Weather Research and Forecasting (WRF) model. The latter has been extended with an interactive lake model (FLake) to capture the effect of the Great Lakes on the regional climate. The WRF ensemble encompasses two different moist physics configurations at resolutions of 90, 30, and 10km, as well as four different initial and boundary conditions, so as to control for natural climate variability. The integrated hydrologic model is run with a representative seasonal cycle, which effectively controls natural climate variability, while remaining computationally tractable with a large integrated model. However, the range of natural variability is also investigated, as are the impacts of climate model resolution and bias correction. The two WRF configurations show opposite climate change responses in summer precipitation, but similar responses otherwise. The hydrologic simulations generally follow the climate forcing; however, due to the memory of the subsurface, the differences in summer propagate throughout the entire seasonal cycle. This results in a set of dry scenarios with reduced streamflow and water availability year-round and a set of wet scenarios with increased streamflow for all times excluding the spring peak, which does not increase. Most of the analysis focuses on streamflow, but changes in the seasonal cycle of baseflow and groundwater recharge are also analyzed. Plain Language Summary In this study we investigate the impact of climate change on water resources using state-of-the-art computer simulations. The simulations were conducted using physically based models, which simulate the circulation of the atmosphere, rainfall, and the flow of water above and below the surface. The region of interest here is the Grand River Watershed, located in the Great Lakes region (southern Ontario, Canada). We show that with high resolution and a physical representation of the Great Lakes, only a simple correctionmuch less than for global climate modelsis necessary, in order to simulate a realistic climate. We find that predicted climate change impacts on water resources depend strongly on some approximations commonly made to represent thunderstorms and precipitation in climate models. The most likely scenario, based on our analysis, is an increase in precipitation and streamflow in all seasons except spring, but some scenarios also show less precipitation in summer, which results in lower streamflow year-round. A major result is that differences in summer precipitation can affect streamflow in all seasons, but only if the interaction with groundwater is properly accounted for. At the moment uncertainty in future summer precipitation changes limits our ability to predict impacts on water resources.","https://doi.org/10.1029/2018WR024381","10.1029/2018WR024381","Erler, Andre R.; Frey, Steven K.; Khader, Omar; d'Orgeville, Marc; Park, Young-Jin; Hwang, Hyoun-Tae; Lapen, David R.; Peltier, W.

Physical models, ensemble streamflow prediction (ESP), do not have skill beyond interannual time scales. However, Global Climate Models have good skill in projecting decadal temperatures. This, combined with the sensitivity of CRB flows to temperature from recent studies, motivate the research question, can skill in decadal temperature projections be translated to operationally skillful flow projections and consequently, water resources management? To explore this, we used temperature projections from the Community Earth System Model-Decadal Prediction Large Ensemble (CESM-DPLE) along with past basin runoff efficiency as covariates in a Random Forest (RF) method to project ensembles of multiyear mean flow at the key aggregate gauge of Lees Ferry, Arizona. RF streamflow projections outperformed both ESP and climatology in a 1982-2017 hindcast, as measured by ranked probability skill score. The projections were disaggregated to monthly and subbasin scales to drive the Colorado River Mid-term Modeling System (CRMMS) to generate ensembles of water management variables. The projections of pool elevations in Lakes Powell and Mead, the two largest U.S. reservoirs that are critical for water resources management in the basin, were found to reduce the hindcast median root mean square error by up to -20% and -30% at lead times of 48 and 60 months, respectively, relative to projections generated from ESP.

Regional hydrology and the downstream water flow in the rivers of Himalayan origin may change due to variations in snow and glacier melt in the region. This study examines the mid-21st century climate projections over western Himalayas from the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project Phase 5 (CMIP5) global climate models under Representative Concentration Pathways (RCP) scenarios (RCP4.5 and RCP8.5). All the global climate models used in the present analysis indicate that the study region would be warmer by mid-century. The temperature trends from all the models studied here are statistically significant at 95% confidence interval. Multi-model ensemble spreads show that there are large differences among the models in their projections of future climate with spread in temperature ranging from about 1.5 degrees C to 5 degrees C over various areas of western Himalayas in all the seasons. Spread in precipitation projections lies between 0.3 and 1 mm/day in all the seasons. Major shift in the timing of evaporation maxima and minima is noticed. The GFDL_ESM2G model products have been downscaled to Satluj River basin using the weather research and forecast (WRF) model and impact of climate change on streamflow has been studied. The reduction of precipitation during JJAS is expected to be > 3-6 mm/day in RCP8.5 as compared to present climate. It is expected that precipitation amount shall increase over Satluj basin in future (mid-21st century) The soil and water assessment tool (SWAT) model has been used to simulate the Satluj streamflow for the present and future climate using GFDL_ESM2G precipitation and temperature data as well as the WRF model downscaled data. The computations using the global model data show that total annual discharge from Satluj will be less in future than that in present climate, especially in peak discharge season (JJAS). The SWAT model with downscaled output indicates that during winter and spring, more discharge shall occur in future (RCP8.5) in Satluj River.","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.gloplacha.2017.10.013","10.1016/j.gloplacha.2017.10.013","Tiwari, Sarita; Kar, Sarat C.; Bhatla, R.","GLOBAL AND PLANETARY CHANGE",NA,"CLIMATE-CHANGE; NORTHWESTERN HIMALAYA; IMPACT ASSESSMENT; TIME-SERIES; PART II; PRECIPITATION; MODEL; HYDROLOGY; SNOW; STATIONARITY",NA,"ELSEVIER","AMSTERDAM","RADARWEG 29, 1043 NX AMSTERDAM, NETHERLANDS","0921-8181","1872-6364",NA,"GLOBAL PLANET CHANGE","Glob.

FALSE,29,"Forecast Informed Reservoir Operations Using Ensemble Streamflow Predictions for a Multipurpose Reservoir in Northern California","Ensemble Forecast Operations (EFO) is a risk-based approach of reservoir flood control operations that incorporates ensemble streamflow predictions (ESPs) made by the California-Nevada River Forecast Center. Reservoir operations for each member of an ESP are individually modeled to forecast system conditions and calculate risk of reaching critical operational thresholds. Reservoir release decisions are simulated to manage forecasted risk with respect to established risk tolerance levels. EFO was developed for Lake Mendocino, a 111,000 acre-foot reservoir near Ukiah, California, to evaluate its viability to improve reservoir storage reliability without increasing downstream flood risk. Lake Mendocino is a dual use reservoir, owned and operated for flood control by the United States Army Corps of Engineers and operated for water supply by Sonoma Water. EFO was simulated using a 26-year (1985-2010) ESP hindcast generated by the California-Nevada River Forecast Center, which provides 61-member ensembles of 15-day flow forecasts. EFO simulations yield generally higher storage levels during the flood management season while maintaining needed flood storage capacity by strategically prereleasing water in advance of forecasted storms. Model results demonstrate a 33% increase in median storage at the end of the flood management season (10 May) over existing operations without marked changes in flood frequency for locations downstream from Lake Mendocino. EFO may be a viable alternative for managing flood control operations at Lake Mendocino that provides multiple benefits (water supply, flood mitigation, and ecosystems) and provides a management framework that could be adapted and applied to other flood control reservoirs.","https://doi.org/10.1029/2019WR026604","10.1029/2019WR026604","Delaney, Chris J.; Hartman, Robert K.; Mendoza, John; Dettinger, Michael; Delle Monache, Luca; Jasperse, Jay; Ralph, F.

Part B: Designing the next monitoring-modelling-assessment cycle of adaptive management in Lake Erie","In Lake Erie, a wide variety of statistical and process-based models have significantly advanced our understanding of the major causal linkages/ecosystem processes underlying the local water quality problems. In this study, our aim is to identify knowledge gaps, monitoring assessment objectives, and management recommendations that should be critically reviewed through the iterative monitoring-modelling-assessment cycles of adaptive management. In the watershed, the presence of multiple SWAT applications provides assurance that a wide array of physical, chemical, and biological processes with distinct characterizations are used to reproduce the patterns of flow and nutrient export in agricultural lands. While there are models with more advanced mechanistic representation of certain facets of the hydrological cycle (surface runoff, groundwater and sediment erosion) or better equipped to depict urban settings, we believe that greater insights will be gained by revisiting several influential assumptions (tile drainage, fertilizer/manure application rates, land-use/landcover data) and recalibrating the existing SWAT models to capture both baseline and event-flow conditions and daily nutrient concentration (not loading) variability in multiple locations rather than a single downstream site. It is also critical to redesign land-use management scenarios by accommodating recent conceptual and technical advancements of their life-cycle effectiveness, the variability in their starting operational efficiency, and differential response to storm events or seasonality, as well as the role of legacy phosphorus. In the receiving waterbody, the development of data-driven models to establish causal linkages between the trophic status of Lake Erie and external phosphorus loading represents a pragmatic means to draw forecasts regarding the phyto-plankton community response to different management actions. Two critical next steps to further augment the empirical modelling work is the iterative updating as more data are acquired through monitoring and the introduction of additional explanatory variables that are likely associated with the occurrence of cyanobacteria-dominated blooms. The majority of the process-based models are not constrained by the available data, and therefore their primary value is their use as heuristic tools to advance our understanding of Lake Erie. The validation of their predictive power should become one of the overarching objectives of the iterative monitoring-modelling-assessment cycles. With respect to the projected responses of the system to nutrient loading reduction, we express our skepticism with the optimistic predictions of the extent and duration of hypoxia, given our limited knowledge of the sediment diagenesis processes in the central basin along with the lack of data related to the vertical profiles of organic matter and phosphorus fractionation or sedimentation/burial rates. Our study also questions the adequacy of the coarse spatiotemporal (seasonal/annual, basin- or lake-wide) scales characterizing the philosophy of both water quality management objectives and modelling enterprise in Lake Erie, as this strategy seems somewhat disconnected from the ecosystem services targeted. We conclude by emphasizing that the valuation of ecosystem services should be integrated into the decision-making process, as we track the evolution of the system over time.","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ecoinf.2019.05.015","10.1016/j.ecoinf.2019.05.015","Arhonditsis, George B.; Neumann, Alex; Shimoda, Yuko; Kim, Dong-Kyun; Dong, Feifei; Onandia, Gabriela; Yang, Cindy; Javed, Aisha; Brady, Meghan; Visha, Ariola; Ni, Felicity; Cheng, Vincent","ECOLOGICAL INFORMATICS","Lake Erie; Best management practices; Uncertainty analysis; Adaptive management implementation; Integrated modelling framework","INTEGRATIVE METHODOLOGICAL FRAMEWORK; ENVIRONMENTAL CRITERIA EVALUATION; LAURENTIAN GREAT-LAKES; HARMFUL ALGAL BLOOMS; WATER-QUALITY; ECOSYSTEM SERVICES; PHOSPHORUS LOADS; CURRENT STATE; HAMILTON HARBOR; NUTRIENT INPUTS",NA,"ELSEVIER","AMSTERDAM","RADARWEG 29, 1043 NX AMSTERDAM, NETHERLANDS","1574-9541","1878-0512",NA,"ECOL INFORM","Ecol.

TRUE,32,"Fishing in greener waters: Understanding the impact of harmful algal blooms on Lake Erie anglers and the potential for adoption of a forecast model","Harmful algal blooms (HABs) pose public health risks worldwide, because of the toxins that they can produce. Researchers have explored the impact of HABs on local economies, but know relatively little about the decision making that informs these behaviors that lead to financial losses. Understanding the factors that inform this decision-making is critical to developing mitigative solutions. This study seeks to understand how HABs in Western Lake Erie affect angler decision-making, before evaluating a possible decision-support tool a harmful algal bloom forecast known as the Experimental Lake Erie HAB Tracker. The HAB Tracker provides a nowcast and five-day forecast of the spatial distribution and transport of Microcystis, the predominant species of harmful algae in Western Lake Erie. Data collected using focus groups and surveys were coded to identify key themes that influence angler decision-making. The theory of the diffusion of innovations provides an analytical framework to evaluate the potential for widespread adoption of the HAB forecast among Lake Erie anglers. Analysis of emerging themes revealed that Lake Erie anglers face three key decision-points when fishing in HABs: whether to fish, where to fish, and whether to eat the fish. Five primary variables factored into angler decisions on where and whether to fish including 1) perceptions of HAB aesthetics, 2) perceptions of the impact of HABs on angler health, 3) perceptions of the impact of HABs on fish, 4) communication methods, 5) perceptions of HABs by customers of charter captains. Most participants in this study sought to avoid fishing in HABs primarily for aesthetic reasons. Recreational anglers are more likely than charter captains to adopt the HAS Tracker as a decision-support tool, because it is compatible with their information needs and provides a relative advantage over existing sources of information. Charter captains are less likely to adopt the HAB Tracker, because they rely on their existing knowledge and social network for HAB information. If researchers can reduce the complexity of forecast information while increasing its accessibility and reliability, then all anglers will be more likely to adopt a HAS forecast as a decision-support tool while fishing in Lake Erie during bloom season.","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jenvman.2018.08.074","10.1016/j.jenvman.2018.08.074","Gill, Devin; Rowe, Mark; Joshi, Sonia Joseph","JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL MANAGEMENT","Harmful algal bloom; Lake Erie; Fishing; Stakeholder engagement; HAB forecast","RISK PERCEPTION; CYANOBACTERIA; CONSUMPTION; FISHERMEN; LESSONS",NA,"ACADEMIC PRESS LTD- ELSEVIER SCIENCE LTD","LONDON","24-28 OVAL RD, LONDON NW1 7DX, ENGLAND","0301-4797","1095-8630",NA,"J ENVIRON MANAGE","J.

Answers to these questions are somewhat unclear but critical for designing ecological management strategies. Here we forecast potential impacts of climate change on freshwater lake fish communities of Ontario, Canada, by contrasting species composition, species richness, functional diversity and functional composition for present versus projected communities under best-case and business-as-usual climate change scenarios. Results indicate that the composition of projected communities differs from present, and includes a shift from cold- and cool-water species to warm-water species. Species richness in projected communities is estimated to increase by 60-81%, but functional diversity is estimated to decline. These projected communities are estimated to have on average 22% shorter mean body length, 38% lighter body weight and 36% less fecundity than present. Also, the present configuration of sport and commercially important fishes are projected to decline in their distribution, potentially impacting ecosystem services associated with commercial and recreational fisheries. Together, climate change may initiate a compositional shift that may result in an important shift in community functional structure, which is likely to affect important aquatic ecosystem services.","https://doi.org/10.1007/s10750-017-3208-1","10.1007/s10750-017-3208-1","Biswas, Shekhar R.; Vogt, Richard J.; Sharma, Sapna","HYDROBIOLOGIA","Compositional shift; Ecosystem services; Species distribution models; Trait analysis","FUNCTIONAL DIVERSITY; CHANGE IMPACTS; SPECIES DISTRIBUTION; DISTRIBUTION MODELS; POTENTIAL IMPACTS; BIODIVERSITY LOSS; THERMAL HABITAT; SMALLMOUTH BASS; ASSEMBLAGES; POPULATIONS",NA,"SPRINGER","DORDRECHT","VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS","0018-8158","1573-5117",NA,"HYDROBIOLOGIA","Hydrobiologia","SEP",2017,"799","1","135","149",NA,NA

TRUE,35,"Improving forecasting accuracy of river flow using gene expression programming based on wavelet decomposition and de-noising","Due to the effects of anthropogenic activities and natural climate change, streamflows of rivers have gradually decreased. In order to maintain reliable water supplies, reservoir operation and water resource management, accurate streamflow forecasts are very important. Based on monthly flow data from five hydrological stations in the middle and lower parts of the Hanjiang River Basin, between 1989 and 2009, we consider an efficient approach of adopting the gene expression programming model based on wavelet decomposition and de-noising (WDDGEP) to forecast river flow. Original flow time series data are initially decomposed into one sub-signal approximation and seven sub-signal details using the dmey wavelet. A wavelet threshold de-noising method is also applied in this study. Data that have been de-noised after decomposition are then adopted as inputs for WDDGEP models. Finally, the forecasted sub-signal results are summed to formulate an ensemble forecast for the original monthly flow series. A comparison of the prediction accuracy between the two models is based on three performance evaluation measures. Results show that the new WDDGEP models can effectively enhance accuracy in forecasting streamflow, and the proposed wavelet-based de-noising of the observed non-stationary time series is an effective measure to improve simulation accuracy.","https://doi.org/10.2166/nh.2017.115","10.2166/nh.2017.115","Lu, Xiaorong; Wang, Xuelei; Zhang, Liang; Zhang, Ting; Yang, Chao; Song, XinXin; Yang, Qing","HYDROLOGY RESEARCH","flow forecasting; gene expression programming; wavelet transformation; WDDGEP models","TIME-SERIES; PERFORMANCE; RUNOFF; TRANSFORM; RAINFALL; MODEL; RESPONSES; SUPPORT; GEP",NA,"IWA PUBLISHING","LONDON","ALLIANCE HOUSE, 12 CAXTON ST, LONDON SW1H0QS, ENGLAND","1998-9563","2224-7955",NA,"HYDROL RES","Hydrol.

However, it remains an enormous challenge to produce forecasts of water quality variables that are accurate enough to meet public demand. In this study, we developed and evaluated a new forecast framework for real-time forecasting of daily dissolved oxygen (DO), ammonium nitrogen (NH), total phosphorus (TP) and total nitrogen (TN) concentrations at lead times from one to six days for Lake Chaohu, the fifth largest freshwater lake in China. The forecast framework is based on a 3-D hydrodynamic ecological model referred to as EcoLake. We used hydrological, meteorological and water quality data from multiple sources to generate initial conditions and forcing functions. Solar radiation and inflows from tributaries which are not readily available were calculated using forecasted cloud cover and rainfall. Forecast skill was evaluated based on 122 forecasts produced on different days in 2017 and for each of the 12 sampling sites. Results indicate that the skill of the forecast framework varies considerably across water quality variables, sampling sites, and lead times. Generally, the forecast framework is more skillful than the persistence forecasts, which use the most recent observations as forecasts. The TN forecasts tend to be the most skillful with a mean RMSE skill score of 28.5% averaged across the six lead times. The DO forecasts tend to have the lowest skill with an average value of 10.9%. Model sensitivity experiments further revealed that errors in the raw air temperature and wind speed forecasts have a noticeable impact on the overall skill of DO and NH forecasts. The forecast framework proposed here could be a useful operational forecasting tool to enhance the effectiveness of the drinking water supply and public health protection based on the water quality management of Lake Chaohu.

In recent years niche-based models (NBMs) have been used to predict species distribution and are an important tool for conservation and management of aquatic ecosystems. In this work, the current and future climatic suitability areas of the invasive species Corbicula fluminea, which has known adverse ecological and economic impacts, were investigated. The species distribution modelling was based on nine algorithms in BIOMOD2, summarized in an ensemble forecasting approach. To model the species distribution, eight climatic parameters related to temperature and precipitation variables were considered. Three time frames (current, 2050 and 2070) were modelled using four increasing CO2 emission scenarios. The performance of individual models was excellent according to the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) and good to excellent according to true skill statistics (TSS). Annual mean temperature, minimum temperature of the coldest month and mean temperature of the coldest quarter were the most important variables predicting C. fluminea occurrence. Of the total continental area, 6.6% was predicted to be suitable for C. fluminea in current conditions. In the future, suitable area will increase from the current value of 6.6% to values from 9.4% to 12.6%, according to the 2050 projections and up to 12.7% in 2070 in high emission scenarios. Overall, the results indicate that climate change will favour the expansion of C. fluminea into new river basins, especially at higher latitudes, and that future climatic scenarios may double the suitable area for Corbicula fluminea.","https://doi.org/10.1002/aqc.2767","10.1002/aqc.2767","Gama, Mafalda; Crespo, Daniel; Dolbeth, Marina; Anastacio, Pedro Manuel","AQUATIC CONSERVATION-MARINE AND FRESHWATER ECOSYSTEMS","alien species; biodiversity; climate change; invertebrates; modelling; stream","FRESH-WATER CLAM; SPECIES DISTRIBUTION; INVASIVE BIVALVE; BIOLOGICAL INVASIONS; DREISSENA-POLYMORPHA; DISTRIBUTION MODELS; INLAND WATERS; DIE-OFFS; MULLER; RIVER",NA,"WILEY","HOBOKEN","111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA","1052-7613","1099-0755",NA,"AQUAT CONSERV","Aquat.

Effective prediction of possible impacts of climate change on groundwater reserves, a crucial water resource, could be of great importance for sustainable water management. In a comparative study, artificial neural network (ANN), least square support vector machine (LSSVM), and nonlinear autoregressive network with exogenous inputs (NARX) models was applied to evaluate possible impacts of three representative concentration pathways (RCP) climate change scenarios (RCP2.6, RCP4.5, RCP8.5) on groundwater levels in Tasuj Plain, Iran. Four general circulation models (GCM) was used to predict temperature and precipitation values for the future period 2022-2050 and found that future temperature increased, while the amount of precipitation decreased. To improve the accuracy of three models in groundwater level prediction, db4 wavelet transform was applied. The results indicated that the Wavelet-NARX approach gave the best accuracy in forecasting groundwater level in the study area. In all cases, prediction indicated that groundwater level in all representative wells would decline in future.","https://doi.org/10.1007/s12517-021-06508-6","10.1007/s12517-021-06508-6","Ghazi, Babak; Jeihouni, Esmaeil; Kalantari, Zahra","ARABIAN JOURNAL OF GEOSCIENCES","Climate change; Groundwater level; Artificial intelligence techniques; Tasuj plain","SUPPORT VECTOR MACHINE; NEURAL-NETWORK MODELS; POTENTIAL IMPACTS; SHABESTAR PLAIN; LAKE URMIA; LAND-USE; WAVELET; WATER; SIMULATION; QUALITY",NA,"SPRINGER HEIDELBERG","HEIDELBERG","TIERGARTENSTRASSE 17, D-69121 HEIDELBERG, GERMANY","1866-7511","1866-7538",NA,"ARAB J GEOSCI","Arab.

Its floodplain eco-system, which is strongly tied to seasonal flood pulse, is extremely important for food security, trade and economy of Cambodia, supporting the livelihoods of about 1.7 million people. On the other hand, flood can also be extremely devastating in the region along the TSL. In recent years, studies have pointed out that rapid growing number of water infrastructures as well as future climate changes may alter the hydrological cycle of the Mekong River Basin (MRB) and are expected to influence the flood pulse of the TSL and surrounding TSL floodplain. Therefore, it is timely to understand historical inundation extent and predict its likely future state. In this study, we proposed a Rotated Empirical Orthogonal Function (REOF) analysis-based daily inundation extent estimation framework, integrating multi-temporal stack of Sentinel-1A Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) imagery and Jason-series satellite altimetry data. The framework can generate daily, cloud-free and gap-free inundation extents for any given time depending on the altimetry data provided. A long-term El Nino and Southern Oscillation (ENSO) index-based daily TSL level forecasting method with months of lead time was also proposed to fulfill the framework's forecasting capacity. In this study, the framework was adopted in the TSL floodplain area for hindcast (2003 to 2015) and forecast (January to July 2019) of daily inundation extents. Estimated inundation extents were cross-compared with MODIS-derived and Sentinel-1-derived inundation maps, resulting in up to higher than 90% of Critical Success Index (CSI). The proposed framework has (1) innovative capacity of estimation of future daily areal inundation extents and is (2) a fully remote sensing-based framework which can empower local authorities tasked with water resource management decisions without relying on upstream countries. The framework has potential to be implemented in other major river basins or wetlands (e.g., Amazon River Basin, and Congo River Basin).

However, with aquifers stressed by overdraft, contamination from land use, and the hydrologic impacts of climate change, identifying reliable sources for new wells is increasingly challenging. Well forecasting is a process in which potential groundwater resources are evaluated for a location of interest. While this process forecasts the depth of each aquifer for a given location, it takes historical groundwater well data from nearby locations into account. Conventionally, well forecasting is done by geological survey professionals by manually analyzing the well data and, that makes the process both time and resource-intensive. This study presents a novel web application that performs well forecasting for any location within the state of Iowa in a matter of seconds utilizing client-side computing instead of expensive professional labor. The web application generates well forecasts by triangulating millions of combinations of historical aquifer depth data of nearby wells stored in a state-level database. The proposed web system also provides water quality information for arsenic, nitrate, and bacteria (total c and fecal coliform) on the same interface with forecasts.

FALSE,43,"Advancing lake and reservoir water quality management with near-term, iterative ecological forecasting","Near-term, iterative ecological forecasts with quantified uncertainty have great potential for improving lake and reservoir management. For example, if managers received a forecast indicating a high likelihood of impending impairment, they could make decisions today to prevent or mitigate poor water quality in the future. Increasing the number of automated, real-time freshwater forecasts used for management requires integrating interdisciplinary expertise to develop a framework that seamlessly links data, models, and cyberinfrastructure, as well as collaborations with managers to ensure that forecasts are embedded into decision-making workflows. The goal of this study is to advance the implementation of near-term, iterative ecological forecasts for freshwater management. We first provide an overview of FLARE (Forecasting Lake And Reservoir Ecosystems), a forecasting framework we developed and applied to a drinking water reservoir to assist water quality management, as a potential open-source option for interested users. We used FLARE to develop scenario forecasts simulating different water quality interventions to inform manager decision-making. Second, we share lessons learned from our experience developing and running FLARE over 2 years to inform other forecasting projects. We specifically focus on how to develop, implement, and maintain a forecasting system used for active management. Our goal is to break down the barriers to forecasting for freshwater researchers, with the aim of improving lake and reservoir management globally.","https://doi.org/10.1080/20442041.2020.1816421","10.1080/20442041.2020.1816421","Carey, Cayelan C.; Woelmer, Whitney M.; Lofton, Mary E.; Figueiredo, Renato J.; Bookout, Bethany J.; Corrigan, Rachel S.; Daneshmand, Vahid; Hounshell, Alexandria G.; Howard, Dexter W.; Lewis, Abigail S.

FALSE,44,"Developing the Coupled CWRF-FVCOM Modeling System to Understand and Predict Atmosphere-Watershed Interactions Over the Great Lakes Region","Coupling 3-D hydrodynamics with climate models is necessary but difficult for resolving multiscale interactions and has been rarely implemented in predicting Great Lakes' water level fluctuations because of issues in treating net basin supply (NBS) components and connecting channel flows. This study developed an interactive lake-atmosphere-hydrology modeling system by coupling the regional Climate-Weather Research and Forecasting model (CWRF) with the 3-D unstructured-grid Finite Volume Coastal Ocean Model (FVCOM) in the Great Lakes region. The sensitivity of the coupled system, relative to the CWRF baseline using the 1-D Lake, Ice, Snow and Sediment Simulator (LISSS), was evaluated in representing lake-climate conditions during 1999-2015 against observations. As coupled with CWRF, FVCOM outperformed LISSS in simulating water surface temperature, ice cover, and vertical thermal structure at seasonal to interannual scales for all the five lakes and realistically reproduced the regional circulation patterns. In warm seasons, the improved lake conditions significantly corrected LISSS overestimates of surface air temperature together with larger-scale circulation changes. Consequently, precipitation was generally reduced over each lake basin, mainly because of decreased surface moisture and heat fluxes along with enhanced atmospheric stability. Through the dynamic coupling, FVCOM predicts the water level fluctuations in direct response to the CWRF NBS components and connecting channel flows based on a stage-fall-discharge formulation. This coupled CWRF-FVCOM reasonably captured the NBS variations and predicted the water level fluctuations for Lakes Superior and Michigan-Huron. It represents a major advance in interacting regional climate and watershed processes to dynamically predict Great Lakes' water level seasonal-interannual variations. Plain Language Summary Coupling 3-D hydrodynamics with climate models is necessary but difficult for resolving multiscale interactions and has been rarely implemented in predicting Great Lakes' water level fluctuations because of issues in treating net basin supply (NBS) components and connecting channel flows. We developed an interactive lake-atmosphere- hydrology modeling system by coupling the regional Climate-Weather Research and Forecasting model (CWRF) with the 3-D unstructured-grid Finite Volume Coastal Ocean Model (FVCOM) and compared it with the baseline CWRF configured with 1-D lake model to understand how 3-D hydrodynamic processes affect the prediction of the lake and regional climate conditions. The coupled CWRF-FVCOM system significantly improved the simulation of all the five lakes' conditions at seasonal to interannual scales and realistically reproduced the regional circulation patterns. Our analysis also explained the processes that are associated with such sensitivity. Furthermore, as a unique contribution to the literature, we constructed FVCOM to dynamically predict the water level fluctuations in direct response to the coupled CWRF NBS components and connecting channel flows based on a stage-fall-discharge formulation.

FALSE,45,"The relative importance of environmental factors in predicting phytoplankton shifting and cyanobacteria abundance in regulated shallow lakes","The phytoplankton community can be affected by multiple environmental factors such as climate, meteorology, hydrology, nutrients, and grazing. The complex interactive effects of these environmental factors as well as the resilience of phytoplankton communities further make the prediction of phytoplankton communities' dynamics challenging. In this study, we analyzed multiple environmental factors and their relative importance in predicting both phytoplankton shifting and cyanobacteria abundance in two regulated shallow lakes in central China. Our results indicated that the phytoplankton community in the study areas could be mainly classified into 1. Cryptophyta dominated group, 2. Biologically diverse group, and 3. Cyanobacteria dominated group. The Multinomial Logistic Regression model indicated the Cryptophyta dominated group was sensitive to temperature, while other groups were sensitive to both temperature and nutrients. The interactive effects of temperature and nutrients were synergistic in the cyanobacteria dominated group, while they were antagonistic or minor in other groups. The Negative Binomial Regression model suggested high total phosphorus and low total nitrogen but not temperature were responsible for high cyanobacteria abundance. The conditional plot indicated nutrients affected cyanobacteria abundance more significantly under low wind speeds and lake volume fluctuations, and cyanobacteria abundance in the cyanobacteria dominated group maintained high levels with increasing hydrological dynamics. Our results demonstrated that environmental factors played inconsistently significant roles in different phytoplankton groups, and reducing nutrients could decrease adverse effects of warming and water project constructions. Our models can also be applied to forecast phytoplankton shifting and cyanobacteria abundance in the management of regulated shallow lakes.","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.envpol.2021.117555","10.1016/j.envpol.2021.117555","Rao, Ke; Zhang, Xiang; Wang, Mo; Liu, Jianfeng; Guo, Wenqi; Huang, Guangwei; Xu, Jing","ENVIRONMENTAL POLLUTION","Community prediction; Cyanobacteria blooms; Environmental drivers; Multinomial logistic regression; Negative binomial regression","CHLOROPHYLL-A; WATER-QUALITY; NUTRIENT LOAD; PHOSPHORUS; NITROGEN; EUTROPHICATION; TEMPERATURE; DOMINANCE; RESERVOIR; CLIMATE",NA,"ELSEVIER SCI LTD","OXFORD","THE BOULEVARD, LANGFORD LANE, KIDLINGTON, OXFORD OX5 1GB, OXON, ENGLAND","0269-7491","1873-6424",NA,"ENVIRON POLLUT","Environ.

Results indicate that shifts in the seasonality of precipitation and changing climatology are consistent with periods of overprediction and underprediction in streamflow forecasts. Multiple linear regression of SNOTEL data, postcedent precipitation, and land-cover changes explained 2%-18% more variability in streamflow prediction than using SNOTEL station data alone. Simulated basin-wide snowpack from a physically based model had significant negative trends in snow water equivalent (-4.33 mm/yr) and snow-covered area (-0.05%/yr) during the melt period April-June. Simulated streamflow from a precipitation-runoff model increased an average 5% when the effects of bark beetle-induced tree mortality were compared to a baseline simulation with static vegetation. The effects of a 2013 wildfire increased simulated seasonal streamflow an average 35% for 1-4 years postfire.

FALSE,47,"Application of Integrated Artificial Neural Networks Based on Decomposition Methods to Predict Streamflow at Upper Indus Basin, Pakistan","Consistent streamflow forecasts play a fundamental part in flood risk mitigation. Population increase and water cycle intensification are extending not only globally but also among Pakistan's water resources. The frequency of floods has increased in the last few decades in the country, which emphasizes the importance of efficient practices needed to adopt for various aspects of water resource management such as reservoir scheduling, water sustainability, and water supply. The purpose of this study is to develop a novel hybrid model for streamflow forecasting and validate its efficiency at the upper Indus basin (UIB), Pakistan. Maximum streamflow in the River Indus from its upper mountain basin results from melting snow or glaciers and climatic unevenness of both precipitation and temperature inputs, which will, therefore, affect rural livelihoods at both a local and a regional scale through effects on runoff in the Upper Indus basin (UIB). This indicates that basins receive the bulk of snowfall input to sustain the glacier system. The present study will help find the runoff from high altitude catchments and estimated flood occurrence for the proposed and constructed hydropower projects of the Upper Indus basin (UIB). Due to climate variability, the upper Indus basin (UIB) was further divided into three zone named as sub-zones, zone one (z1), zone two (z2), and zone three (z3). The hybrid models are designed by incorporating artificial intelligence (AI) models, which includes Feedforward backpropagation (FFBP) and Radial basis function (RBF) with decomposition methods. This includes a discrete wavelet transform (DWT) and ensemble empirical mode decomposition (EEMD). On the basis of the autocorrelation function and the cross-correlation function of streamflow, precipitation and temperature inputs are selected for all developed models. Data have been analyzed by comparing the simulation outputs of the models with a correlation coefficient (R), root mean square errors (RMSE), Nash-Sutcliffe Efficiency (NSE), mean absolute percentage error (MAPE), and mean absolute errors (MAE). The proposed hybrid models have been applied to monthly streamflow observations from three hydrological stations and 17 meteorological stations in the UIB. The results show that the prediction accuracy of the decomposition-based models is usually better than those of AI-based models. Among the DWT and EEMD based hybrid model, EEMD has performed significantly well when compared to all other hybrid and individual AI models. The peak value analysis is also performed to confirm the results' precision rate during the flood season (May-October). The detailed comparative analysis showed that the RBFNN integrated with EEMD has better forecasting capabilities as compared to other developed models and EEMD-RBF can capture the nonlinear characteristics of the streamflow time series during the flood season with more precision.","https://doi.org/10.3390/atmos9120494","10.3390/atmos9120494","Tayyab, Muhammad; Ahmad, Ijaz; Sun, Na; Zhou, Jianzhong; Dong, Xiaohua","ATMOSPHERE","artificial intelligence (AI); neural network (NN); Upper Indus Basin (UIB); feedforward backpropagation (FFBP); radial basis function (RBF); discrete wavelet transform (DWT); ensemble empirical mode decomposition (EEMD); eligible rate (ER)","IMPROVING FORECASTING ACCURACY; EMPIRICAL MODE DECOMPOSITION; CLIMATE-CHANGE; FLOOD FREQUENCY; WATER-RESOURCES; WAVELET MODEL; RIVER-BASIN; RUNOFF; RESERVOIR; SERIES",NA,"MDPI","BASEL","ST ALBAN-ANLAGE 66, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND",NA,"2073-4433",NA,"ATMOSPHERE-BASEL","Atmosphere","DEC",2018,"9","12",NA,NA,"494",NA
FALSE,48,"Robust multiobjective reservoir operation and risk decision-making model for real-time flood control coping with forecast uncertainty","Forecast uncertainty in real-time flood forecasting is the primary source of risk regarding reservoir flood control operation, affecting both reliability and safety of the entire system. Informing reservoir operation for real-time flood control coping with forecast uncertainty encourages overall robust control of risk probability, vulnerability, and resilience of upstream and downstream protection areas. Current stochastic programming models or chance constrained programming models (CCP) focuses on reducing either risk loss or vulnerability, thereby failing to ensure systematic control. This study established a robust multiobjective operation and risk decision-making model to inform reservoir operations. The proposed model includes three modules. First, a copula function was applied to capture multidimensional temporal dependences of forecast uncertainties, following which stochastic inflow scenarios were generated. Second, a robust multiobjective optimization (RMOO) model was established with the objectives of minimizing the probability of risk events, Conditional Value-at-Risk of risk loss (vulnerability) and the maximum sequential duration for both upstream and downstream areas. Then, an adaptive reference multiobjective evolutionary algorithm was used to solve the model and obtain noninferior solutions. Finally, the TOPSIS multicriteria decision-making method was introduced to select the compromise solution. Methodologies were verified by application to Xianghongdian reservoir, China. The main findings were as follows. (1) The copula function effectively captured the multidimensional positive temporal dependences of forecast uncertainties. (2) RMOO provided more widely distributed noninferior solutions than CCP, and performed better in lowering vulnerability of the system. (3) RMOO reduced the maximum release by 135.6 m(3)/s (7.33%) by increasing prerelease before the occurrence of flood peak. The proposed methodologies provide insights for supporting robust control of real-time operations of a reservoir system through simultaneous control of flood risk probability, vulnerability, and resilience.","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jhydrol.2021.127334","10.1016/j.jhydrol.2021.127334","Huang, Xin; Xu, Bin; Zhong, Ping-an; Yao, Hongyi; Yue, Hao; Zhu, Feilin; Lu, Qingwen; Sun, Yu; Mo, Ran; Li, Zhen; Liu, Weifeng","JOURNAL OF HYDROLOGY","Reservoir operation; Uncertainty; Multiobjective; Robust optimization; Conditional Value-at-Risk; Copula function","VALUE-AT-RISK; OF-THE-ART; STOCHASTIC OPTIMIZATION; SIMULATION; EVOLUTION",NA,"ELSEVIER","AMSTERDAM","RADARWEG 29, 1043 NX AMSTERDAM, NETHERLANDS","0022-1694","1879-2707",NA,"J HYDROL","J.

The approach followed in this study focuses on searching for potential predictors, reducing the pool of potential predictors by using multivariate statistical analysis, applying sequentially, Canonical Correlation Analysis, Principal Component Analysis, and multiple linear regression to robustly forecast the Nile flow. The proposed approach proved to be very useful for improving long-range Nile River flow forecasting.

FALSE,51,"Enhancing the Predictability of Seasonal Streamflow With a Statistical-Dynamical Approach","Seasonal streamflow forecasts facilitate water allocation, reservoir operation, flood risk management, and crop forecasting. They are generally computed by forcing hydrological models with outputs from general circulation models (GCMs) or using large-scale climate indices as predictors in statistical models. In contrast, hybrid statistical-dynamical forecasts (combining statistical methods with dynamical climate predictions) are still uncommon, and their skill is largely unknown. Here we conduct systematic forecasting of seasonal streamflow using eight GCMs from the North American Multi-Model Ensemble, 0.5-9.5 months ahead, at 290 stream gauges in the U.S. Midwest. Probabilistic forecasts are developed for low to high streamflow using predictors that reflect climatic and anthropogenic influences. Results indicate that GCM forecasts of climate and antecedent climatic conditions enhance seasonal streamflow predictability; while land cover and population density predictors decrease biases or enhance skill in certain catchments. This paper paves the way for novel forecasting approaches using dynamical GCM predictions within statistical frameworks. Plain Language Summary Streamflow forecasts several months ahead of a season are important for water management and the prevention of risks related to floods and hydrological droughts. However, existing methods for producing seasonal streamflow forecasts are often complex and computationally intensive. Here we provide a systematic evaluation of a statistical-dynamical approach to streamflow forecasting in several hundred river catchments across the U.S. Midwest. We assess whether global climate model forecasts can be used as predictors in statistical models to produce skillful forecasts of river flow, up to 10 months ahead. Results indicate that forecasts of rainfall and temperature, antecedent climatic conditions, as well as information on population density and land cover, can be used effectively to forecast streamflow at seasonal time scales. By including information on the future antecedent climatic conditions, streamflow forecasts can be enhanced months ahead. Information on human influences, in contrast, helps reduce the biases in the streamflow forecasts. These results pave the way for statistical-dynamical forecasting in catchments around the world and suggest that process-driven combinations of different predictors can be used to produce skillful streamflow forecasts in different seasons, for both high flows (i.e., floods) and low flows (i.e., representative of hydrological droughts).","https://doi.org/10.1029/2018GL077945","10.1029/2018GL077945","Slater, Louise J.; Villarini, Gabriele","GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH LETTERS","streamflow; forecast; NMME; precipitation; temperature; land cover","CENTRAL UNITED-STATES; PREDICTION SYSTEM; FORECASTS; CLIMATE; SCALE; MODELS; SKILL",NA,"AMER GEOPHYSICAL UNION","WASHINGTON","2000 FLORIDA AVE NW, WASHINGTON, DC 20009 USA","0094-8276","1944-8007",NA,"GEOPHYS RES LETT","Geophys.

The primary objective of this study was to evaluate the impact of snow data assimilation (DA) in a distributed hydrologic model on WSV forecasting error and skill in headwater catchments of the UCRB. To do this, a framework was built to use the Localized Ensemble transform Kalman filter to update modeled snow water equivalent (SWE) states in the Hydrology Laboratory-Research Distributed Hydrologic Model with SNOTEL SWE observations and spatially and temporally complete MODIS Snow Covered-Area and Grain size data. The DA approach was assessed by evaluating ensemble streamflow prediction forecasts over a 20-year period for 23 catchments in the UCRB. Overall, the DA approach improved water supply forecast skill in 80% of pilot basins with an average improvement in the median continuous rank probability skill score of 4%. A research-to-operations transition was facilitated by automating the implementation of the DA approach.

Based on three deterministic forecasts, the stochastic inflow scenarios were further developed using Bayesian model averaging (BMA) for quantifying uncertainty. The forecasting scheme was further coupled with a multi-reservoir optimization model, and the multi-objective programming was solved using the parameterized multi-objective robust decision-making (MORDM) approach. The AI-based management framework was applied and demonstrated over a multi-reservoir system (25 reservoirs) in the Zhoushan Islands, China. Three main conclusions were drawn from this study: (1) GRU and LSTM performed equally well on streamflow forecasts, and GRU might be the preferred method over LSTM, given that it had simpler structures and less modeling time; (2) higher forecast performance could lead to improved reservoir operation, while uncertain forecasts were more valuable than deterministic forecasts, regarding two performance metrics, i.e., water supply reliability and operating costs; (3) the relationship between the forecast horizon and reservoir operation was complex and depended on the operating configurations (forecast quality and uncertainty) and performance measures. This study reinforces the potential of an AI-based stochastic streamflow forecasting scheme to seek robust strategies under uncertainty.","https://doi.org/10.5194/hess-25-5951-2021","10.5194/hess-25-5951-2021","Guo, Yuxue; Yu, Xinting; Xu, Yue-Ping; Chen, Hao; Gu, Haiting; Xie, Jingkai","HYDROLOGY AND EARTH SYSTEM SCIENCES",NA,"ROBUST DECISION-MAKING; SHORT-TERM-MEMORY; ENSEMBLE MODEL; RIVER-BASIN; WATER; MANAGEMENT; UNCERTAINTY; RESOURCES; SKILL; PREDICTION",NA,"COPERNICUS GESELLSCHAFT MBH","GOTTINGEN","BAHNHOFSALLEE 1E, GOTTINGEN, 37081, GERMANY","1027-5606","1607-7938",NA,"HYDROL EARTH SYST SC","Hydrol.

TRUE,58,"Forecasting Daily Streamflow for Basins with Different Physical Characteristics through Data-Driven Methods","Modelling streamflow is essential for activities, such as flood control, drought mitigation, and water resources utilization and management. Artificial neural network (ANN), adaptive neuro-fuzzy inference system (ANFIS), and support vector machines (SVM) are techniques that are frequently used in hydrology to specifically model streamflow. This study compares the accuracy of ANN, ANFIS, and SVM in forecasting the daily streamflow with the traditional approach known as autoregressive (AR) model for basins with different physical characteristics. The accuracies of the models are compared for three basins, that is, 1801, 1805, and 1822, at the Seyhan River Basin in Turkey. The comparison was performed by using coefficient of efficiency, index of agreement, and root-mean-square error. Results indicate that ANN and ANFIS are more accurate than AR and SVM for all the basins. ANN and ANFIS perform similarly, while ANN outperformed ANFIS. Among the models used, the ANN demonstrates the highest performance in forecasting the peak flood values. This study also finds that physical characteristics, such as small area, high slope, and high elevation variation, and streamflow variance deteriorate the accuracy of the methods.","https://doi.org/10.1007/s11269-018-1998-1","10.1007/s11269-018-1998-1","Hadi, Sinan Jasim; Tombul, Mustafa","WATER RESOURCES MANAGEMENT","Artificial neural network; Adaptive neuro-fuzzy inference system; Support vector machines; Autoregression; Streamflow","ARTIFICIAL NEURAL-NETWORK; RIVER FLOW; PREDICTION; MODELS",NA,"SPRINGER","DORDRECHT","VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS","0920-4741","1573-1650",NA,"WATER RESOUR MANAG","Water Resour.

FALSE,59,"Development of an accurate model to predict the phenology of Atlantic salmon smolt spring migration","Changes in migration timing, resulting from the alteration in river continuity or the effect of climate change, can have major consequences on the population dynamics of diadromous fish. Forecasting the phenology of fish migration is thus critically important to implement management actions aimed at protecting fish during their migration. In this study, an 11-year monitoring survey of Atlantic salmon smolts (Salmo salar) from the Ourthe River, Belgium, was analysed within a European Special Area of Conservation to improve the understanding of environment-induced spring migration. A logistic model was fitted to forecast smolt migration and to calculate phenological indicators for management, i.e. the onset, end, and duration of migration, while accounting for the influence of photoperiod, water temperature, and hydrological conditions. The results indicated that the photo-thermal units accumulated by smolts above a 7 degrees C temperature threshold was a relevant proxy to reflect the synergistic effect between temperature and photoperiod on smolt migration. After integrating the effect of river flow pulses, the model accurately explained the inter-annual changes in migration timing (R-2= 0.95). The model predictions provide decisive management information to identify sensitive periods during which mitigation measures (e.g. hydropower turbine shutdown, river discharge management) should be conducted to promote smolt survival. The model was used to predict phenological characteristics under future scenarios of climate change. The results suggest a joint effect of hydrological alterations and water warming. Temperature increases of 1-4 degrees C were associated with earlier initiation of migration, 6-51 days earlier, and spring flood events greatly influenced the duration of the migration period. Accordingly, the combined effects of human-induced modifications of the hydrological regimes and increasing temperatures could result in a mismatch between the smolt and favourable survival conditions in the marine environment.","https://doi.org/10.1002/aqc.3382","10.1002/aqc.3382","Teichert, Nils; Benitez, Jean-Philippe; Dierckx, Arnaud; Tetard, Stephane; de Oliveira, Eric; Trancart, Thomas; Feunteun, Eric; Ovidio, Michael","AQUATIC CONSERVATION-MARINE AND FRESHWATER ECOSYSTEMS","climate change; disturbance; engineering; fish; hydroecology; hydropower; migration; river","AUTUMN DOWNSTREAM MIGRATION; FRESH-WATER; SEAWARD MIGRATION; GROWTH-HORMONE; SALAR L.; TEMPERATURE; BEHAVIOR; SURVIVAL; PARR; PHOTOPERIOD",NA,"WILEY","HOBOKEN","111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA","1052-7613","1099-0755",NA,"AQUAT CONSERV","Aquat.

Accurate and reliable forecasting plays an important role in the optimal management of water resources. Numerous studies have shown that decomposition integration models have good prediction capacity. Considering the nonlinearity and unsteady state of daily incoming flow data, a hybrid model of adaptive variational mode decomposition (VMD) and bidirectional long- and short-term memory (Bi-LSTM) based on energy entropy was developed for daily inflow forecast. The model was analyzed using the mean absolute error (MAE), the root means square error (RMSE), Nash-Sutcliffe efficiency coefficient (NSE), and correlation coefficient (r). A historical daily inflow series of the Baozhusi Hydropower Station, China, is investigated by the proposed VMD-BiLSTM with hybrid models. For comparison, BP, GRNN, ELMAN, SVR, LSTM, Bi-LSTM, EMD-LSTM, and VMD-LSTM, were adopted and analyzed for evaluation and analyzed. We found that the proposed model, with MAE = 38.965, RMSE = 64.783, and NSE = 95.7%, was superior to the other models. Therefore, the hybrid model is robust and efficient for forecasting highly nonstationary and nonlinear streamflow. It can be used as the preferred data-driven tool to predict the daily inflow flow, which can ensure the safe operation of hydropower stations in reservoirs. As an interdisciplinary field spanning both machine learning and hydrology, daily inflow forecasting can become an important breakthrough in the application of deep learning to hydrology.","https://doi.org/10.1007/s11269-021-02879-3","10.1007/s11269-021-02879-3","Li, Fugang; Ma, Guangwen; Chen, Shijun; Huang, Weibin","WATER RESOURCES MANAGEMENT","Daily inflow forecasting; Deep learning; Energy entropy; Variational mode decomposition; K-mean; Bi-directional long- and short-term memory (Bi-LSTM)","NEURAL-NETWORK; ALGORITHM; RUNOFF; STREAMFLOW",NA,"SPRINGER","DORDRECHT","VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS","0920-4741","1573-1650",NA,"WATER RESOUR MANAG","Water Resour.

The presence of low-frequency structures in hydrologic time series is an important feature. It can modify the probability of extreme events occurring in different time scales, which makes the risk associated with extreme events dynamic, changing from one decade to another. This article proposes a methodology capable of dynamically detecting and predicting low-frequency streamflow (16-32 years), which presented significance in the wavelet power spectrum. The Standardized Runoff Index (SRI), the Pruned Exact Linear Time (PELT) algorithm, the breaks for additive seasonal and trend (BFAST) method, and the hidden Markov model (HMM) were used to identify the shifts in low frequency. The HMM was also used to forecast the low frequency. As part of the results, the regime shifts detected by the BFAST approach are not entirely consistent with results from the other methods. A common shift occurs in the mid-1980s and can be attributed to the construction of the reservoir. Climate variability modulates the streamflow low-frequency variability, and anthropogenic activities and climate change can modify this modulation. The identification of shifts reveals the impact of low frequency in the streamflow time series, showing that the low-frequency variability conditions the flows of a given year.","https://doi.org/10.3390/w12072058","10.3390/w12072058","Rafael Rolim, Larissa Zaira; de Souza Filho, Francisco de Assis","WATER","streamflow; low-frequency variability; regime shift; hydrological prediction; Sobradinho dam","CLIMATE-CHANGE; TRENDS; RIVER; RAINFALL; BRAZIL; PRECIPITATION; VARIABILITY; COMPUTATION; TUTORIAL; RUNOFF",NA,"MDPI","BASEL","ST ALBAN-ANLAGE 66, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND",NA,"2073-4441",NA,"WATER-SUI","Water","JUL",2020,"12","7",NA,NA,"2058",NA

FALSE,63,"Variance decomposition of forecasted sediment transport in a lowland watershed using global climate model ensembles","Forecasting change in sediment transport using global climate model ensembles is under-developed in the hydrology community due to a lack of knowledge regarding the variance structure of predictions. We investigate the uncertainty of forecast sediment transport from sources, including global climate model realizations, global climate model ensemble design, forecasted hydrologic inputs, and hydrologic modeling parameterization. We then forecast sediment transport for the gently rolling watershed in Kentucky, USA. Contrary to past research forecasting hydrology with global climate models, hydrologic model parameterization was the most significant source of variance impacting forecasted sediment transport variables. Forecast of sediment transport responses shows the propagation of uncertainty from the hydrologic model parameterization was over two times greater than the uncertainty from the selected global climate model realizations. This result emphasizes researchers focused on forecasting sediment transport with global climate models may need to give as much, or more, consideration to their water-sediment linkages as climate-water-sediment linkages. Hydrologic inputs from climate change, including forecast precipitation, temperature, relative humidity, solar radiation, and wind speed, impacted sediment transport. Considering changes in precipitation and temperature alone under-predicts streamflow and sediment transport by 49% and 35%, respectively, compared to including all meteorological variables inputs. Variance introduced across the three different global climate model ensembles was a relatively small source of variance impacting forecasted streamflow or sediment yield. The results suggest a quantitative effort by the researcher to design the global climate model ensemble by considering representativeness, historical performance, and independency will lead to robust results. Ensemble average forecasts forecast streamflow and sediment yield to increase by 19% and 14%, respectively, for the lowland watershed.

The advancement and availability of the seasonal flow forecasts provide the opportunity for reservoir operators to use flexible and early impoundment operation rules (EIOR). These flexible impoundment rules can significantly improve water conservation, particularly during dry years. In this study, we investigate the potential application of seasonal streamflow forecasts for employing EIOR in the upper Yangtze River basin. We first define thresholds to determine the streamflow condition in September, which is an important period for decision-making in the basin, and then select the most suitable impoundment operation rules accordingly. The thresholds are used in a simulation-optimization model to evaluate different scenarios for EIOR and SIOR by multiple objectives. We measure the skill of the GloFAS-Seasonal forecast, an operational global seasonal river flow forecasting system, to predict streamflow condition according to the selected thresholds. The results show that: (1) the 20th and 30th percentiles of the historical September flow are suitable thresholds for evaluating the possibility of employing EIOR; (2) compared to climatological forecasts, GloFAS-Seasonal forecasts are skillful for predicting the streamflow condition according to the selected 20th and 30th percentile thresholds; and (3) during dry years, EIOR could improve the fullness storage rate by 5.63% and the annual average hydropower generation by 4.02%, without increasing the risk of flooding.

FALSE,67,"Inferred inflow forecast horizons guiding reservoir release decisions across the United States","Medium- to long-range forecasts often guide reservoir release decisions to support water management objectives, including mitigating flood and drought risks. While there is a burgeoning field of science targeted at improving forecast products and associated decision support models, data describing how and when forecasts are applied in practice remain undeveloped. This lack of knowledge may prevent hydrological modelers from developing accurate reservoir release schemes for large-scale, distributed hydrology models that are increasingly used to assess the vulnerabilities of large regions to hydrological stress. We address this issue by estimating seasonally varying, regulated inflow forecast horizons used in the operations of more than 300 dams throughout the conterminous United States (CONUS). For each dam, we take actual forward observed inflows (perfect foresight) as a proxy for forecasted flows available to the operator and then identify for each week of the year the forward horizon that best explains the release decisions taken. Resulting horizon curves specify for each dam the inferred inflow forecast horizon as a function of the week of the water year. These curves are analyzed for strength of evidence for contribution of medium- to long-range forecasts in decision making. We use random forest classification to estimate that approximately 80% of large dams and reservoirs in the US (1553 +/- 50 out of 1927 dams with at least 10 Mm(3) storage capacity) adopt medium- to long-range inflow forecasts to inform release decisions during at least part of the water year. Long-range forecast horizons (more than 6 weeks ahead) are detected in the operations of reservoirs located in high-elevation regions of the western US, where snowpack information likely guides the release. A simulation exercise conducted on four key western US reservoirs indicates that forecast-informed models of reservoir operations may outperform models that neglect the horizon curve - including during flood and drought conditions.","https://doi.org/10.5194/hess-24-1275-2020","10.5194/hess-24-1275-2020","Turner, Sean W.

As the mechanism of algal blooms is not understood, the construction of prediction model mainly depends on statistical data. Therefore, knowledge on prior bloom occurrence derived from statistical data plays a significant role in establishing a prediction model. In this study, a naive Bayesian model incorporating prior information was constructed to predict algal bloom occurrence probabilities 1-7 days in advance under different weather conditions in Dianchi Lake. The proposed model utilised the following data from the MODIS images, the floating algae index (FAI) for the previous 7 days and five meteorological variables (mean wind speed, air pressure, relative humidity on the prediction day, accumulated sunshine hours in the previous 3 days, and accumulated air temperature in the previous 7 days). The prior probabilities of each pixel were calculated on a monthly timescale to highlight the bloom's temporal-spatial differences, and the 1-7 day posterior probabilities were calculated by combining the prior and conditional probabilities. The predictive effect was tested by the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC), and the results showed the number of pixels with estimation predictions classified as 'Good+' and 'Excellent' were 91.3%, 91.4%, 82.7%, 83.3%, 89.0%, 86.6%, and 90.0% for the predictions on days 1-7, respectively. Additionally, the independent validation datasets showed that the percentage of correctly classified instances (CCI%) of approximately 90% of the pixels were greater than 50%.

The inherent uncertainty in inflow forecasts however means that it remains a challenge to balance the risks of flooding against those of water shortages. Few studies have examined how the risks of floods and water shortages can be managed using reservoir operation rules. In this study, a two-phase stochastic optimization model was built to determine the optimal conservation level for flood water by minimizing the risks from both floods and water shortages. For the optimal condition, hedging rules were analytically derived as a quasi-linear function of the storage capability and the expected water shortage. The rules indicate that the flood water conservation was achieved when the marginal upstream flood risk was equal to the marginal water shortage risk, and that the limits of three operation zones divided by the expected water availability should be used when determining the water release. The results from testing the model with data from the Xianghongdian Reservoir (China) showed that the hedging rules outperformed the capacity-constrained pre-release rules for conserving flood water without increasing the flood risk. This proposed methodology will inform the process for making decisions about how to operate reservoirs to ensure optimal real-time flood water conservation.","https://doi.org/10.1007/s11269-020-02571-y","10.1007/s11269-020-02571-y","Xu, Bin; Huang, Xin; Zhong, Ping-an; Wu, Yenan","WATER RESOURCES MANAGEMENT","Reservoir operation; Flood water conservation; Hedging rules; Risky decision-making; First-order optimality condition",NA,NA,"SPRINGER","DORDRECHT","VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS","0920-4741","1573-1650",NA,"WATER RESOUR MANAG","Water Resour.

FALSE,70,"Future projections of water level and thermal regime changes of a multipurpose subtropical reservoir (Sao Paulo, Brazil)","The increase in global air temperatures as well as variability in rainfall shifts due to climate change has been affecting the dynamics of water level fluctuations and thermal regimes in lakes and reservoirs. It is expected that at the end of this decade, such impacts will be even more noticeable and may harm the inland waters use. However, little is known about the possible consequences of climate change in multipurpose subtropical reservoirs. Using data generated by a regionalized climate model (RCM) as input to a simple hydrological model and a one-dimensional vertical hydrodynamic model, we forecast potential changes in the Itupararanga reservoir, Sao Paulo, Brazil, in an exemplary time period (2028-2030) in the next decade. Two Representative Concentration Pathway (RCP) scenarios were considered: an optimistic one corresponding to a CO2 increase of about 650 ppm (RCP 4.5) and a pessimistic scenario where CO2 exceeds 1000 ppm in 2100 (RCP 8.5). We found a significant reduction in the reservoir water level for both scenarios of 35% compared to current conditions. The surface water temperature is expected to increase (+0.6 degrees C); on the other hand, there would be a cooling of the hypolimnion (RCP 4.5=-0.3 degrees C; RCP 8.5=-1.2 degrees C). Another consequence is an increase of the duration of stratification periods that would start earlier in the dry period (between July and August), as well as the intensification of the stability of the water column (+43% compared to current conditions) and a deepening of the thermocline. The hydrodynamic modeling results suggest that the water level drop may threaten the reservoir multiple uses, in particular drinking water supply and power generation. Furthermore, the heating of surface water layers and increase of the number of stratified days and thermal stability can have negative impacts on water quality. (C) 2021 Elsevier B.V.

FALSE,71,"Understanding and seasonal forecasting of hydrological drought in the Anthropocene","Hydrological drought is not only caused by natural hydroclimate variability but can also be directly altered by human interventions including reservoir operation, irrigation, groundwater exploitation, etc. Understanding and forecasting of hydrological drought in the Anthropocene are grand challenges due to complicated interactions among climate, hydrology and humans. In this paper, five decades (1961-2010) of naturalized and observed streamflow datasets are used to investigate hydrological drought characteristics in a heavily managed river basin, the Yellow River basin in north China. Human interventions decrease the correlation between hydrological and meteorological droughts, and make the hydrological drought respond to longer time-scales of meteorological drought. Due to large water consumptions in the middle and lower reaches, there are 118-262% increases in the hydrological drought frequency, up to 8-fold increases in the drought severity, 21-99% increases in the drought duration and the drought onset is earlier. The non-stationarity due to anthropogenic climate change and human water use basically decreases the correlation between meteorological and hydrological droughts and reduces the effect of human interventions on hydrological drought frequency while increasing the effect on drought duration and severity. A set of 29-year (1982-2010) hindcasts from an established seasonal hydrological forecasting system are used to assess the forecast skill of hydrological drought. In the naturalized condition, the climate-model-based approach outperforms the climatology method in predicting the 2001 severe hydrological drought event. Based on the 29-year hindcasts, the former method has a Brier skill score of 11-26% against the latter for the probabilistic hydrological drought forecasting. In the Anthropocene, the skill for both approaches increases due to the dominant influence of human interventions that have been implicitly incorporated by the hydrological postprocessing, while the difference between the two predictions decreases. This suggests that human interventions can outweigh the climate variability for the hydrological drought forecasting in the Anthropocene, and the predictability for human interventions needs more attention.","https://doi.org/10.5194/hess-21-5477-2017","10.5194/hess-21-5477-2017","Yuan, Xing; Zhang, Miao; Wang, Linying; Zhou, Tian","HYDROLOGY AND EARTH SYSTEM SCIENCES",NA,"STANDARDIZED PRECIPITATION INDEX; YELLOW-RIVER BASIN; SOIL-MOISTURE; WATER-RESOURCES; CLIMATE-CHANGE; SURFACE-WATER; STREAMFLOW; PREDICTION; SYSTEM; SKILL",NA,"COPERNICUS GESELLSCHAFT MBH","GOTTINGEN","BAHNHOFSALLEE 1E, GOTTINGEN, 37081, GERMANY","1027-5606","1607-7938",NA,"HYDROL EARTH SYST SC","Hydrol.

FALSE,73,"Real-time reservoir operation using recurrent neural networks and inflow forecast from a distributed hydrological model","Large-scale reservoirs play an essential role in water resources management for agriculture irrigation, water supply and flood controls. However, we need robust reservoir operation systems under both normal flow and extreme flow conditions. In this study, we applied recurrent neural networks (RNN) to simulate the operation of three multi-purpose reservoirs located in the upper Chao Phraya River basin. Two reservoirs have the function of multiannual flow regulation and one has the function of incomplete annual regulation. The goal of this study is to explore the applicability of RNN models for operation of reservoirs with multiannual flow regulation under different flow regimes, especially under extreme floods and droughts. We used three RNNs, namely nonlinear autoregressive models with exogenous input (NARX), long short-term memory (LSTM) and genetic algorithm based NAXR (GA-NAXR) for reservoir operation based on historical data. For real-time water resources management, an accurate inflow forecast is required to provide a real-time reservoir outflow, and thus we also carried out a real-time reservoir operation using the RNN and the inflow forecast by a distributed hydrological model. Results show that (1) GA-NARX has the highest accuracy among three RNNs and is more stable than the original NARX by optimizing the initial conditions, although it takes longer training time than NARX and LSTM; (2) GA-NARX-based operation model is effective under extreme floods and droughts; and (3) the real-time operation system combining the GA-NARX and the distributed hydrological model has reasonable accuracy in both wet season and dry season. RNN-based operation model developed in this study has potential applicability in practical water management, and the model combining the hydrological prediction is specially useful for real-time reservoir operation.","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jhydrol.2019.124229","10.1016/j.jhydrol.2019.124229","Yang, Shuyu; Yang, Dawen; Chen, Jinsong; Zhao, Baoxu","JOURNAL OF HYDROLOGY","Recurrent neural networks; Real-time reservoir operation; Inflow forecast by distributed hydrological model; The upper Chao Phraya River basin","SUPPORT VECTOR MACHINE; PHRAYA RIVER-BASIN; GENETIC ALGORITHM; SHORT-TERM; GLOBAL OPTIMIZATION; SERIES PREDICTION; CLIMATE; SYSTEM; FLOOD; INTEGRATION",NA,"ELSEVIER","AMSTERDAM","RADARWEG 29, 1043 NX AMSTERDAM, NETHERLANDS","0022-1694","1879-2707",NA,"J HYDROL","J.

In 2011, heavy rainfall from May until October resulted in the largest flood event in the history of Thailand. This event created difficulty for water managers, who lacked information to make predictions. Studies on the 2011 Thai flood have proposed alternative reservoir operations for flood mitigation. However, no study to date has used predictive information to determine how to control reservoirs and mitigate such extreme floods. Thus, the objective of this study is to update and develop a method for using streamflow predictive data to support adaptive reservoir operation with the aim of mitigating the 2011 flood. The study area was the Chao Phraya River Basin, one of the most important basins in Thailand. We obtained predictive information from a hydrological model with a reservoir operation module using an ensemble of seasonal precipitation data from the European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts (ECMWF). The six-month ECMWF prediction period was used to support the operation plan for mitigating flooding in 2011 around each reservoir during the wet season. Decision-making for reservoir operation based on seasonal predictions was conducted on a monthly time scale. The results showed that peak river discharge decreased slightly, by around 4%, when seasonal predictive data were used. Moreover, changing the reservoir operation plan and using seasonal predictions decreased the peak river discharge by around 20%.","https://doi.org/10.3390/w12113210","10.3390/w12113210","Kompor, Wongnarin; Yoshikawa, Sayaka; Kanae, Shinjiro","WATER","adaptive reservoir operation; ECMWF predictive data; H08 model; reservoir operation; river management; streamflow prediction; Thailand","OPTIMIZATION MODEL; GENETIC ALGORITHM; SOIL-MOISTURE; CLIMATE; SKILL; PRECIPITATION",NA,"MDPI","BASEL","ST ALBAN-ANLAGE 66, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND",NA,"2073-4441",NA,"WATER-SUI","Water","NOV",2020,"12","11",NA,NA,"3210",NA

Statistical forecasting methods based on regressing summer flow against spring snow water equivalent, precipitation, and antecedent runoff are thus becoming increasingly inadequate for water-resources decision making, which can lead to missed opportunities in maximizing beneficial uses, including the value of hydropower resources. An enhanced forecasting method using a process-based model and spatially distributed wireless sensor data offers more accurate runoff forecasts. In this paper, we assessed the forecasting accuracy of these two forecasting methods by applying them to two tributaries within the North Fork Feather River basin in California. The result shows the enhanced forecasting method having better accuracy than the statistical model. In addition, a hydropower simulation showed a considerable increase in energy value with the enhanced forecasting informing reservoir operations. The investment analysis on applying this method shows an average internal rate of return of 31% across all scenarios, making this forecasting method an attractive way to better inform water-related decisions for hydropower generation in the context of climate change.","https://doi.org/10.3390/w13162260","10.3390/w13162260","Guo, Han; Conklin, Martha; Maurer, Tessa; Avanzi, Francesco; Richards, Kevin; Bales, Roger","WATER","climate change; hydrology forecast; hydropower","CLIMATE-CHANGE IMPACTS",NA,"MDPI","BASEL","ST ALBAN-ANLAGE 66, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND",NA,"2073-4441",NA,"WATER-SUI","Water","AUG",2021,"13","16",NA,NA,"2260",NA
FALSE,76,"A Near-Term Iterative Forecasting System Successfully Predicts Reservoir Hydrodynamics and Partitions Uncertainty in Real Time","Freshwater ecosystems are experiencing greater variability due to human activities, necessitating new tools to anticipate future water quality. In response, we developed and deployed a real-time iterative water temperature forecasting system (FLARE-Forecasting Lake And Reservoir Ecosystems). FLARE is composed of water temperature and meteorology sensors that wirelessly stream data, a data assimilation algorithm that uses sensor observations to update predictions from a hydrodynamic model and calibrate model parameters, and an ensemble-based forecasting algorithm to generate forecasts that include uncertainty. Importantly, FLARE quantifies the contribution of different sources of uncertainty (driver data, initial conditions, model process, and parameters) to each daily forecast of water temperature at multiple depths. We applied FLARE to Falling Creek Reservoir (Vinton, Virginia, USA), a drinking water supply, during a 475-day period encompassing stratified and mixed thermal conditions. Aggregated across this period, root mean square error (RMSE) of daily forecasted water temperatures was 1.13 degrees C at the reservoir's near-surface (1.0 m) for 7-day ahead forecasts and 1.62 degrees C for 16-day ahead forecasts. The RMSE of forecasted water temperatures at the near-sediments (8.0 m) was 0.87 degrees C for 7-day forecasts and 1.20 degrees C for 16-day forecasts. FLARE successfully predicted the onset of fall turnover 4-14 days in advance in two sequential years. Uncertainty partitioning identified meteorology driver data as the dominant source of uncertainty in forecasts for most depths and thermal conditions, except for the near-sediments in summer, when model process uncertainty dominated. Overall, FLARE provides an open-source system for lake and reservoir water quality forecasting to improve real-time management.","https://doi.org/10.1029/2019WR026138","10.1029/2019WR026138","Thomas, R.

FALSE,77,"Coupling large-scale climate indices with a stochastic weather generator to improve long-term streamflow forecasts in a Canadian watershed","This paper aims at improving long-term streamflow forecasts by implementing a novel technique based on conditioning the parameters of a stochastic weather generator on large-scale climate indices, with varying lengths of training periods during the establishment of correlations. The most important climate indices are identified by looking at yearly correlations between a set of 40 indices and meteorological data (precipitation and temperature) at the watershed scale. A linear model is then constructed to identify precipitation and temperature anomalies to induce perturbations in the stochastic weather generator. Time windows of 5, 10, 15, 20 and 30 years are used in determining the optimal linear model. The performance of the proposed approach is assessed against that of a resampling of past climatology and using the same stochastic weather generator unconditioned on climate indices. Each member of the ensemble weather forecast is then fed to a hydrological model to create the Ensemble Streamflow Forecasts (ESF) with a one-year forecasting horizon. The three approaches are tested in hindcast mode over a 30-year period at 12 forecast dates. Results show that temperatures are significantly correlated with large-scale climate indices, whereas precipitation is only weakly related to the same indices. The length of the time window has a considerable impact on the prediction ability of the linear models. The precipitation models based on short duration time windows performed better than those based on longer windows, while the reverse was found for the temperature models. A comparison between all three Ensemble Streamflow Forecast approaches is assessed using the Continuous Ranked Probability Score (CRPS) metric. Results show that the proposed method improves long-term streamflow forecasting, particularly the volumetric bias and the peak flows during the spring flood.","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jhydrol.2020.125925","10.1016/j.jhydrol.2020.125925","Sohrabi, Samaneh; Brissette, Francois P.; Arsenault, Richard","JOURNAL OF HYDROLOGY","Long-term streamflow forecast; Large-scale climate indices; Stochastic weather generator; Non-stationarity","LOW-FREQUENCY VARIABILITY; ENSEMBLE KALMAN FILTER; MODEL PARAMETERS; PRECIPITATION; PREDICTION; TEMPERATURE; SIMULATION; TIME; IMPACTS; ENSO",NA,"ELSEVIER","AMSTERDAM","RADARWEG 29, 1043 NX AMSTERDAM, NETHERLANDS","0022-1694","1879-2707",NA,"J HYDROL","J.

Accurate flood forecasting can provide important information for optimal reservoir operation. Generally, the characteristic of precipitation spatial distribution is analyzed based on observation of several discreet preset stations. This cannot catch the rainstorm center all the time and will lead to deviation in the characteristic of precipitation spatial distribution. Therefore, it can hardly arrive at optimal sub-watershed delineation and flood modeling. Therefore, a novel method is proposed for analysis of characteristic of precipitation spatial distribution in consideration of rainfall distribution and the delay of rainfall-runoff concentration. Based on the analysis results of precipitation spatial distribution, several key sub-basins which have significant impact on the flood process can be recognized. And then the elaborate sub-watershed delineation and flood modeling approach is put forward consequently on these key sub-basins. The efficacy of the proposed method is estimated on the flood forecasting of Zhexi reservoir watershed. The results verify that the proposed method can significantly improve the flood forecasting precision, which can provide important decision-making basis for reservoir operation.","https://doi.org/10.1007/s11069-017-3017-x","10.1007/s11069-017-3017-x","Lu, Jiazheng; Guo, Jun; Yang, Li; Xu, Xunjian","NATURAL HAZARDS","Reservoir watershed; Flood forecasting; Sub-watershed delineation; Nash coefficient","ARTIFICIAL NEURAL-NETWORK; XINANJIANG MODEL; OPTIMIZATION",NA,"SPRINGER","NEW YORK","233 SPRING ST, NEW YORK, NY 10013 USA","0921-030X","1573-0840",NA,"NAT HAZARDS","Nat.

The CVQR model is applied to the Xiangxi River basin that is located in the Three Gorges Reservoir area in China for monthly streamflow forecasting. Multiple linear regression (MLR) and artificial neural network (ANN) are also compared to illustrate the applicability of CVQR. The results show that the CVQR model performs best in the calibration period for monthly streamflow prediction. The results also indicate that MLR has the worst effects in extreme quantile (flood events) and confidence interval predictions. Moreover, the performance of ANN tends to be overestimated in the process of peak prediction. Notably, CVQR is the most effective at capturing upper tail dependences among the hydrometeorological variables (i.e., floods).

FALSE,81,"Forecasting the evolution in the mixing regime of a deep subalpine lake under climate change scenarios through numerical modelling (Lake Maggiore, Northern Italy/Southern Switzerland)","The impact of air temperature rise is eminent for the large deep lakes in the Italian subalpine district, climate change being caused there by both natural phenomena and anthropogenic greenhouse-gases (GHG) emissions. These oligomictic lakes are experiencing a decrease in the frequency of winter full turnover and an intensification of stability. As a result, hypolimnetic oxygen concentrations are decreasing and nutrients are accumulating in bottom water, with effects on the whole ecosystem functioning. Forecasting the future evolution of the mixing pattern is relevant to assess if a reduction in GHG releases would be able to revert such processes. The study focuses on Lake Maggiore, for which the thermal structure evolution under climate change in the 2016-2085 period was assessed through numerical simulations, performed with the General Lake Model (GLM). Different prospects of regional air temperature rise were considered, given by the Swiss Climate Change Scenarios CH2011. Multiple realisations were performed for each scenario to obtain robust statistical predictions, adopting random series of meteorological data produced with the Vector-Autoregressive Weather Generator (VG). Results show that a reversion in the increasing thermal stability would be possible only if global GHG emissions started to be reduced by similar to 2020, allowing an equilibrium mixing regime to be restored by the end of the twenty-first century. Otherwise, persistent lack of complete-mixing, severe water warming and extensive effects on water quality are to be expected for the centuries to come. These projections can be extended to the other lakes in the subalpine district.","https://doi.org/10.1007/s00382-018-4094-6","10.1007/s00382-018-4094-6","Fenocchi, Andrea; Rogora, Michela; Sibilla, Stefano; Ciampittiello, Marzia; Dresti, Claudia","CLIMATE DYNAMICS","Climate change impact; Inland waters warming; Hydrodynamic modelling; Full turnover; Swiss climate change scenarios CH2011; Weather generator","TEMPERATURE PROFILES; WATER TEMPERATURES; THERMAL STRUCTURE; LAGO MAGGIORE; PHYTOPLANKTON; VARIABILITY; SIMULATION; STRATIFICATION; IMPACT; DYRESM",NA,"SPRINGER","NEW YORK","ONE NEW YORK PLAZA, SUITE 4600, NEW YORK, NY, UNITED STATES","0930-7575","1432-0894",NA,"CLIM DYNAM","Clim.

More frequent thaws have resulted in that snowmelt runoff formation can be seen almost throughout winter. A decrease in soil moisture content in the late October along with a decrease in the maximal freezing depth in the major portion of the basin increases water losses during thaws and at the early stages of spring flood.

FALSE,84,"Comparison of Deterministic and Statistical Models for Water Quality Compliance Forecasting in the San Joaquin River Basin, California","Model selection for water quality forecasting depends on many factors including analyst expertise and cost, stakeholder involvement and expected performance. Water quality forecasting in arid river basins is especially challenging given the importance of protecting beneficial uses in these environments and the livelihood of agricultural communities. In the agriculture-dominated San Joaquin River Basin of California, real-time salinity management (RTSM) is a state-sanctioned program that helps to maximize allowable salt export while protecting existing basin beneficial uses of water supply. The RTSM strategy supplants the federal total maximum daily load (TMDL) approach that could impose fines associated with exceedances of monthly and annual salt load allocations of up to $1 million per year based on average year hydrology and salt load export limits. The essential components of the current program include the establishment of telemetered sensor networks, a web-based information system for sharing data, a basin-scale salt load assimilative capacity forecasting model and institutional entities tasked with performing weekly forecasts of river salt assimilative capacity and scheduling west-side drainage export of salt loads. Web-based information portals have been developed to share model input data and salt assimilative capacity forecasts together with increasing stakeholder awareness and involvement in water quality resource management activities in the river basin. Two modeling approaches have been developed simultaneously. The first relies on a statistical analysis of the relationship between flow and salt concentration at three compliance monitoring sites and the use of these regression relationships for forecasting. The second salt load forecasting approach is a customized application of the Watershed Analysis Risk Management Framework (WARMF), a watershed water quality simulation model that has been configured to estimate daily river salt assimilative capacity and to provide decision support for real-time salinity management at the watershed level. Analysis of the results from both model-based forecasting approaches over a period of five years shows that the regression-based forecasting model, run daily Monday to Friday each week, provided marginally better performance. However, the regression-based forecasting model assumes the same general relationship between flow and salinity which breaks down during extreme weather events such as droughts when water allocation cutbacks among stakeholders are not evenly distributed across the basin. A recent test case shows the utility of both models in dealing with an exceedance event at one compliance monitoring site recently introduced in 2020.","https://doi.org/10.3390/w13192661","10.3390/w13192661","Quinn, Nigel W.

Largemouth bass were projected to experience enhanced or slightly reduced habitat during all seasons, and throughout the mid-21st century. By contrast, walleye habitat was projected to decline with anticipated warming, except during the spring in the smaller of our two study reservoirs and during the fall in the larger of our two study reservoirs. Saugeye habitat was projected to either increase modestly or decline slightly during the spring and fall and declines in habitat quality and quantity that were smaller than those for walleye were identified during summer. Collectively, our findings indicate that climate warming will differentially alter habitat suitability for reservoir piscivores, favouring warm-water species over cool-water species. We expect these changes in habitat quality to impact the dynamics of reservoir fish populations to varying degrees necessitating the consideration of climate when making future management decisions.","https://doi.org/10.1111/eff.12561","10.1111/eff.12561","Budnik, Richard R.; Conroy, Joseph D.; Zweifel, Richard D.; Ludsin, Stuart A.; Marschall, Elizabeth A.","ECOLOGY OF FRESHWATER FISH","climate change; growth rate potential; habitat quality; largemouth bass; reservoirs; Sander spp","MENHADEN BREVOORTIA-TYRANNUS; WALLEYE SANDER-VITREUS; CLIMATE-CHANGE; SMALLMOUTH BASS; BIOENERGETICS MODELS; PREY AVAILABILITY; POTENTIAL IMPACTS; CALORIC DENSITIES; LARGEMOUTH BASS; YELLOW PERCH",NA,"WILEY","HOBOKEN","111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA","0906-6691","1600-0633",NA,"ECOL FRESHW FISH","Ecol.

As an important source of drinking water in North China, its water quality safety determines the success or failure of a sizable water supply. At present, there is a lack of in-depth and systematic understanding of the interaction between hydrodynamics and the water environment as well as water ecological processes in the main canal at the early stages of operation. It is not currently possible to accurately predict water quality and algae status at the early stage of canal ecosystem succession. Change trends and distribution characteristics of the main water ecological environment elements in the main canal at the early MR stage are analyzed in this study. The main factors influencing algae are investigated by principal component analysis (PCA) to characterize the water quality and algae transport distribution in the main MR canal under the complex multi-sluice joint dispatching conditions. The relationship between environmental factors, hydrodynamic, water quality, and algae in the coupled canal-sluice system in the SNWDP MR is determined. Algae distributions under different water transmission conditions in a typical canal section are predicted accordingly. CODMn and algal density in the main canal are shown to increase from south to north along the canal. DO decreases from south to north; other water quality indexes do not significantly differ from north to south. Algal density along the canal differs to the greatest extent in summer, followed by spring and autumn, and is the weakest in winter. The predicted algae densities in the main canal under different water conveying conditions show that single sluice control and strong water flow from Taocha Head Section increase the flow velocity after passing through the sluice with a fixed opening. Algal density decreases flow rate increases under single sluice regulation conditions. The maximum rate of algal density change reaches 22.13% and 29.55% under double sluice and four sluice scheduling. Algae control effects grow significantly as the number of control sluices increases.

Several French institutions have been collaborating over the last years to develop an operational tool for low-flow forecasting, called PREMHYCE. It was tested in real time on more than one hundred catchments in continental France since 2017. PREMHYCE includes five hydrological models, which are calibrated on gauged catchments and which assimilate flow observations. Low-flow forecasts can be issued up to 90 days ahead, based on Ensemble Streamflow Prediction (ESP) using historical climatic data as ensembles of future input scenarios. The performance of the forecasting tool is analysed on the 2017-2018 low flows on 38 catchments for which forecasts are available for all the models. The capacity to anticipate low-flow events shows an average anticipation of 40 days. The short-term forecast (7 days ahead) is good for most of the models.","https://doi.org/10.1051/lhb/2020043","10.1051/lhb/2020043","Tilmant, Francois; Nicolle, Pierre; Bourgin, Francois; Besson, Francois; Delaigue, Olivier; Etchevers, Pierre; Francois, Didier; Le Lay, Matthieu; Perrin, Charles; Rousset, Fabienne; Thiery, Dominique; Magand, Claire; Leurent, Timothee; Jacob, Elise","HOUILLE BLANCHE-REVUE INTERNATIONALE DE L EAU","low-flow forecasts; hydrological model; ensemble forecasting; water resources management; drought","POTENTIAL EVAPOTRANSPIRATION MODEL; HYDROLOGICAL MODELS; RIVER; SENSITIVITY; SIMULATION; FRANCE",NA,"EDP SCIENCES S A","LES ULIS CEDEX A","17, AVE DU HOGGAR, PA COURTABOEUF, BP 112, F-91944 LES ULIS CEDEX A, FRANCE","0018-6368","1958-5551",NA,"HOUILLE BLANCHE","Houille Blanche-Rev.

FALSE,88,"Individual-based models forecast the spread and inform the management of an emerging riverine invader","Aim Mounting ecological impacts of invasive species on freshwater ecosystems are among the greatest challenges confronting ecologists and decision-makers in conserving biodiversity and ecosystem function. Tools to slow the proliferation of aquatic invasive species are still needed to guide the allocation of limited resources more effectively and efficiently once a species is already established. Here we develop mechanistic models to recreate the invasion history of the rusty crayfish Faxonius rusticus in the John Day River (JDR) basin, forecast its future distribution, and evaluate the management efficiency of, and trade-offs among, population control actions. Location Methods John Day River Basin, Oregon. The spread and control of rusty crayfish in the JDR was simulated with a spatially explicit individual-based model (SEIBM) whereby the life history of each crayfish in the population is modelled in response to environmental conditions that vary across space and time. The model was calibrated by comparing modelled rusty crayfish spread throughout the JDR to known occurrences according to three comprehensive surveys. Results Main conclusion Our model accurately reproduced historical rusty crayfish distribution data for 2005, 2010, and 2016 with a specificity and sensitivity of similar to 80%. Leveraging this realistic model of the spread of rusty crayfish, we show that rapid management actions to the initial invasion would have resulted in an opportunity to slow the spread of rusty crayfish. We instead predict that rusty crayfish will reach the mainstem of the Columbia River by 2025, at which our model predicts that the crayfish population will number on the order of 10(8) individuals over more than 1100 km of river throughout the watershed and progress into critical salmon spawning habitat. This study demonstrates that SEIBMs can provide unique insight into the future distribution of aquatic invasive species and concretely support decision-makers in choosing an optimal control strategy.","https://doi.org/10.1111/ddi.12829","10.1111/ddi.12829","Messager, Mathis L.; Olden, Julian D.","DIVERSITY AND DISTRIBUTIONS","aquatic invasive species; crayfish; individual-based model; invasive species management; John Day River; secondary spread","CRAYFISH PROCAMBARUS-CLARKII; ORCONECTES-RUSTICUS GIRARD; JOHN DAY RIVER; PACIFASTACUS-LENIUSCULUS; SIGNAL CRAYFISH; POPULATION; INVASIONS; ERADICATION; PREDATION; FRAMEWORK",NA,"WILEY","HOBOKEN","111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA","1366-9516","1472-4642",NA,"DIVERS DISTRIB","Divers.

FALSE,89,"Projected Hydroclimatic Changes in Two Major River Basins at the Canadian West Coast Based on High-Resolution Regional Climate Simulations","The impact of anthropogenic climate change on water resources and flood and drought risk is of great interest for impact modeling and to inform adaptation strategies. Here an analysis of hydroclimatic changes in the Fraser and Athabasca River basins in western Canada is presented, based on an ensemble of climate projections, which have been dynamically downscaled to 10-km resolution using the Weather Research and Forecasting Model in two configurations. The GCM ensemble comprises four independent integrations of the Community Earth System Model under the representative concentration pathway 8.5. Basin-integrated changes in the seasonal cycle of hydroclimatic variables, and the variability of water supply and flood and drought risk, are considered. It is found that fall and winter precipitation generally increase by 20%-30% toward the end of the century, while changes in summer precipitation are smaller and associated with high model uncertainty. Furthermore, a reduction in snowfall and an increase in evapotranspiration are projected. However, projected impacts on water resources east and west of the Rocky Mountains are quite different: in basins closer to the coast (west of the Rocky Mountains) higher temperatures lead to a transition from predominantly solid to liquid precipitation and a significantly weaker spring freshet, followed by drier summers. In the lee of the Rocky Mountains the spring freshet remains largely unaffected and in summer the increase in evapotranspiration (ET) is compensated by increasing precipitation, so that water balance changes appear to be small. It is further found that a shift in runoff seasonality near the coast may lead to significantly increased flood risk in fall.","https://doi.org/10.1175/JCLI-D-16-0870.1","10.1175/JCLI-D-16-0870.1","Erler, Andre R.; Peltier, W.

FALSE,90,"Assessment and projection of the water budget over western Canada using convection-permitting weather research and forecasting simulations","Water resources in cold regions in western Canada face severe risks posed by anthropogenic global warming as evapotranspiration increases and precipitation regimes shift. Although understanding the water cycle is key for addressing climate change issues, it is difficult to obtain high spatial- and temporal-resolution observations of hydroclimatic processes, especially in remote regions. Climate models are useful tools for dissecting and diagnosing these processes, especially the convection-permitting (CP) high-resolution regional climate simulation, which provides advantages over lower-resolution models by explicitly representing convection. In addition to better representing convective systems, higher spatial resolution also better represents topography, mountain meteorology, and highly heterogeneous geophysical features. However, there is little work with convection-permitting regional climate models conducted over western Canada. Focusing on the Mackenzie River and Saskatchewan River basins, this study investigated the surface water budget and atmospheric moisture balance in historical and representative concentration pathway (RCP8.5) projections using 4 km CP Weather Research and Forecasting (WRF). We compared the high-resolution 4 km CP WRF and three common reanalysis datasets, namely the North American Regional Reanalysis (NARR), the Japanese 55-year Reanalysis (JRA-55), and European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts reanalysis interim dataset (ERA-Interim). High-resolution WRF outperforms the reanalyses in balancing the surface water budget in both river basins with much lower residual terms. For the pseudo-global-warming scenario at the end of the 21st century with representative concentration pathway (RCP8.5) radiative forcing, both the Mackenzie River and Saskatchewan River basins show increases in the amplitude for precipitation and evapotranspiration and a decrease in runoff. The Saskatchewan River basin (SRB) shows a moderate increase in precipitation in the west and a small decrease in the east. Combined with a significant increase in evapotranspiration in a warmer climate, the Saskatchewan River basin would have a larger deficit of water resources than in the current climate based on the pseudo-global-warming (PGW) simulation. The high-resolution simulation also shows that the difference of atmospheric water vapour balance in the two river basins is due to flow orientation and topography differences at the western boundaries of the two basins. The sensitivity of water vapour balance to fine-scale topography and atmospheric processes shown in this study demonstrates that high-resolution dynamical downscaling is important for large-scale water balance and hydrological cycles.","https://doi.org/10.5194/hess-24-3677-2020","10.5194/hess-24-3677-2020","Kurkute, Sopan; Li, Zhenhua; Li, Yanping; Huo, Fei","HYDROLOGY AND EARTH SYSTEM SCIENCES",NA,"CLIMATE-CHANGE; ECMWF MODEL; ERA-INTERIM; LAND; PARAMETERIZATION; IMPLEMENTATION; REPRESENTATION; PRECIPITATION; HYDROLOGY; STORAGE",NA,"COPERNICUS GESELLSCHAFT MBH","GOTTINGEN","BAHNHOFSALLEE 1E, GOTTINGEN, 37081, GERMANY","1027-5606","1607-7938",NA,"HYDROL EARTH SYST SC","Hydrol.

Up to now, forecast products focus on atmospheric variables, such as precipitation, air temperature and, in hydrology, on river discharge. Considering the full terrestrial system from groundwater across the land surface into the atmosphere, a number of important hydrologic variables are missing especially with regard to the shallow and deeper subsurface (e.g., groundwater), which are gaining considerable attention in the context of global change. In this study, we propose a terrestrial monitoring/forecasting system using the Terrestrial Systems Modeling Platform (TSMP) that predicts all essential states and fluxes of the terrestrial hydrologic and energy cycles from groundwater into the atmosphere. Closure of the terrestrial cycles provides a physically consistent picture of the terrestrial system in TSMP. TSMP has been implemented over a regional domain over North Rhine-Westphalia and a continental domain over Europe in a real-time forecast/monitoring workflow. Applying a real-time forecasting/monitoring workflow over both domains, experimental forecasts are being produced with different lead times since the beginning of 2016. Real-time forecast/monitoring products encompass all compartments of the terrestrial system including additional hydrologic variables, such as plant available soil water, groundwater table depth, and groundwater recharge and storage.","https://doi.org/10.3390/w10111697","10.3390/w10111697","Kollet, Stefan; Gasper, Fabian; Brdar, Slavko; Goergen, Klaus; Hendricks-Franssen, Harrie-Jan; Keune, Jessica; Kurtz, Wolfgang; Kuell, Volker; Pappenberger, Florian; Poll, Stefan; Troemel, Silke; Shrestha, Prabhakar; Simmer, Clemens; Sulis, Mauro","WATER","terrestrial modeling; real-time forecasting/monitoring; workflows","RAINFALL MEASUREMENT; WEATHER PREDICTION; FORECAST SYSTEM; GROUNDWATER; PARALLEL; ATTENUATION; COSMO",NA,"MDPI","BASEL","ST ALBAN-ANLAGE 66, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND","2073-4441",NA,NA,"WATER-SUI","Water","NOV",2018,"10","11",NA,NA,"1697",NA

In order to improve the prediction accuracy, this paper establishes a multivariate and multistage streamflow prediction model based on the combination of mode decomposition and deep learning models, including the variational mode decomposition (VMD), improved complete ensemble empirical mode decomposition with adaptive noise (ICEEMD), convolutional neural network (CNN), and long short-term memory (LSTM). Taking the Wei River Basin (WRB) of China as an example, streamflow in six hydrometric stations from the main stream of the WRB is used to validate the model. The results show that the proposed model have good prediction skills, and the prediction results of multistage models are better than single-stage models; however, the most complex models do not have the best results. The VMD also preformed better prediction skills than ICEEMD, and the optimal model was VCL (VMD-CNN-LSTM). The root-mean-square error, peak percentage of threshold statistic, and Nash-Sutcliffe efficiency coefficient of VCL at Huaxian station are 43.82 m3/s, 10.02%, and 0.94, respectively.

This study proposed a simple yet efficient approach, the Bivar_update model that utilizes bivariate climate forecast to update individual probabilities of the ensemble streamflow prediction. The Bayesian updating scheme is used to update the joint probability mass function derived from historic precipitation and temperature data sets. Thirty-five dam basins were used for the case study, and the modified Tank model was embedded into the ensemble streamflow prediction framework. The performance of the proposed approach was evaluated through a comparison with a reference streamflow forecast model, the Univar_update model, that reflects only precipitation forecast, in terms of deterministic and categorical streamflow forecast accuracy. For this purpose, multiple cases of probabilistic precipitation and temperature forecasts were synthetically generated. As a result, the Bivar_update model was able to decrease the errors in forecast under below-normal conditions. The improvements in forecasting skills were found for both measures; deterministic and categorical streamflow forecasts. Since the proposed Bivar_update model reflects both precipitation and temperature information, it can compensate low predictability especially under dry conditions in which the streamflow's dependency on temperature increases.","https://doi.org/10.3390/su12072905","10.3390/su12072905","Sung, Jang Hyun; Ryu, Young; Seo, Seung Beom","SUSTAINABILITY","probabilistic forecast; Bayesian update; Croley-Wilks; joint probability mass function; ensemble streamflow prediction","PRECIPITATION; TEMPERATURE; IMPACTS; WEATHER; MODEL; OPTIMIZATION; SIMULATIONS; DROUGHT; KOREA",NA,"MDPI","BASEL","ST ALBAN-ANLAGE 66, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND",NA,"2071-1050",NA,"SUSTAINABILITY-BASEL","Sustainability","APR",2020,"12","7",NA,NA,"2905",NA
FALSE,95,"Trophic state indicators are a better predictor of Florida bass condition compared to temperature in Florida's freshwater bodies","Forecasted increases in global temperatures will likely have profound effects on freshwater fishes. Overlaid on increasing global temperatures, human populations are expected to grow, which will increase anthropogenic nutrient enrichment in freshwater ecosystems. Florida (US) represents the equatorial range limit for many freshwater fishes, thus these species are potentially at risk to climate warming. Likewise, Florida's population is expected to aggressively expand, increasing risk for nutrient enrichment. In this study, we examined whether maximum water temperatures or trophic state indicators (a proxy for nutrient enrichment) better explains variation in Florida Bass (Micropterus salmoides floridanus) condition across 23 different Florida freshwater bodies distributed throughout the state. Florida Bass lengths and weights, temperature, and chlorophyll-alpha, total phosphorous (TP), and total nitrogen (TN) measures were collected in the late summer and fall from 2010 to 2012. We described relationships between bass relative condition and environmental measurements (temperature, and trophic state indicators) across these lake-year combinations using linear and non-linear regressions. We found no significant relationship between temperature and bass condition (r(2) = 0.01). However, we found that trophic state indicators did predict bass condition (r(2) = 0.39-0.50). Though research is needed to more rigorously assess the effects of rising temperature on bass condition, our results may suggest that lake productivity is currently an influential driver on Florida Bass. As such, management efforts should continue to closely monitor and manage water quality and potential nutrient enrichment in Florida's freshwater waters, as bass condition appears to be closely tied to lake productivity.","https://doi.org/10.1007/s10641-017-0635-9","10.1007/s10641-017-0635-9","Boucek, Ross; Barrientos, Christian; Bush, Michael R.; Gandy, David A.; Wilson, Kyle L.; Young, Joy M.","ENVIRONMENTAL BIOLOGY OF FISHES","Florida bass; Lake productivity; Florida; Condition","LARGEMOUTH BASS; CLIMATE-CHANGE; MICROPTERUS-SALMOIDES; OXYGEN LIMITATION; THERMAL TOLERANCE; BODY CONDITION; FISH; LAKE; PRODUCTIVITY; NORTHERN",NA,"SPRINGER","NEW YORK","233 SPRING ST, NEW YORK, NY 10013 USA","0378-1909","1573-5133",NA,"ENVIRON BIOL FISH","Environ.

FALSE,97,"The Value of Long-Term Streamflow Forecasts in Adaptive Reservoir Operation: The Case of the High Aswan Dam in the Transboundary Nile River Basin","Transboundary river basins are experiencing extensive dam development that challenges future water management, especially for downstream nations. Thus, adapting the operation of existing reservoirs is indispensable to cope with alterations in flow regime. We proposed a Forecast-Based Adaptive Reservoir Operation (FARO) framework to evaluate the use of long-term climate forecasts in improving real-time reservoir operations. The FARO approach was applied to the High Aswan Dam (HAD) in the Nile River basin. Monthly precipitation and temperature forecasts at up to 12 months of lead time are used from a suite of eight North American Multi-Model Ensemble (NMME) models. The value of NMME-based forecasts to reservoir operations was compared with perfect and climatology-based forecasts over an optimization horizon of 10 years from 1993 to 2002. Our results indicated that the forecast horizon for HAD operation ranges between 5 and 12 months lead time at low- and high-demand scenarios, respectively, beyond which the forecast information no longer improves the release decision. The forecast value to HAD operation is more pronounced in the months following the flooding season (October-December). During these months, the skill of streamflow forecasts using NMME forcings outperforms the climatology-based forecasts. When considering the operation of upstream Grand Ethiopian Renaissance Dam (GERD), using streamflow forecasts minimally helps to maintain current target objectives of HAD operation and therefore result in higher operation costs as opposed to current conditions without GERD. Our study underlined the importance of deriving a new adaptive operating policy for HAD to improve the value of available forecasts while considering GERD filling and operation phases. SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT Water management in the Nile River basin is challenged by the construction of the Grand Ethiopian Renaissance Dam (GERD) in Ethiopia. Thus, it becomes important to adapt the operation of existing dams to expected alteration in upstream flow. This study aims to use long-term forecasts to improve real-time operations of the High Aswan Dam (HAD) in Egypt. Forecasting streamflow up to 8 months ahead showed a significant improvement in the HAD operation. However, when considering GERD, using forecasts could minimally help to maintain current objectives of HAD operation. Our findings underline the importance of deriving a new operating policy for HAD to improve the value of available forecasts while considering future upstream projects.","https://doi.org/10.1175/JHM-D-20-0241.1","10.1175/JHM-D-20-0241.1","Eldardiry, Hisham; Hossain, Faisal","JOURNAL OF HYDROMETEOROLOGY","Rivers; Forecast verification; skill; Operational forecasting; Seasonal forecasting; Hydrologic models; Optimization","BLUE-NILE; WATER-RESOURCES; MODEL; SYSTEMS; RULES; LEAD; PREDICTABILITY; UNCERTAINTY; PREDICTION; RAINFALL",NA,"AMER METEOROLOGICAL SOC","BOSTON","45 BEACON ST, BOSTON, MA 02108-3693 USA","1525-755X","1525-7541",NA,"J HYDROMETEOROL","J.

Results from both cross validation and split sampling reveal that in general, the probabilistic categorical forecasts from the MLR model have more accuracy and exhibit higher rank probability skill score (RPSS) compared to the PCR probabilistic forecasts. MLR forecasts are also more skillful than PCR forecasts during the winter season as well as for basins that exhibit high interannual variability in streamflows. The role of ensemble size of precipitation forecasts in developing MLR-based streamflow forecasts was also investigated.

The time scale of subseasonal forecasting (from 2 weeks to 1 month) is a critical lead time for proactive mitigation of flood disasters. The NOAA Climate Testbed Subseasonal Experiment (SubX) is a research-to-operations project with almost immediate availability of forecasts. It has produced a reforecast database that facilitates evaluation of flood forecasts at these subseasonal lead times. Here, we examine the SubX-driven forecast skill of AR-related flooding out to 4-week lead using the Distributed Hydrology Soil Vegetation Model (DHSVM), with particular attention to the role of antecedent soil moisture (ASM), which modulates the relationship between meteorological and hydrological forecast skill. We study three watersheds along a transect of the U.S. West Coast: the Chehalis River basin in Washington, the Russian River basin in Northern California, and the Santa Margarita River basin in Southern California. We find that the SubX-driven flood forecast skill drops quickly after week 1, during which there is relatively high deterministic forecast skill. We find some probabilistic forecast skill relative to climatology as well as ensemble streamflow prediction (ESP) in week 2, but minimal skill in weeks 3-4, especially for annual maximum floods, notwithstanding some probabilistic skill for smaller floods in week 3. Using ESP and reverse-ESP experiments to consider the relative influence of ASM and SubX reforecast skill, we find that ASM dominates probabilistic forecast skill only for small flood events at week 1, while SubX reforecast skill dominates for large flood events at all lead times.","https://doi.org/10.1175/JHM-D-20-0219.1","10.1175/JHM-D-20-0219.1","Cao, Qian; Shukla, Shraddhanand; DeFlorio, Michael J.; Ralph, F.

Our forecast strategy was based on pairing two machine learning models with a long-term database built over the past 34 years. We created HAB groups via a K-means model. Then, we introduced different lag times in the input of a random forest (RF) model, using a sliding window. Finally, we used a high-frequency dataset to compare the natural mechanisms with numerical interaction using individual conditional expectation plots. We demonstrate that some HAB events can be forecasted over a year scale. The information contained in the concentration data of the cyanobacteria was synthesized in the form of four intensity groups that directly depend on the P. rubescens concentration. The categorical transformation of these data allowed us to obtain a forecast with correlation coefficients that stayed above a threshold of 0.5 until one year for the counting cells and two years for the biovolume data. Moreover, we found that the RF model predicted the best P. rubescens abundance for water temperatures around 14 degrees C. This result is consistent with the biological processes of the toxic cyano-bacterium. In this study, we found that the coupling between K-means and RF models could help in forecasting the development of the bloom-forming P. rubescens in Lake Geneva. This methodology could create a numerical decision support tool, which should be a significant advantage for lake managers.","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.hal.2020.101906","10.1016/j.hal.2020.101906","Derot, Jonathan; Yajima, Hiroshi; Jacquet, Stephan","HARMFUL ALGAE","Water quality management; Planktothrix rubescens; Peri-alpine lakes; Forecast; Random forest; Individual conditional expectation plots","CHLOROPHYLL-A; FRESH-WATER; CYANOBACTERIAL TOXINS; MANAGEMENT; HEALTH; FISH; PERFORMANCE; QUALITY; IMPACT; GROWTH",NA,"ELSEVIER","AMSTERDAM","RADARWEG 29, 1043 NX AMSTERDAM, NETHERLANDS","1568-9883","1878-1470",NA,"HARMFUL ALGAE","Harmful Algae","NOV",2020,"99",NA,NA,NA,"101906",NA
FALSE,219,"Skilful seasonal forecasts of streamflow over Europe?","This paper considers whether there is any added value in using seasonal climate forecasts instead of historical meteorological observations for forecasting streamflow on seasonal timescales over Europe. A Europe-wide analysis of the skill of the newly operational EFAS (European Flood Awareness System) seasonal streamflow forecasts (produced by forcing the Lisflood model with the ECMWF System 4 seasonal climate forecasts), benchmarked against the ensemble streamflow prediction (ESP) forecasting approach (produced by forcing the Lisflood model with historical meteorological observations), is undertaken. The results suggest that, on average, the System 4 seasonal climate forecasts improve the streamflow predictability over historical meteorological observations for the first month of lead time only (in terms of hindcast accuracy, sharpness and overall performance). However, the predictability varies in space and time and is greater in winter and autumn. Parts of Europe additionally exhibit a longer predictability, up to 7 months of lead time, for certain months within a season. In terms of hindcast reliability, the EFAS seasonal streamflow hindcasts are on average less skilful than the ESP for all lead times. The results also highlight the potential usefulness of the EFAS seasonal streamflow forecasts for decision-making (measured in terms of the hindcast discrimination for the lower and upper terciles of the simulated streamflow). Although the ESP is the most potentially useful forecasting approach in Europe, the EFAS seasonal streamflow forecasts appear more potentially useful than the ESP in some regions and for certain seasons, especially in winter for almost 40 % of Europe. Patterns in the EFAS seasonal streamflow hindcast skill are however not mirrored in the System 4 seasonal climate hindcasts, hinting at the need for a better understanding of the link between hydrological and meteorological variables on seasonal timescales, with the aim of improving climate-model-based seasonal streamflow forecasting.","https://doi.org/10.5194/hess-22-2057-2018","10.5194/hess-22-2057-2018","Arnal, Louise; Cloke, Hannah L.; Stephens, Elisabeth; Wetterhall, Fredrik; Prudhomme, Christel; Neumann, Jessica; Krzeminski, Blazej; Pappenberger, Florian","HYDROLOGY AND EARTH SYSTEM SCIENCES",NA,"PROBABILISTIC FORECASTS; CLIMATE FORECASTS; WATER-RESOURCES; UNITED-STATES; SYSTEM; RIVER; PREDICTABILITY; DROUGHT; MODEL; TIME",NA,"COPERNICUS GESELLSCHAFT MBH","GOTTINGEN","BAHNHOFSALLEE 1E, GOTTINGEN, 37081, GERMANY","1027-5606","1607-7938",NA,"HYDROL EARTH SYST SC","Hydrol.

FALSE,220,"Evaluation and prediction of water quality in the dammed estuaries and rivers of Taihu Lake","Proper evaluation of water quality is pertinent to estuarine habitat restoration. Identifying the degrading factors of the water environment and predicting the trend of eutrophication are key to restore the habitat. Through trophic level index (TLI), water quality index (WQI), modified Nemerow pollution index (NPI), and the Random Forest (RF) model, water samples collected from various estuaries of Taihu Lake from 2017 to 2019 were evaluated. To predict the water quality development, four scenarios were set viz. S1: add or remove an ecological buffer, S2: increase or reduce the external nutrients, S3: open or close the dam/gate, and S4: increase or decrease the internal release. In Wuli Lake, the nutrient concentrations in the river regions were higher than in the lake regions, while a contrary trend was observed in Gonghu Bay. The estuarine water quality in the dry season (WQI = 40.91, NPI = 1.73) was merely worse than that in the wet season (WQI = 47.27, NPI = 1.67). On the other hand, the eutrophic status in the wet season (TLIWet = 57.93) was worse than that in the dry season (TLIDry = 57.23). The estuarine water quality of Taihu Lake has improved from 2017 to 2019 but still belongs to medium level. The principal component analysis (PCA) revealed that dam construction, land use types, unstable hydrodynamic conditions, and trumpet-shaped estuary were the main factors that aggravated the water quality degradation. The RF model has strong forecasting capabilities for estuarine water quality. When the estuaries are close to residential and industrial districts, controlling the surface runoff and improving sewage treatment efficiency are the most effective measures to improve the water quality. In the estuaries, the sediments are usually disturbed by the wind-waves. Conclusively, reducing sediment disturbance and internal contamination accumulation via biological and engineering measures is the key to estuarine restoration.","https://doi.org/10.1007/s11356-020-12063-6","10.1007/s11356-020-12063-6","Chen, Xi; Wang, Yanhua; Sun, Tian; Chen, Yan; Zhang, Maoheng; Ye, Chun","ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE AND POLLUTION RESEARCH","Taihu Lake; Estuary; Water quality evaluation; Prediction; Random forest","NONPOINT-SOURCE POLLUTION; EUTROPHICATION; IMPACT; INDEXES; SYSTEM; BASIN; STOICHIOMETRY; LIMITATION; SEDIMENT; NITROGEN",NA,"SPRINGER HEIDELBERG","HEIDELBERG","TIERGARTENSTRASSE 17, D-69121 HEIDELBERG, GERMANY","0944-1344","1614-7499",NA,"ENVIRON SCI POLLUT R","Environ.

This study covered three of the most representative rivers of the Shu basin. It was based on the weather and gauging stations' observation data in the river Shu basin - the northern Tien Shan. Based on the trend analysis, an increase in the average annual temperature and river discharge was identified within the observation period as a whole, and for the separate compared periods. Furthermore, the mean annual flow projections were made based on the methodology of the retrospective analysis of runoff and the rate of river flow increase for the observation period, and further extrapolation of data for the forecast period. According to the analysis, the mean annual flow for the considered rivers will be decreased by 25 to 30% on average by 2050.

FALSE,222,"Hazardous chemical accident prediction for drinking water sources in Three Gorges Reservoir","Water pollution accidents occur in drinking water sources may pollute water environment, destroy water ecological balance, and threaten the drinking water safety for residents. Based on water quality hydrodynamic mathematical equations and Digital Elevation Model, a new water pollution accident prediction program for drinking water sources in Three Gorges Reservoir under different hydrological conditions was developed. Moreover, this new program was firstly used to forecast and analyze flow field changes and concentration reduction of a hazardous chemical pollution accident in Huangjuedu drinking water source. By comparing the calculated values and the measured ones of February 10 to February 19, 2016, the maximum relative error was less than 10%, which indicated that the new program was feasible and reasonable. For pollution accident prediction in the drinking water source, the results showed that the maximum transverse velocity had stabilized as 2.070 m/s, 2.411 m/s and 2.717 m/s since 20 min after the accident responding to discharge flow of Xiangjiaba with 1800 m3/s, 2700 m3/s,and 3600 m3/s, respectively. The maximum vertical one was 1.372 m/s, 1.598 m/s and 1.872 m/s respectively since 20 min after accident under the corresponding conditions. Furthermore, the water quality of the drinking water source met the standard 23 min after the accident under the condition that the discharge flow of Xiangjiaba was 1800 m3/s. For conditions that discharge flows were 2700 m3/s and 3600 m3/s, the corresponding times to meet the standard were 21 min and 20 min after the accident, respectively. Thence, relatively large dispatch flows would help reduce the impacts of pollution accidents and accelerate water quality improvement of drinking water sources. This study provides a new and useful tool for predicting the diffusion and migration of pollutants in drinking water sources of Three Gorges Reservoir. And it also gives a practical reference for decision makers to forcast hazardous chemical pollution accidents in drinking water sources. (c) 2021 Elsevier Ltd.

FALSE,224,"Long lead-time daily and monthly streamflow forecasting using machine learning methods","Long lead-time streamflow forecasting is of great significance for water resources planning and management in both the short and long terms. Despite of some studies using machine learning methods in streamflow forecasting, only few studies have been conducted to explore long lead-time forecasting capabilities of these methods, and gain an insight into systematic comparison of model forecasting performance in both the short and long terms. In this work, an artificial neural network (ANN) and a long short term memory (LSTM), a powerful tool for learning long-term temporal dependencies and capturing nonlinear relationship, have been adopted to forecast streamflow at daily and monthly scales for a long lead-time period. For long lead-time streamflow forecasting, a recursive forecasting procedure, which takes the last one-step-ahead forecast as a new input for the next-step-ahead forecast, is used in the ANN and LSTM forecasting systems. Two models are trained and validated for streamflow forecasting using the rainfall and runoff datasets collected from the Nan River Basin and Ping River Basin, Thailand, covering the period 1974 to 2014. To further explore the impact of parameter settings on model performance, two parameters, i.e. the length of time lag and the number of maximum epochs, are examined in the ANN and LSTM models. The main findings are highlighted here. First, with an optimal setting up of model parameters, both the ANN and LSTM model can provide accurate daily forecasting (up to 20 days ahead). Second, in comparison to the ANN model, the LSTM model exhibits better model performance in long lead-time daily forecasting, but less satisfactory in multi-monthly forecasting due to lack of large monthly training dataset. Third, the selection of the length of the time lag and number of maximum epochs used in both ANN and LSTM modelling are the key for long lead-time streamflow forecasting at daily and monthly scales. These findings suggest that the LSTM could be advance in daily streamflow forecasting and thus would be helpful to assist in strategy decisions in water resource management.","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jhydrol.2020.125376","10.1016/j.jhydrol.2020.125376","Cheng, M.; Fang, F.; Kinouchi, T.; Navon, I.

FALSE,225,"Examination and comparison of binary metaheuristic wrapper-based input variable selection for local and global climate information-driven one-step monthly streamflow forecasting","The use of data-driven models to forecast streamflow has received substantial attention from scholars in recent years. However, systematic studies have not been performed to examine binary metaheuristic wrapper-based input variable selection (BMWIVS) in real-world streamflow forecasting. In this study, we explored binary metaheuristic-based shallow machine learning wrappers for one-step monthly streamflow forecasting using local weather information and global climate indices from three catchments with different hydroclimatic conditions. First, the maximal information coefficient (MIC) was employed to investigate the correlations among the forecasting target, streamflow and candidate input variables, which included both local and global climate information. Then, the BMWIVS models obtained by combining eight binary metaheuristic algorithms, five commonly used shallow machine learning algorithms, two combined filter-based input variable selection (FIVS) methods, and two forecasting methods were examined. Finally, the performance of each model was compared with the performance of typical benchmark models, including the univariate seasonal autoregressive integrated moving average model, five machine learning algorithms with no input variable selection, and five machine learning algorithms that use five different FIVS methods. The experimental results emphasized three significant findings. First, an appropriate input variable selection method should be selected in practice because several examined wrappers were inferior to the benchmark models. Second, the BMWIVS model that combined the regularized extreme learning machine method, binary gray wolf optimizer, FIVS results-based initialization method, and forecasted values averaged over multiple runs yielded the best performance in the three cases studied. Third, the correlations in terms of the MIC between the global climate indices and streamflow were lower than those between local weather information and streamflow, and the best wrapper and FIVS would select more local weather information variables than global climate index variables, which suggests that global climate information can be complementary to local weather information for one-step monthly streamflow forecasting. These findings have remarkable practical applications for forecasting monthly streamflow.","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jhydrol.2021.126152","10.1016/j.jhydrol.2021.126152","Ren, Kun; Wang, Xue; Shi, Xiaoyu; Qu, Jihong; Fang, Wei","JOURNAL OF HYDROLOGY","Streamflow forecasting; Input variable selection; Binary metaheuristic algorithm; Wrapper method; Machine learning","ARTIFICIAL NEURAL-NETWORKS; SUPPORT VECTOR REGRESSION; MACHINE LEARNING-METHODS; SHORT-TERM; DATA SET; MODEL; WAVELET; TIME; ALGORITHMS; PREDICTION",NA,"ELSEVIER","AMSTERDAM","RADARWEG 29, 1043 NX AMSTERDAM, NETHERLANDS","0022-1694","1879-2707",NA,"J HYDROL","J.

Most of the literature is focused on propose, compare, and evaluate the forecasting models. However, the decision on forecasting approaches plays a significant role in such models' performance. In this paper, we are focused on investigating and confront the following forecasting approaches: i) use of a single model for the whole series (annual approach) versus using 12 models, each one responsible for predicting each month (monthly approach); ii) for multistep forecasting, the use of direct and recursive methods. The forecasting models addressed are the linear Autoregressive (AR) and Periodic Autoregressive (PAR) models, from the Box & Jenkins family, and the Extreme Learning Machines (ELM), an artificial neural network architecture. The computational analysis involves 20 time series associated with hydroelectric plants indicated that the monthly approach with the direct multistep method achieved the best overall performances, except for the cases in which the coefficient of variation is higher than two. In this case, the recursive approach stood out. Also, the ELM overcame the linear models in most cases.","https://doi.org/10.2478/johh-2021-0001","10.2478/johh-2021-0001","Belotti, Jonatas; Mendes Jr, Jose Jair; Leme, Murilo; Trojan, Flavio; Stevan Jr, Sergio L.; Siqueira, Hugo","JOURNAL OF HYDROLOGY AND HYDROMECHANICS","Streamflow series prediction; Multistep forecasting; Monthly approach; Box & Jenkins models; Extreme Learning Machines","SUPPORT VECTOR REGRESSION; NEURAL-NETWORKS; UNORGANIZED MACHINES; CLASSIFICATION; PREDICTION; ALGORITHM; RIVER",NA,"SCIENDO","WARSAW","BOGUMILA ZUGA 32A, WARSAW, MAZOVIA, POLAND",NA,"1338-4333",NA,"J HYDROL HYDROMECH","J.

FALSE,304,"Quantifying and forecasting changes in the areal extent of river valley sediment in response to altered hydrology and land cover","In river valleys, sediment moves between active river channels, near-channel deposits including bars and floodplains, and upland environments such as terraces and aeolian dunefields. Sediment availability is a prerequisite for the sustained transfer of material between these areas, and for the eco-geomorphic functioning of river networks in general. However, the difficulty of monitoring sediment availability and movement at the reach or corridor scale has hindered our ability to quantify and forecast the response of sediment transfer to hydrologic or land cover alterations. Here we leverage spatiotemporally extensive datasets quantifying sediment areal coverage along a 28 km reach of the Colorado River in Grand Canyon, southwestern USA. In concert with information on hydrologic alteration and vegetation encroachment resulting from the operation of Glen Canyon Dam (constructed in 1963) upstream of our study reach, we model the relative and combined influence of changes in (a) flow and (b) riparian vegetation extent on the areal extent of sediment available for transport in the river valley over the period from 1921 to 2016. In addition, we use projections of future streamflow and vegetation encroachment to forecast sediment availability over the 20 year period from 2016 to 2036. We find that hydrologic alteration has reduced the areal extent of bare sediment by 9% from the pre- to post-dam periods, whereas vegetation encroachment further reduced bare sediment extent by 45%. Over the next 20 years, the extent of bare sediment is forecast to be reduced by an additional 12%. Our results demonstrate the impact of river regulation, specifically the loss of annual low flows and associated vegetation encroachment, on reducing the sediment available for transfer within river valleys. This work provides an extendable framework for using high-resolution data on streamflow and land cover to assess and forecast the impact of watershed perturbation (e.g. river regulation, land cover shifts, climate change) on sediment connectivity at the corridor scale.","https://doi.org/10.1177/0309133318795846","10.1177/0309133318795846","Kasprak, Alan; Sankey, Joel B.; Buscombe, Daniel; Caster, Joshua; East, Amy E.; Grams, Paul E.","PROGRESS IN PHYSICAL GEOGRAPHY-EARTH AND ENVIRONMENT","Sediment connectivity; fluvial geomorphology; aeolian geomorphology; hillslope processes; riparian vegetation","STRUCTURE-FROM-MOTION; BORDERING AEOLIAN DUNEFIELDS; GLEN CANYON DAM; COLORADO RIVER; GRAND-CANYON; RIPARIAN VEGETATION; NATIONAL-PARK; TOPOGRAPHIC SURVEYS; CONTROLLED FLOODS; BED-SEDIMENT",NA,"SAGE PUBLICATIONS LTD","LONDON","1 OLIVERS YARD, 55 CITY ROAD, LONDON EC1Y 1SP, ENGLAND","0309-1333","1477-0296",NA,"PROG PHYS GEOG","Prog.

The Niagara River transports a continental-scale flow (with an annual mean of roughly6,300 m3/s) that supports the economy of both the United States and Canada through hydropower generation, tourism, and other activities. The river also serves as a link connecting the two most downstream lakes (Lakes Erie and Ontario) in the largest system of lakes on Earth. Despite its significance, the authors know of no federally operated, short-term forecasting system for the Niagara River. Hydropower facilities management and other water resources management activities on the river have historically relied on an array of experimental, in-house, or proprietary models to simulate and forecast Niagara River flows. The study presented here fills this gap in large-scale hydraulic modeling and engineering science by calibrating a HEC-RAS model for the Upper Niagara River and customizing it to meet the operational requirements of the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) National Weather Service (NWS) Northeast River Forecasting Center (NERFC). The skill of the new forecasting system, which was recently deployed in its operational environment at the NERFC, will depend in large part on the accuracy of meteorological boundary conditions.

Therefore, many types of research are conducted to predict such events due to climate change in advance using hydrological, mathematical, and AI-based approaches. This paper presents a comparison of three major accepted AI-based approaches in flood and drought forecasting. In this study, fluvial floods are measured by the runoff change in rivers whereas meteorological droughts are measured using the Standard Precipitation Index (SPI). The performance of the Convolutional Neural Network (CNN), Long-Short Term Memory network (LSTM), and Wavelet decomposition functions combined with the Adaptive NeuroFuzzy Inference System (WANFIS) are compared in flood and drought forecasting, with five statistical performance criteria and accepted flood and drought indicators used for comparison, extending to two climatic regions: arid and tropical. The results suggest that the CNN performs best in flood forecasting with WANFIS for meteorological drought forecasting, regardless of the climate of the region under study.

With this objective, this paper proposes an analysis method for a flood forecasting and warning system, and establishes the criteria for issuing urban-stream flash flood warnings based on the amount of rainfall to allow sufficient lead time. The proposed methodology is a nonstructural approach to flood prediction and risk reduction. It considers water level fluctuations during a rainfall event and estimates the upstream (alert point) and downstream (confluence) water levels for water level analysis based on the rainfall intensity and duration. We also investigate the rainfall/runoff and flow rate/water level relationships using the Hydrologic Engineering Center's Hydrologic Modeling System (HEC-HMS) and the HEC's River Analysis System (HEC-RAS) models, respectively, and estimate the rainfall threshold for issuing flash flood warnings depending on the backwater state based on actual watershed conditions. We present a methodology for issuing flash flood warnings at a critical point by considering the effects of fluctuations in various backwater conditions in real time, which will provide practical support for decision making by disaster protection workers. The results are compared with real-time water level observations of the Dorim Stream.

FALSE,393,"Assessing the value of seasonal hydrological forecasts for improving water resource management: insights from a pilot application in the UK","Improved skill of long-range weather forecasts has motivated an increasing effort towards developing seasonal hydrological forecasting systems across Europe. Among other purposes, such forecasting systems are expected to support better water management decisions. In this paper we evaluate the potential use of a real-time optimization system (RTOS) informed by seasonal forecasts in a water supply system in the UK. For this purpose, we simulate the performances of the RTOS fed by ECMWF seasonal forecasting systems (SEAS5) over the past 10 years, and we compare them to a benchmark operation that mimics the common practices for reservoir operation in the UK. We also attempt to link the improvement of system performances, i.e. the forecast value, to the forecast skill (measured by the mean error and the continuous ranked probability skill score) as well as to the bias correction of the meteorological forcing, the decision maker priorities, the hydrological conditions and the forecast ensemble size. We find that in particular the decision maker priorities and the hydrological conditions exert a strong influence on the forecast skill-value relationship. For the (realistic) scenario where the decision maker prioritizes the water resource availability over energy cost reductions, we identify clear operational benefits from using seasonal forecasts, provided that forecast uncertainty is explicitly considered by optimizing against an ensemble of 25 equiprobable forecasts. These operational benefits are also observed when the ensemble size is reduced up to a certain limit However, when comparing the use of ECMWF-SEAS5 products to ensemble streamflow prediction (ESP), which is more easily derived from historical weather data, we find that ESP remains a hard-to-beat reference, not only in terms of skill but also in terms of value.","https://doi.org/10.5194/hess-24-6059-2020","10.5194/hess-24-6059-2020","Penuela, Andres; Hutton, Christopher; Pianosi, Francesca","HYDROLOGY AND EARTH SYSTEM SCIENCES",NA,"ENSEMBLE PREDICTION; SYSTEMS-ANALYSIS; STREAMFLOW; PERFORMANCE; SKILL; OPTIMIZATION; VERIFICATION; FUTURE; RAW",NA,"COPERNICUS GESELLSCHAFT MBH","GOTTINGEN","BAHNHOFSALLEE 1E, GOTTINGEN, 37081, GERMANY","1027-5606","1607-7938",NA,"HYDROL EARTH SYST SC","Hydrol.

FALSE,394,"Predicting Energy Generation Using Forecasting Techniques in Catalan Reservoirs","Reservoirs are natural or artificial lakes used as a source of water supply for society daily applications. In addition, hydroelectric power plants produce electricity while water flows through the reservoir. However, reservoirs are limited natural resources since water levels vary according to annual rainfalls and other natural events, and consequently, the energy generation. Therefore, forecasting techniques are helpful to predict water level, and thus, electricity production. This paper examines state-of-the-art methods to predict the water level in Catalan reservoirs comparing two approaches: using the water level uniquely, uni-variant; and adding meteorological data, multi-variant. With respect to relating works, our contribution includes a longer times series prediction keeping a high precision. The results return that combining Support Vector Machine and the multi-variant approach provides the highest precision with an R2value of 0.99.","https://doi.org/10.3390/en12101832","10.3390/en12101832","Parada, Raul; Font, Jordi; Casas-Roma, Jordi","ENERGIES","forecasting; reservoir; series analysis","FUZZY INFERENCE SYSTEM; NEURAL-NETWORKS; LEVEL FLUCTUATIONS; TIME-SERIES; VARIABLES; INFLOW; MODEL",NA,"MDPI","BASEL","ST ALBAN-ANLAGE 66, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND","1996-1073",NA,NA,"ENERGIES","Energies","MAY 2",2019,"12","10",NA,NA,"1832",NA
FALSE,395,"Forecasting Water Quality Index in Groundwater Using Artificial Neural Network","Groundwater quality monitoring in the vicinity of drilling sites is crucial for the protection of water resources. Selected physicochemical parameters of waters were marked in the study. The water was collected from 19 wells located close to a shale gas extraction site. The water quality index was determined from the obtained parameters. A secondary objective of the study was to test the capacity of the artificial neural network (ANN) methods to model the water quality index in groundwater. The number of ANN input parameters was optimized and limited to seven, which was derived using a multiple regression model. Subsequently, using the stepwise regression method, models with ever fewer variables were tested. The best parameters were obtained for a network with five input neurons (electrical conductivity, pH as well as calcium, magnesium and sodium ions), in addition to five neurons in the hidden layer. The results showed that the use of the parameters is a convenient approach to modeling water quality index with satisfactory and appropriate accuracy. Artificial neural network methods exhibited the capacity to predict water quality index at the desirable level of accuracy (RMSE = 0.651258, R = 0.9992 and R-2 = 0.9984). Neural network models can thus be used to directly predict the quality of groundwater, particularly in industrial areas. This proposed method, using advanced artificial intelligence, can aid in water treatment and management. The novelty of these studies is the use of the ANN network to forecast WQI groundwater in an area in eastern Poland that was not previously studied-in Lublin.","https://doi.org/10.3390/en14185875","10.3390/en14185875","Kulisz, Monika; Kujawska, Justyna; Przysucha, Bartosz; Cel, Wojciech","ENERGIES","artificial neural network; prediction; regressions; groundwater; water quality index","RIVER-BASIN; PREDICTION; VARIABLES; PLAIN",NA,"MDPI","BASEL","ST ALBAN-ANLAGE 66, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND",NA,"1996-1073",NA,"ENERGIES","Energies","SEP",2021,"14","18",NA,NA,"5875",NA

FALSE,398,"An overview of river flood forecasting procedures in Canadian watersheds","This paper discusses flood forecasting procedures currently practiced at the Canadian provincial river flood forecast centers. In Canada, each province is responsible for collecting and managing meteorological and hydrometric data (through provincial authorities and/or under Federal/Provincial agreements), developing suitable hydrological models, and providing information about river discharge and water level to the public. In case of an extreme event such as flood or drought, the forecast center is responsible for issuing alerts and supporting provincial emergency management. Due to the large diversity in landscape, weather, and hydrological features across the country, extreme events are triggered by different mechanisms such as snowmelt, heavy rainfall, rain on snow, etc., at different times of the year. Each river forecast center deals with unique challenges in data collection, hydrologic/hydraulic modeling, and flood forecasting. Thus, the focus of the Center in planning for developments and future directions could be significantly different from one province to another. In this paper, the significance of river flood forecasting in Canada, as well as the development in hydrological modelling procedures are highlighted. Moreover, an overview of the current approaches for streamflow/flood forecasting used by the Centers is provided. The content presented here is an outcome of our interaction with the forecast centers.

FALSE,399,"Monthly runoff time series prediction by variational mode decomposition and support vector machine based on quantum-behaved particle swarm optimization","Accurate monthly runoff prediction plays an important role in the planning and management of water resources. However, owing to climate changes and human activities, natural runoff often contains a variety of frequency components, and existing monthly runoff estimation techniques may fail to capture potential change processes effectively. To overcome this problem, we have developed a hybrid model for monthly runoff prediction. First, observed runoff is decomposed into several subcomponents via variational mode decomposition. Second, support vector machine models based on quantum-behaved particle swarm optimization are adopted to identify the input-output relationships hidden in each subcomponent. Finally, the total output of all submodules is treated as the final forecasting result for the original runoff. Three quantitative indexes are considered to test the performance of the developed models. The monthly streamflow of two reservoirs in China's Yangtze Valley is considered as the survey target. This area contains the world's largest hydropower project (Three Gorges Reservoir) and the waterhead of the middle line of Asia's largest inter-basin water transfer project (Danjiangkou Reservoir). Test results indicate that the hybrid model provides better forecasting accuracy compared to several traditional methods (artificial neural networks and extreme learning machines), making it an effective tool for the scientific operation of hydropower reservoirs.","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jhydrol.2020.124627","10.1016/j.jhydrol.2020.124627","Feng, Zhong-kai; Niu, Wen-jing; Tang, Zheng-yang; Jiang, Zhi-qiang; Xu, Yang; Liu, Yi; Zhang, Hai-rong","JOURNAL OF HYDROLOGY","Monthly runoff prediction; Decomposition and ensemble; Machine learning technique; Swarm intelligence method; Three Gorges and Danjiangkou Reservoirs","CASCADE HYDROPOWER STATIONS; MEMRISTIVE NEURAL-NETWORKS; CLIMATE-CHANGE IMPACTS; OPTIMAL OPERATION; ARTIFICIAL-INTELLIGENCE; TERM; ALGORITHM; RESERVOIR; RULES; CLASSIFICATION",NA,"ELSEVIER","AMSTERDAM","RADARWEG 29, 1043 NX AMSTERDAM, NETHERLANDS","0022-1694","1879-2707",NA,"J HYDROL","J.

FALSE,400,"Changes in river water resources of the Russian Federation's economic regions forecasted based on the CMIP5 runoff data","The article presents predictive estimates of changes in river water resources in eleven economic regions of the Russian Federation for the period of 2030 and 2050 based on the use of river runoff data of the atmospheric and ocean general circulation models (AOGCM) of the CMIP5 project. An overview of the design schemes of the AOGCM river runoff used in the research is made. The methodology uses an ensemble approach. The predictive estimates were carried out for two forecast periods 2021-2040 and 2041-2060 in relation to the period 1981-20 0 0, which was chosen as the base one. The calculations were made on the basis of an ensemble of 24 selected models for both the moderately aggressive RCP4.5 scenario and the hard RCP8.5 scenario. The results obtained were averaged over 20-year periods and compared with the corresponding values for the period 1981-20 0 0. According to the results obtained, in the coming decades there is no reason to expect any significant changes in river flow as a result of climate change. For most of the country's territory, a slight increase in annual runoff is most likely, which is within the limits of its natural variability. The most abundant river water resources will be the Asian part of the Russian Federation and the adjacent eastern part of the European territory of Russia. The most problematic from the point of view of water resources provision will be the Central Black Earth, North Caucasus and Volga economic regions. There will be more water in those regions where it is sufficient, and less where it is most needed. It should be noted that the technique presented in this article is considered by the authors primarily as one of the alternative forecasting methods that must be used in conjunction with other accepted methods. However, given the continuous process of improving the AOGCMs, as well as the quality of the information they provide, this approach should be considered as one of the most promising.

In this study, four hydrological models (WATFLOOD, HBV-EC, HSPF and HEC-HMS) were developed, calibrated and tested for their efficiency and accuracy to be used as operational flood forecasting tools. The Upper Assiniboine River, which flows into the Shellmouth Reservoir, Canada, was selected for the analysis.

The objective of this study is to model the monthly water demand in Kuwait using the nonlinear autoregressive with exogenous input (NARX) neural network approach. The country lacks conventional surface water resources and is characterized by extremely arid climate. In addition, it has one of the fastest growing populations. In this study, linear detrending is performed on the water consumption time series for the period from January 1993 to December 2018 to eliminate the influence of population growth before application to the NARX model. Monthly temperature data are selected as exogenous input to the NARX model, because they are strongly associated with the water consumption data. Correlation analyses are performed to determine the input and feedback delays of the NARX model. The results demonstrate that the recurrent NARX model is efficient and robust for forecasting the short-term water demand, with a Nash-Sutcliffe (NS) coefficient of 0.837 in the validation period. Seasonal model assessment shows that the model performs best during the critical summer season. The NARX-based recurrent model is established as a powerful and promising tool for predicting urban water demand. Thus, it can efficiently aid the development of resilient water supply plans.","https://doi.org/10.36909/jer.v9i3A.10893","10.36909/jer.v9i3A.10893","Alsumaiei, Abdullah A.","JOURNAL OF ENGINEERING RESEARCH","Water supply modeling; NARX model; Linear detrending; Water footprint; Developing countries","DEMAND; PREDICTION; RESOURCES; SCARCITY; IMPACT; MODEL; CITY; ANN",NA,"ACADEMIC PUBLICATION COUNCIL","KHALDIYA","PO BOX 17225, KHALDIYA 72453, KUWAIT","2307-1877","2307-1885",NA,"J ENG RES-KUWAIT","J.

FALSE,403,"Streamflow forecast sensitivity to air temperature forecast calibration for 139 Norwegian catchments","In this study, we used meteorological ensemble forecasts as input to hydrological models to quantify the uncertainty in forecasted streamflow, with a particular focus on the effect of temperature forecast calibration on the streamflow ensemble forecast skill. In catchments with seasonal snow cover, snowmelt is an important flood-generating process. Hence, high-quality air temperature data are important to accurately forecast streamflows. The sensitivity of streamflow ensemble forecasts to the calibration of temperature ensemble forecasts was investigated using ensemble forecasts of temperature from the European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts (ECMWF) covering a period of nearly 3 years, from 1 March 2013 to 31 December 2015. To improve the skill and reduce biases of the temperature ensembles, the Norwegian Meteorological Institute (MET Norway) provided parameters for ensemble calibration, derived using a standard quantile mapping method where HIRLAM, a high-resolution regional weather prediction model, was used as reference. A lumped HBV (Hydrologiska Byrans Vatten-balansavdelning) model, distributed on 10 elevation zones, was used to estimate the streamflow. The results show that temperature ensemble calibration affected both temperature and streamflow forecast skill, but differently depending on season and region. We found a close to 1 : 1 relationship between temperature and streamflow skill change for the spring season, whereas for autumn and winter large temperature skill improvements were not reflected in the streamflow forecasts to the same degree. This can be explained by streamflow being less affected by subzero temperature improvements, which accounted for the biggest temperature biases and corrections during autumn and winter. The skill differs between regions. In particular, there is a cold bias in the forecasted temperature during autumn and winter along the coast, enabling a large improvement by calibration. The forecast skill was partly related to elevation differences and catchment area. Overall, it is evident that temperature forecasts are important for streamflow forecasts in climates with seasonal snow cover.","https://doi.org/10.5194/hess-23-723-2019","10.5194/hess-23-723-2019","Hegdahl, Trine J.; Engeland, Kolbjorn; Steinsland, Ingelin; Tallaksen, Lena M.","HYDROLOGY AND EARTH SYSTEM SCIENCES",NA,"ENSEMBLE PREDICTION; RANK HISTOGRAMS; MODEL; ECMWF; UNCERTAINTIES; PRECIPITATION; FLOODS",NA,"COPERNICUS GESELLSCHAFT MBH","GOTTINGEN","BAHNHOFSALLEE 1E, GOTTINGEN, 37081, GERMANY","1027-5606","1607-7938",NA,"HYDROL EARTH SYST SC","Hydrol.

FALSE,404,"Streamflow drought: implication of drought definitions and its application for drought forecasting","Streamflow drought forecasting is a key element of contemporary drought early warning systems (DEWS). The term streamflow drought forecasting (not streamflow forecasting), however, has created confusion within the scientific hydrometeorological community as well as in operational weather and water management services. Streamflow drought forecasting requires an additional step, which is the application of a drought identification method to the forecasted streamflow time series. The way streamflow drought is identified is the main reason for this misperception. The purpose of this study, therefore, is to provide a comprehensive overview of the differences between different drought identification approaches to identify droughts in European rivers, including an analysis of both historical drought and implications for forecasting. Streamflow data were obtained from the LISFLOOD hydrological model forced with gridded meteorological observations (known as LISFLOOD-Simulation Forced with Observed, SFO). The same model fed with seasonal meteorological forecasts of the European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts system 5 (ECMWF SEAS 5) was used to obtain the forecasted streamflow. Streamflow droughts were analyzed using the daily and monthly variable threshold methods (VTD and VTM, respectively), the daily and monthly fixed threshold methods (FTD and FTM, respectively), and the Standardized Streamflow Index (SSI). Our results clearly show that streamflow droughts derived from different approaches deviate from each other in their characteristics, which also vary in different climate regions across Europe. The daily threshold methods (FTD and VTD) identify 25 %-50 % more drought events than the monthly threshold methods (FTM and VTM), and accordingly the average drought duration is longer for the monthly than for the daily threshold methods. The FTD and FTM, in general, identify drought occurrences earlier in the year than the VTD and VTM. In addition, the droughts obtained with the VTM and FTM approaches also have higher drought deficit volumes (about 25 %-30 %) than the VTD and FTD approaches. Overall, the characteristics of SSI-1 drought are close to what is being identified by the VTM. The different outcome obtained with the drought identification methods illustrated with the historical analysis is also found in drought forecasting, as documented for the 2003 drought across Europe and for the Rhine River specifically. In the end, there is no unique hydrological drought definition (identification method) that fits all purposes, and hence developers of DEWS and end-users should clearly agree in the co-design phase upon a sharp definition of which type of streamflow drought is required to be forecasted for a specific application.","https://doi.org/10.5194/hess-25-3991-2021","10.5194/hess-25-3991-2021","Sutanto, Samuel J.; Van Lanen, Henny A.

We presented a forecasting framework for EFs, IFA and EF satisfaction degree to assess suitable EFs (minimum or threshold) and forecast EF satisfaction degree over the next 20 years. First, we investigated the temporal and spatial distribution characteristics of IFA using statistical analysis and Morlet wavelet analysis of the hydrologic series from 1919 to 2013. Second, forecasting models of IFA were established using hydrologic stochastic simulation based on wavelet analysis. Then, abrupt shifts of baseflow index (BI) were identified based on Mann-Kendall trend detection test. Subsequently, regressions models were developed between a normalized BI and the effect size (ES) of zoobenthos and fish species richness. Accordingly, EFs were calculated. Finally, the IFA and EF satisfaction degree for the forecasting years were calculated. Results show that thresholds of BI, with 0.8 and 0.4 as the lower limit, and 2.3 and 1.1 as the upper limit, were recommended as the limit percentage of the EFs standard during flood and non-flood seasons, respectively. An overall decreasing tendency of IFA was observed in all the seven stations from the 1910s to 2010s, which is especially particularly significant in the lower reaches in the past two or three decades. One major EFs deficit spell occurred throughout the river beginning in the 1990s. Forecasting results indicate that the IFA will satisfy the EFs for the stations located in the upper and middle reaches by 2020 and 2030, except for the stations in the lower reaches. Contradictions of EFs and IFA will be even graver in the future. The results will have important implications for the water management of the riverine ecosystem. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd.

TRUE,549,"Comparison of generalized non-data-driven lake and reservoir routing models for global-scale hydrologic forecasting of reservoir outflow at diurnal time steps","Large-scale hydrologic forecasts should account for attenuation through lakes and reservoirs when flow regulation is present. Globally generalized methods for approximating outflow are required but must contend with operational complexity and a dearth of information on dam characteristics at global spatial scales. There is currently no consensus on the best approach for approximating reservoir release rates in large spatial scale hydrologic forecasting, particularly at diurnal time steps. This research compares two parsimonious reservoir routing methods at daily steps: Doll et al. (2003) and Hanasaki et al. (2006). These reservoir routing methods have been previously implemented in large-scale hydrologic modeling applications and have been typically evaluated seasonally. These routing methods are compared across 60 reservoirs operated by the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers. The authors vary empirical coefficients for both reservoir routing methods as part of a sensitivity analysis. The method proposed by Doll et al. (2003) outperformed that presented by Hanasaki et al. (2006) at a daily time step and improved model skill over most run-of-the-river conditions. The temporal resolution of the model influences model performances. The optimal model coefficients varied across the reservoirs in this study and model performance fluctuates between wet years and dry years, and for different configurations such as dams in series. Overall, the method proposed by Doll et al. (2003) could enhance large-scale hydrologic forecasting, but can be subject to instability under certain conditions.","https://doi.org/10.5194/hess-24-2711-2020","10.5194/hess-24-2711-2020","Gutenson, Joseph L.; Tavakoly, Ahmad A.; Wahl, Mark D.; Follum, Michael L.","HYDROLOGY AND EARTH SYSTEM SCIENCES",NA,"LAND-SURFACE; WATER; SYSTEM; STORAGE; IMPACT; SCHEME",NA,"COPERNICUS GESELLSCHAFT MBH","GOTTINGEN","BAHNHOFSALLEE 1E, GOTTINGEN, 37081, GERMANY","1027-5606","1607-7938",NA,"HYDROL EARTH SYST SC","Hydrol.

TRUE,550,"Decomposition-ANN Methods for Long-Term Discharge Prediction Based on Fisher's Ordered Clustering with MESA","Precise and reliable long-term streamflow prediction contributes to water resources planning and management. Artificial neural network (ANN) have shown its remarkable ability in forecasting non-linear hydrological processes without involvement of complex, dynamic, hydrological and hydro-climatologic physical process in the water shed. To improve its non-stationary responses, decomposition methods are adopted as pre-processing methods in this study including Empirical Mode Decomposition (EMD), Ensemble Empirical Mode Decomposition (EEMD) and Seasonal-Trend decomposition using Loess (STL). The original time sequence is decomposed to several components, which are then taken as the inputs of the ANN model. EMD and EEMD are data- adaptable methods, and thus the number of Intrinsic Mode Functions (IMFs) might differ for different sequences, leading to the discrepancy of the input number for ANN model in training and predicting. Fisher's ordered clustering is thus used to classify the IMFs into a determined number of classes based on their frequency spectrum resulting from Maximum Entropy Spectral Analysis (MESA). The proposed methodology is applied on four important hydrological stations on the upper stream of the Yellow River and the Yangtze River in China, respectively, to forecast the streamflow of the next whole year with the historical daily data of the past 6years. The Nash-Sutcliffe efficiencies of the monthly prediction are higher than 0.85 for all of the four cases, and various indicators indicates that the proposed hybrid method of STL-ANN performs better than other compared methods. The highlights of this study lies in that only historical daily streamflow data is used to derive an accurate long-term prediction by data mining based on decomposition technology and mapping relationships between the decomposed components and the original sequence in the future.","https://doi.org/10.1007/s11269-019-02295-8","10.1007/s11269-019-02295-8","Li, Fang-Fang; Wang, Zhi-Yu; Zhao, Xiao; Xie, En; Qiu, Jun","WATER RESOURCES MANAGEMENT","Long-term prediction; Ensemble empirical mode decomposition (EEMD); Artificial neural network (ANN); Hybrid model; Maximum entropy spectral analysis (MESA)","ARTIFICIAL NEURAL-NETWORKS; EMPIRICAL MODE DECOMPOSITION; STREAMFLOW; RUNOFF; RAINFALL; RIVER; ENSEMBLE; SYSTEM",NA,"SPRINGER","DORDRECHT","VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS","0920-4741","1573-1650",NA,"WATER RESOUR MANAG","Water Resour.

FALSE,551,"Multi-temporal Hydrological Residual Error Modeling for Seamless Subseasonal Streamflow Forecasting","Subseasonal streamflow forecasts, with lead times of 1-30 days, provide valuable information for operational water resource management. This paper introduces the multi-temporal hydrological residual error (MuTHRE) model to address the challenge of obtaining seamless subseasonal forecasts - that is, daily forecasts with consistent high-quality performance over multiple lead times (1-30 days) and aggregation scales (daily to monthly). The key advance of the MuTHRE model is combining the representation of three temporal characteristics of hydrological residual errors: seasonality, dynamic biases, and non-Gaussian errors. The MuTHRE model is applied in 11 Australian catchments using the hydrological model GR4J and post processed rainfall forecasts from the numerical weather prediction model ACCESS-S, and is evaluated against a baseline model that does not model these error characteristics. The MuTHRE model provides high improvements (practically significant in the majority of performance stratifications) in terms of reliability: (i) at short lead times (up to 10 days), due to representing non-Gaussian errors, (ii) stratified by month, due to representing seasonality in hydrological errors, and (iii) in dry years, due to representing dynamic biases in hydrological errors. Forecast performance also improves in terms of sharpness, volumetric bias, and CRPS skill score; these improvements are statistically but not practically significant in the majority of stratifications. Importantly, improvements are consistent across multiple time scales (daily and monthly). This study highlights the benefits of modeling multiple temporal characteristics of hydrological errors and demonstrates the power of the MuTHRE model for producing seamless subseasonal streamflow forecasts that can be utilized for a wide range of applications.","https://doi.org/10.1029/2019WR026979","10.1029/2019WR026979","McInerney, David; Thyer, Mark; Kavetski, Dmitri; Laugesen, Richard; Tuteja, Narendra; Kuczera, George","WATER RESOURCES RESEARCH","subseasonal streamflow forecasts; seamless forecasts; probabilistic forecasts; residual error model; streamflow postprocessing","PARAMETER-ESTIMATION; SERVICE HEFS; ENSEMBLE; PREDICTION; RUNOFF; RANGE; UNCERTAINTY; CALIBRATION; INFERENCE; SKILL",NA,"AMER GEOPHYSICAL UNION","WASHINGTON","2000 FLORIDA AVE NW, WASHINGTON, DC 20009 USA","0043-1397","1944-7973",NA,"WATER RESOUR RES","Water Resour.

TRUE,553,"Selected model fusion: an approach for improving the accuracy of monthly streamflow forecasting","Monthly streamflow forecasting plays an important role in water resources management, especially for dam operation. In this paper, an approach of model fusion technique named selected model fusion (SMF) is applied and assessed under two strategies of model selection in order to improve the accuracy of streamflow forecasting. The two strategies of SMF are: fusion of the outputs of best individual forecasting models (IFMs) selected by dendrogram analysis (S1), and fusion of the best outputs of all IFMs resulting from an ordered selection algorithm (S2). In both strategies, five data-driven models including: artificial neural network, generalized regression neural network, least square-support vector regression, K-nearest neighbor regression, and multiple linear regression with optimized structure are performed as IFMs. The SMF strategies are applied for forecasting the monthly inflow to Karkheh reservoir, Iran, owning various patterns between predictor and predicted variables in different months. Results show that applying SMF approach based on both strategies results in more accurate forecasts in comparison with fusion of all IFMs outputs (S3), as the benchmark. However, comparison of the two SMF strategies reveals that the implementation of strategy (S2) considerably improves the accuracy of forecasts than strategy (S1) as well as the best IFM results (S4) in all months.","https://doi.org/10.2166/hydro.2018.098","10.2166/hydro.2018.098","Modaresi, Fereshteh; Araghinejad, Shahab; Ebrahimi, Kumars","JOURNAL OF HYDROINFORMATICS","Karkheh River; K-nearest neighbor; monthly streamflow forecasting; neural networks; selected model fusion; support vector regression","ARTIFICIAL NEURAL-NETWORK; SUPPORT VECTOR REGRESSION; MULTIMODEL DATA FUSION; PREDICTION; COMBINATION; ENSEMBLES; MACHINES",NA,"IWA PUBLISHING","LONDON","ALLIANCE HOUSE, 12 CAXTON ST, LONDON SW1H0QS, ENGLAND","1464-7141","1465-1734",NA,"J HYDROINFORM","J.

FALSE,554,"Input selection and performance optimization of ANN-based streamflow forecasts in the drought-prone Murray Darling Basin region using IIS and MODWT algorithm","Forecasting streamflow is vital for strategically planning, utilizing and redistributing water resources. In this paper, a wavelet-hybrid artificial neural network (ANN) model integrated with iterative input selection (IIS) algorithm (IIS-W-ANN) is evaluated for its statistical preciseness in forecasting monthly streamflow, and it is then benchmarked against M5 Tree model. To develop hybrid IIS-W-ANN model, a global predictor matrix is constructed for three local hydrological sites (Richmond, Gwydir, and Darling River) in Australia's agricultural (Murray-Darling) Basin. Model inputs comprised of statistically significant lagged combination of streamflow water level, are supplemented by meteorological data (i.e., precipitation, maximum and minimum temperature, mean solar radiation, vapor pressure and evaporation) as the potential model inputs. To establish robust forecasting models, iterative input selection (US) algorithm is applied to screen the best data from the predictor matrix and is integrated with the non-decimated maximum overlap discrete wavelet transform (MODWT) applied on the IIS-selected variables. This resolved the frequencies contained in predictor data while constructing a wavelet-hybrid (i.e., IIS-W-ANN and IIS-W-M5 Tree) model. Forecasting ability of US-W-ANN is evaluated via correlation coefficient (r), Willmott's Index (WI), Nash-Sutcliffe Efficiency (E-NS), root-mean-square-error (RMSE), and mean absolute error (MAE), including the percentage RMSE and MAE. While ANN models are seen to outperform M5 Tree executed for all hydrological sites, the IIS variable selector was efficient in determining the appropriate predictors, as stipulated by the better performance of the IIS coupled (ANN and M5 Tree) models relative to the models without IIS. When IIS-coupled models are integrated with MODWT, the wavelet-hybrid IIS-W-ANN and IIS-W-M5 Tree are seen to attain significantly accurate performance relative to their standalone counterparts. Importantly, IIS-W-ANN model accuracy outweighs IIS-ANN, as evidenced by a larger r and WI (by 7.5% and 3.8%, respectively) and a lower RMSE (by 21.3%). In comparison to the IIS-W-M5 Tree model, IIS-W-ANN model yielded larger values of WI = 0.936-0.979 and E-NS = 0.770-0.920. Correspondingly, the errors (RMSE and MAE) ranged from 0.162-0.487 m and 0.139-0.390 m, respectively, with relative errors, RRMSE = (15.65-21.00) % and MAPE = (14.79-20.78) %. Distinct geographic signature is evident where the most and least accurately forecasted streamflow data is attained for the Gwydir and Darling River, respectively. Conclusively, this study advocates the efficacy of iterative input selection, allowing the proper screening of model predictors, and subsequently, its integration with MODWT resulting in enhanced performance of the models applied in streamflow forecasting.","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.atmosres.2017.06.014","10.1016/j.atmosres.2017.06.014","Prasad, Ramendra; Deo, Ravinesh C.; Li, Yan; Maraseni, Tek","ATMOSPHERIC RESEARCH","Wavelet-hybrid model; Streamflow forecasting; Drought in Murray-Darling Basin; Iterative input selection algorithm, MODWT","SUPPORT VECTOR MACHINE; ARTIFICIAL NEURAL-NETWORK; DISCRETE WAVELET TRANSFORM; GLOBAL SOLAR-RADIATION; M5 MODEL TREES; VARIABLE SELECTION; PARTICLE SWARM; AUSTRALIAN RAINFALL; UPPER REACH; SHORT-TERM",NA,"ELSEVIER SCIENCE INC","NEW YORK","STE 800, 230 PARK AVE, NEW YORK, NY 10169 USA","0169-8095","1873-2895",NA,"ATMOS RES","Atmos.

TRUE,555,"Predicting of daily Khazir basin flow using SWAT and hybrid SWAT-ANN models","Soil and Water Assessment Tool (SWAT) and Artificial Neural Network (ANN) models have been successfully used in streamflow forecasting problems. In this research SWAT model and developed model called (hybrid SWAT-ANN) were applied for forecast daily streamflow for Khazir River at Asmawa and Khanis gauge stations which lies in Kurdistan region in Iraq. In order to calibration and validation of the models, the recorded daily flow which available for twelve years (2004-2015) was divided into two sets. The output of the SWAT model was compared with the recorded data of the streamflow, the residual time series values, which resulted from the comparison, was solved by using the ANN approach. Finally, hydrological model using combined SWAT and ANN tools were obtained, which called hybrid SWAT-ANN model. The root means square error (RMSE) and coefficient of determination (R-2) for Asmawa and Khanis stations using hybrid SWAT-ANN model were found to be more efficient than SWAT model in forecasting the daily streamflow of the basin.

TRUE,556,"Real-time Flood Classification Forecasting Based on k-means plus plus Clustering and Neural Network","Floods are among the most dangerous disasters that affect human beings. Timely and accurate flood forecasting can effectively reduce losses to human life and property and improve the utilization of flood resources. In this study, a real-time flood classification and prediction method (RFC-P) was constructed based on factor analysis, the k-means++ clustering algorithm, SSE, a backpropagation neural network (BPNN) and the M-EIES model. Model parameters of different flood types were obtained to forecast floods. The RFC-P method was applied to the Jingle sub-basin in Shanxi Province. The results showed that the RFC-P method can be used for the real-time classification and prediction of floods. The parameters of the flood classification and prediction model were consistent with the characteristics of the flood events. Compared with the results of unclassified predictions, the Nash coefficient increased by 5%-11.62%, the relative error of the average flood peak was reduced by 6.08%-12.7%, the relative error of the average flood volume was reduced by 5.74%-8.07%, and the time difference of the average peak was reduced by 43%-66% based on the proposed approach. The methodology proposed in this study can be used to identify extreme flood events and provide scientific support for flood classification and prediction, flood control and disaster reduction in river basins, and the efficient utilization of water resources.","https://doi.org/10.1007/s11269-021-03014-y","10.1007/s11269-021-03014-y","Hu Caihong; Zhang Xueli; Li Changqing; Liu Chengshuai; Wang Jinxing; Jian Shengqi","WATER RESOURCES MANAGEMENT","Flood classification forecasting; Real-time classification; k-means plus plus; BPNN","XINANJIANG MODEL; PREDICTION; OPTIMIZATION; CALIBRATION; UNCERTAINTY; ERROR",NA,"SPRINGER","DORDRECHT","VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS","0920-4741","1573-1650",NA,"WATER RESOUR MANAG","Water Resour.

This research aims at developing a hybrid model that integrates the feed-forward neural network (FNN) with a hybrid algorithm of the particle swarm optimization and gravitational search algorithms (PSOGSA) to predict river flow. Fundamentally, as the precision of a FNN model is essentially dependent upon the assurance of its model parameters, this review utilizes the PSOGSA for ideal preparing of the FNN model and gives the likelihood of boosting the execution of FNN. For this purpose, monthly river flow time series from 1990 to 2016 for Garber station of the Turkey River located at Clayton County, Iowa, were used.

TRUE,558,"Regional monthly runoff forecast in southern Canada using ANN, K-means, and L-moments techniques","River runoff forecasting is necessary for numerous applications related to water use, including water supply management, power generation and flooding protection measures. In this study, a regional model using an artificial neural network (ANN) is proposed for monthly runoff forecasting, which considers stations linked to the network that belong to the same homogeneous region, and are delimited using K-means (KM-ANN) and L-moments (LM-ANN) techniques. This methodology was applied to a sample of 90 monthly runoff series in southern Canada. The results were compared to those of a traditional neural network for a given site (ANNs) using statistical indices, such as root-mean-squared error (RMSE), relative square error (RSE), mean absolute error (MAE), relative absolute error (RAE), the concordance index (d) and the coefficient of determination (r(2)). The LM-ANN technique produced better forecasts in 56.7% of the analysed stations, whereas the KM-ANN and ANN techniques produced better forecasts in 27.7% and 15.6% of the stations, respectively. Thus, the results indicate that the regionalisation process improved the forecasts in 84.4% of the studied cases, and the estimation uncertainty was reduced by an average of 31.8%, according to the RMSE, RSE, MAE and RAE values. Therefore, its application is recommended in Canada, where it would be useful for the Integrated Water Resources Management Program.","https://doi.org/10.1080/07011784.2017.1290552","10.1080/07011784.2017.1290552","Escalante-Sandoval, Carlos; Amores-Rovelo, Leonardo","CANADIAN WATER RESOURCES JOURNAL","runoff forecast; regional ANN; homogeneous region; K-means; L-moments","ARTIFICIAL NEURAL-NETWORKS; STREAMFLOW; RIVER; CLASSIFICATION; FLOWS",NA,"TAYLOR & FRANCIS INC","PHILADELPHIA","530 WALNUT STREET, STE 850, PHILADELPHIA, PA 19106 USA","0701-1784","1918-1817",NA,"CAN WATER RESOUR J","Can.

FALSE,559,"A dynamic river network method for the prediction of floods using a parsimonious rainfall-runoff model","Floods are one of the major climate-related hazards and cause casualties and substantial damage. Accurate and timely flood forecasting and design flood estimation are important to protect lives and property. The Distance Distribution Dynamic (DDD) is a parsimonious rainfall-runoff model which is being used for flood forecasting at the Norwegian flood forecasting service. The model, like many other models, underestimates floods in many cases. To improve the flood peak prediction, we propose a dynamic river network method into the model. The method is applied for 15 catchments in Norway and tested on 91 flood peaks. The performance of DDD in terms of KGE and BIAS is identical with and without dynamic river network, but the relative error (RE) and mean absolute relative error (MARE) of the simulated flood peaks are improved significantly with the method. The 0.75 and 0.25 quantiles of the RE are reduced from 41% to 23% and from 22% to 1%, respectively. The MARE is reduced from 32.9% to 15.7%.

FALSE,562,"Complex Assessment and Forecasting of Chemical Pollution of Small Rivers by Economic and Mathematical Modelling Methods","The purpose of this work is to determine the hydrochemical parameters of the water of the river Seret and the features of the accumulation of heavy metals by bivalve molluscs Unio pictorum L. to predict the chemical contamination of the reservoir in the near future. Water samples for the study were taken in spring (April) and summer (July) from the Seret River at two points: above and below Ternopil. It is established that the chemical composition of the water of the river Seret is formed under the influence of a number of factors, but seasonal and anthropogenic factors play a dominant role. In the spring season, a number of hydrochemical indicators (pH, water hardness, concentration of NO2-, NH4+, Cl- ions and metals) have lower values than in the summer. In addition, there is an increase in the amount of organic matter, ammonium cations, nitrite ions, chloride ions, phosphate ions and a decrease in oxygen concentration below Ternopil, especially in the summer season. This is evidence that the Seret River is under significant anthropogenic impact. An increase in the concentration of metals (Mn, Cu and Pb) in summer below Ternopil was revealed, which may be due to the discharge of insufficiently treated wastewater. The series of metal concentrations in the water of the Seret River looks as follows Mn -> Zn -> Pb -> Cd -> Cu, and the series of accumulation of metals in the tissues of molluscs Unio pictorum L. has the form Zn. Mn. Cu. Pb. Cd. On the basis of bioaccumulation coefficients of heavy metals by molluscs, a prediction of the situation on their content in water for the short term based on the theory of Markov chains was made. This theory allows us to make forecasts of a factor, taking into account the possibility of accidental influences on the environment, and to investigate the highest probability of finding a factor in a certain numerical parameter. The possibility of using economic and mathematical modelling tools and statistical methods based on correlation-regression analysis using modern Matlab information systems to identify correlations between chemical indicators of water quality and biological molluscs for modelling the environmental situation of the river Seret and assessing the contribution of the studied indicators in pollution of small rivers is shown.","https://doi.org/10.15421/112142","10.15421/112142","Humeniuk, Halyna B.; Khomenchuk, Volodymyr O.; Harmatiy, Nataliia M.; Chen, Iryna B.","JOURNAL OF GEOLOGY GEOGRAPHY AND GEOECOLOGY","small rivers; heavy metals; bivalve mollusc; prediction of bioaccumulation coefficients of metals; economic and mathematical modelling","ORGANIZATION",NA,"OLES GONCHAR DNIPRO NATL UNIV","DNIPRO","GEOLOGY & GEOGRAPHY DEPT, DMYTRO YAVOMITSKYI, 36, DNIPRO, 49066, UKRAINE","2617-2909","2617-2119",NA,"J GEOL GEOGR GEOECOL","J.
