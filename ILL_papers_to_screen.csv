9,"SWATCH21: A project for linking eco-hydrologic processes and services to aquatic biodiversity at river and catchment levels","The objective of the SWATCH21 project is to improve our understanding of eco-hydrologic services at the catchment level, and biodiversity at the river scale. Six research questions are proposed: (i) How can we improve the access to input data for hydrological and ecological modeling? (ii) What is the role of glacier and snow in modifying the hydrological services? (iii) How can we best assess hydrologic services supplies and demands with the available data and tools? (iv) What will be the impact of the main hydrologic changes on species diversity in rivers? (v) Can we meet the targets of multi-sectorial river-related policies under different climate and landuse forecasting scenarios? (vi) How detailed do ES data and models need to be to answer relevant policy questions? The above questions are tackled through an integrated framework to access, share, process, model, and deliberate on hydrologic ecosystems services. State-of-the-art models have been selected, and will be compared and improved to model different ecosystems and their services. Initial results from a first SWAT model of Switzerland and Species Distribution Models are presented. Expected outputs from various climate and land use change scenarios include rivers' hydrology, predicted biodiversity, and the assessment of ecosystem services in terms of provisioning services (e.g. water resources), regulating services (e.g. nutrient, sediment and flood water retention), and cultural services (e.g. biodiversity, recreation). The expected outcome of the project is to improve integrated evidence-based water policy in the future through the analysis of tradeoffs and synergies between services.

17,"Predicting Lake Quality for the Next Generation: Impacts of Catchment Management and Climatic Factors in a Probabilistic Model Framework","Lake ecosystems across the world are under combined pressures of eutrophication and climate change, which increase the risk of harmful cyanobacteria blooms, reduced ecological status, and degraded ecosystem services. In Europe, the third cycle of river basin management plans (2021-2027) according to the Water Framework Directive must take into account the potential impacts of climate change on water quality, including effects on relevant biological indicators. Here, we applied a Bayesian network as a meta-model for linking future climate and land-use scenarios for the time horizon 2050-2070, via process-based catchment and lake models, to cyanobacteria abundance and ecological status of a eutrophic lake. Building upon previous applications of the model, a new version was developed to include relevant climatic variables such as wind speed. Explorative scenarios showed that the combination of low wind and high temperature gave the most synergistic effects on cyanobacteria under high levels of eutrophication (Chl-a concentration). Considering the management target of good ecological status, however, the climate-related promotion of cyanobacteria blooms contributed most to degrading the ecological status at intermediate levels of eutrophication. Future developments of this model will aim to strengthen the link between climate variables and ecological responses, to make the model also useful for seasonal forecasting.","https://doi.org/10.3390/w11091767","10.3390/w11091767","Moe, S.

31,"Efficient multi-scenario Model Predictive Control for water resources management with ensemble streamflow forecasts","Model Predictive Control (MPC) is one of the most advanced real-time control techniques that has been widely applied to Water Resources Management (WRM). MPC can manage the water system in a holistic manner and has a flexible structure to incorporate specific elements, such as setpoints and constraints. Therefore, MPC has shown its versatile performance in many branches of WRM. Nonetheless, with the in-depth understanding of stochastic hydrology in recent studies, MPC also faces the challenge of how to cope with hydrological uncertainty in its decision-making process. A possible way to embed the uncertainty is to generate an Ensemble Forecast (EF) of hydrological variables, rather than a deterministic one. The combination of MPC and EF results in a more comprehensive approach: Multi-scenario MPC (MS-MPC). In this study, we will first assess the model performance of MS-MPC, considering an ensemble streamflow forecast. Noticeably, the computational inefficiency may be a critical obstacle that hinders applicability of MS-MPC. In fact, with more scenarios taken into account, the computational burden of solving an optimization problem in MS-MPC accordingly increases. To deal with this challenge, we propose the Adaptive Control Resolution (ACR) approach as a computationally efficient scheme to practically reduce the number of control variables in MS-MPC. In brief, the ACR approach uses a mixed-resolution control time step from the near future to the distant future. The ACR-MPC approach is tested on a real-world case study: an integrated flood control and navigation problem in the North Sea Canal of the Netherlands. Such an approach reduces the computation time by 18% and up in our case study. At the same time, the model performance of ACR-MPC remains close to that of conventional MPC. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd.

64,"Evaluating the performances of several artificial intelligence methods in forecasting daily streamflow time series for sustainable water resources management","Accurate runoff forecasting plays an important role in guaranteeing the sustainable utilization and management of water resources. Artificial intelligence methods can provide new possibilities for runoff prediction when the underlying physical relationship cannot be explicitly obtained. However, few reports evaluate the performances of various artificial intelligence methods in forecasting daily streamflow time series for sustainable water resources management by far. To refill this research gap, the potentials of five artificial intelligence methods in daily streamflow series prediction are examined, including artificial neural network (ANN), adaptive neural based fuzzy inference system (ANFIS), extreme learning machine (ELM), Gaussian process regression (GPR) and support vector machine (SVM). Four quantitative statistical indexes are chosen as the evaluation benchmarks. The results from two huge hydropower reservoirs in China show that five artificial intelligence methods can achieve satisfying forecasting results, while the SVM, GPR and ELM methods can produce better performances than ANN and ANFIS in both training and testing phases with respective to four indexes. Thus, it is of great importance to carefully choose the appropriate forecasting models based on the actual characteristics of the studied reservoir.","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.scs.2020.102562","10.1016/j.scs.2020.102562","Niu, Wen-jing; Feng, Zhong-kai","SUSTAINABLE CITIES AND SOCIETY","Runoff time series prediction; Artificial neural network; Adaptive neural-based fuzzy inference system; Extreme learning machine; Support vector machine; Gaussian process regression",NA,NA,"ELSEVIER","AMSTERDAM","RADARWEG 29, 1043 NX AMSTERDAM, NETHERLANDS","2210-6707","2210-6715",NA,"SUSTAIN CITIES SOC","Sust.

80,"Integration of time series forecasting in a dynamic decision support system for multiple reservoir management to conserve water sources","In most of arid and semi-arid regions, there are limited sources of available fresh water for different domestic and environmental demands. Strategic and parsimonious fresh water-use in water-scarce areas such as Southern New Mexico is crucially important. Elephant Butte and Caballo reservoirs are two integrated reservoirs in this region that provide water supply for many water users in downstream areas. Since Elephant Butte Reservoir is in a semi-arid region, it would be rational to utilize other energy sources such as wind energy to produce electricity and use the water supply to other critical demands in terms of time and availability. This study develops a strategy of optimal management of two integrated reservoirs to quantify the savable volume of water sources through optimal operation management. To optimize operations for the Elephant Butte and Caballo reservoirs as an integrated reservoir operation in New Mexico, the authors in this case study utilized two autoregressive integrated moving average models, one non-seasonal (daily, ARIMA model) and one seasonal (monthly, SARIMA model), to predict daily and monthly inflows to the Elephant Butte Reservoir. The coefficient of determination between predicted and observed daily values and the normalized mean of absolute error (NMAE) were 0.97 and 0.09, respectively, indicating that the daily ARIMA prediction model was significantly reliable and accurate for a univariate based streamflow forecast model. The developed time series prediction models were incorporated in a decision support system, which utilizes the predicted values for a day and a month ahead and leads to save significant amount of water volume by providing the optimal release schedule from Elephant Butte into the Caballo Reservoir. The predicted daily and monthly values from the developed ARIMA prediction models were integrated successfully with the dynamic operation model, which provides the optimal operation plans. The optimal operation plan significantly minimizes the total evaporation loss from both reservoirs by providing the optimal storage levels in both reservoirs. The saved volume of the water would be considered as a significant water supply for environmental conservation actions in downstream of the Caballo Reservoir. Providing an integrated optimal management plan for two reservoirs led to save significant water sources in a region that water shortage has led to significant environmental consequences. Finally, since the models are univariate, they demonstrate an approach for reliable inflow prediction when information is limited to only streamflow values. We find that hydroelectric power generation forces the region to lose significant amount of water to evaporation and therefore hinder the optimal use of freshwater. Based on these findings, we conclude that a water scarce region like Southern New Mexico should gain independence from hydroelectric power and save the freshwater for supporting ecosystem services and environmental purposes.","https://doi.org/10.1080/15567036.2018.1476934","10.1080/15567036.2018.1476934","Sabzi, Hamed Zamani; Abudu, Shalamu; Alizadeh, Reza; Soltanisehat, Leili; Dilekli, Naci; King, James Phillip","ENERGY SOURCES PART A-RECOVERY UTILIZATION AND ENVIRONMENTAL EFFECTS","ARIMA; Decision support systems; dynamic systems; reservoir management; sarima; time series analysis","OPTIMIZATION; OPERATION; MODELS; PERFORMANCE; UNCERTAINTY; STREAMFLOW; ENERGY",NA,"TAYLOR & FRANCIS INC","PHILADELPHIA","530 WALNUT STREET, STE 850, PHILADELPHIA, PA 19106 USA","1556-7036","1556-7230",NA,"ENERG SOURCE PART A","Energy Sources Part A-Recovery Util.

144,"Interpretable machine learning to forecast hypoxia in a lagoon","Dissolved oxygen is a key indicator in aquatic ecosystems, reflecting changes in water quality. Low levels of dissolved oxygen may lead to oxygen depletion (called hypoxia), putting at high risk the survival of aquatic organisms. Identifying the environmental conditions inducing hypoxia is therefore a topic of high ecological importance. In this study, we used four machine learning algorithms (Extreme Gradient Boosting (XGBoost), Extremely Randomized Trees (EXT), Random Forest, and Logistic Regression) to forecast hypoxia in a lagoon, considering different time lags (2,5,10 and 20-days). To do so, we used data on dissolved oxygen and a total of nine physicochemical and meteorological variables from Papas lagoon, Greece during 2015-2018. Key drivers and synergies that increase the risk of hypoxia were identified using the Shapley Additive explanations (SHAP) methodology. EXT was slightly superior to the other algorithms in forecasting hypoxia, achieving a success between 89% and 94% with pH, water temperature, chlorophyll and salinity as top explanatory variables. SHAP showed that the synergistic effect of low pH and chlorophyll, and elevated water temperature and salinity tended to favor conditions leading to hypoxia. SHAP also illustrated that diverse synergies of the explanatory variables can induce hypoxia, indicating the complex and nonlinear relationships between environmental factors and hypoxia. Overall, the present approach may be proved useful for the development of a reliable forecasting tool for alarming hypoxia and, ultimately, the effective monitoring of the lagoon.","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ecoinf.2021.101480","10.1016/j.ecoinf.2021.101480","Politikos, Dimitris, V; Petasis, Georgios; Katselis, George","ECOLOGICAL INFORMATICS","Dissolved oxygen; Machine learning; classification; Hypoxia; SHAP; Interpretability","DISSOLVED-OXYGEN; WATER-QUALITY; NEURAL-NETWORK; PAPAS LAGOON; SUMMER; MODEL; REGRESSION; TESTS",NA,"ELSEVIER","AMSTERDAM","RADARWEG 29, 1043 NX AMSTERDAM, NETHERLANDS","1574-9541","1878-0512",NA,"ECOL INFORM","Ecol.

205,"Water quality prediction of salton sea using machine learning and big data techniques","Water accounts for about 70% of the earth's surface and is one of the most important sources of life. The degradation of the Salton Sea's water quality due to excessive usage of fertilisers and pesticides in agriculture has posed serious risks to biodiversity, human health, and the local economy. As a result, it is necessary to establish effective and reliable methodologies for assessing water quality and predicting future trends. This work investigates regression and machine learning models such as linear regression, random forest, support vector machine (SVM) and long short-term memory (LSTM) to predict the salinity level of Salton Sea and forecast future trend. The proposed work studies the Salton Sea water quality and predict certain chemical or physical characteristics such as salinity, pH, and dissolved oxygen. It also finds the correlation between water indexes and environmental indexes surrounding the Salton Sea. The findings of this study can assist policymakers in determining the salinity of water and devising policies to minimise salt levels in order to manage freshwater for long-term development. While evaluating experiments, it has been found that the machine learning methodology is more flexible and accurate than traditional statistical methods, and that it aids in achieving better results.","https://doi.org/10.1080/03067319.2021.1963713","10.1080/03067319.2021.1963713","Chawla, Priyanka; Cao, Xiyu; Fu, Yichen; Hu, Ching-min; Wang, Meng; Wang, Shenquan; Gao, Jerry Zeyu","INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL ANALYTICAL CHEMISTRY","Machine learning; water quality; SVM; LSTM",NA,NA,"TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD","ABINGDON","2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OR14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND","0306-7319","1029-0397",NA,"INT J ENVIRON AN CH","Int.

240,"Forecasting reservoir monthly runoff via ensemble empirical mode decomposition and extreme learning machine optimized by an improved gravitational search algorithm","Monthly streamflow prediction plays a significant role in reservoir operation and water resource management. Hence, this research tries to develop a hybrid model for accurate monthly streamflow prediction, where the ensemble empirical mode decomposition (EEMD) is firstly used to decompose the original streamflow data into a finite amount of intrinsic mode functions (IMFs) and a residue; and then the extreme learning machine (ELM) is employed to forecast each IMFs and the residue, while an improved gravitational search algorithm (IGSA) based on elitist-guide evolution strategies, selection operator and mutation operator is used to select the parameters of all the ELM models; finally, the summarized predicated results for all the subcomponents are treated as the final forecasting result. The hybrid method is applied to forecast the monthly runoff of Three Gorges in China, while four quantitative indexes are used to test the performances of the developed forecasting models. The results show that EEMD can effectively separate the internal characteristics of the original monthly runoff, and the hybrid model is able to make an obvious improvement over other models in hydrological time series prediction.

266,"Development of a method for comprehensive water quality forecasting and its application in Miyun reservoir of Beijing, China","Water quality forecasting is an essential part of water resourcemanagement. Spatiotemporal variations of water quality and their inherent constraints make it very complex. This study explored a data-based method for short-term water quality forecasting.

325,"Application of static and dynamic artificial neural networks for forecasting inflow discharges, case study: Sefidroud Dam reservoir","Accurate forecasting of reservoir inflow is of great importance in water resources planning and management and it can highly affect decisions and policies of reservoir operation with respect to flood control, drought management, water supply, and hydropower generation. In this study, different models of static and dynamic artificial neural networks (ANN) including static feed forward neural network (FFNN), nonlinear autoregressive (NAR), and nonlinear autoregressive with exogenous inputs (NARX) are employed in order to forecast Sefidroud Dam reservoir inflows. The capability of studied networks with a range of different input variables in predicting reservoir inflows are then compared. All employed models are trained using inflow discharge and precipitation data with different time delays and an optimum number of neurons in the hidden layers are obtained. In addition, the time index (T) is also employed as the input data to the proposed models in order to increase the accuracy of the estimates. The obtained results indicate that NAR dynamic neural network has a better performance in comparison with FFNN and NARX models. Furthermore, using 12 time delays for inflow discharges and precipitation data leads to the best accessible results where adding time index (T) increases the accuracy. The results obtained from this study provide useful information for reservoir inflow simulation. In other words, these results are critical for water resources management and planning particularly in the field of dam reservoir operation which is crucial under reported water crisis in Iran.

329,"Multivariate remotely sensed and in-situ data assimilation for enhancing community WRF-Hydro model forecasting","Flood is one of the most catastrophic natural disasters in the United States, particularly in the Southeast states where hurricanes and tropical storms are most prevalent, causing billions of dollars in damage annually and significant losses of life and property. The Weather Research and Forecasting Hydrological model (WRF-Hydro) is a community-based hydrologic model designed to improve the skill of hydrometeorological forecasts, such as river discharge, through simulating hydrologic prognostic (e.g., soil moisture) and diagnostic (e.g., energy fluxes) variables. These quantities are potentially biased or erroneous due to the uncertainties involved in all layers of hydrologic predictions. In this study, we use an ensemble based Data Assimilation (DA) approach to explore the benefit of independently and jointly assimilating remotely sensed SMAP (Soil Moisture Active Passive) soil moisture (at different spatial resolutions) and USGS streamflow observations to improve the accuracy and reliability of WRF-Hydro model predictions while accounting for uncertainties. This study is conducted over a large region near to Houston, Texas where heavy rainfall from hurricane Harvey caused flooding in 2017. Before implementing DA, we first calibrated the WRF-Hydro model parameters using four United States Geological Survey (USGS) stream gauges installed within the watershed. In this step, we identified the most dominant model parameters, which were used later in the development of joint state-parameter DA. The findings of this study showed that the multivariate assimilation of soil moisture and streamflow observations results in improved prediction of stream flow as compared to univariate assimilation configurations and regardless of the watershed's streamflow regime. The results also revealed that, during the normal streamflow condition, assimilation of downscaled SMAP soil moisture at 1 km spatial resolution, would improve the accuracy of streamflow simulation more than the assimilation of coarse resolution products (i.e., the native SMAP at 36 km spatial resolution and its interpolated version at 9 km spatial resolution). However, during the period of hurricane Harvey, the soil moisture observations at different resolutions showed a similar impact on improving the streamflow prediction.","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.advwatres.2020.103721","10.1016/j.advwatres.2020.103721","Abbaszadeh, Peyman; Gavahi, Keyhan; Moradkhani, Hamid","ADVANCES IN WATER RESOURCES","Flood prediction; WRF-Hydro; Data assimilation; SMAP soil moisture","SOIL-MOISTURE PRODUCT; ENSEMBLE KALMAN FILTER; PARTICLE FILTER; CLIMATE-CHANGE; SEQUENTIAL ASSIMILATION; EXTREME RAINFALL; STREAMFLOW; CALIBRATION; EVAPOTRANSPIRATION; UNCERTAINTY",NA,"ELSEVIER SCI LTD","OXFORD","THE BOULEVARD, LANGFORD LANE, KIDLINGTON, OXFORD OX5 1GB, OXON, ENGLAND","0309-1708","1872-9657",NA,"ADV WATER RESOUR","Adv.

The groundwater resource system is influenced by multiple factors such as temperature, precipitation, evapotranspiration, surface water recharge and groundwater discharge, it is characterized by randomness and non-stationary. The empirical mode decomposition (EMD) can decompose the signal into sub-signals of different frequencies and can reduce the non-stationary of the original signal, the Elman neural network (ENN) has strong nonlinear approximation ability. Based on the characteristics of the above two methods, the EMD-Elman coupling forecasting model was constructed and applied to groundwater depth forecasting in People's Victory Canal Irrigation District. The results show that EMD-Elman model has better forecasting effect and lower forecasting error and is better than single back propagation neural network model and ENN model. Furthermore, under human over-exploitation, the forecasting accuracy of the EMD-Elman model will be slightly reduced, but the forecasting effect is still in the acceptable range.

655,"A comprehensive comparison of recent developed meta-heuristic algorithms for streamflow time series forecasting problem","Hydrological models play a crucial role in water planning and decision making. Machine Learning-based models showed several drawbacks for frequent high and a wide range of streamflow records. These models also experience problems during the training process such as over-fitting or trapping in searching for global optima To overcome these limitations, the current study attempts to hybridize the recently developed physics-inspired metaheuristic algorithms (MHAs) such as Equilibrium Optimization (EO), Henry Gases Solubility Optimization (HGSO), and Nuclear Reaction Optimization(NRO) with Multi-layer Perceptron (MLP). These models' accuracy will be inspected to solve the streamflow forecasting problem where the streamflow dataset was collected through 130 years from a station located on the High Aswan Dam (HAD). The performance of proposed models then will be compared with two traditional neural network models(MLP and RNN), and nine well-known hybrid MLP-based models belong to the different branches of the metaheuristic field (evolutionary group, swarm group, and physics group). The internal parameters of the proposed models will be initialized and optimized. Different performance metrics will be used to examine the performance of the proposed models. The stability of the proposed models and the convergence speed will be evaluated. Finally, ranking these models based on different performance evaluations will be carried out. The results show that the models in the group of Physics-MLP are more reliable in capturing the streamflow patterns, followed by the Swarm-MLP group and then by the Evolutionary-MLP group. Finally, among the all employed methods, the NRO has the best accuracy with the lowest RMSE(2.35), MAE(1.356), MAPE(16.747), and the highest WI(0.957), R(0.924), and confidence in forecasting the streamflow of Aswan High Dam. It can be concluded that augmenting the NRO algorithm with MLP can be a reliable tool in forecasting the monthly streamflow with a high level of precision, speed convergence, and high constancy level.

The area of small and medium-sized river basins is relatively small. Precipitation, soil moisture, evaporation and other factors can affect the timely total runoff prediction. However, not all the hydrological features is always valuable for flood forecasting, even at some time, noise of the factors will have larger interference on forecast process. Therefore, dynamic extraction of key feature vectors from various hydrological information plays an important role in flood forecasting. This paper proposed a flood forecasting model (STA-LSTM model) by using long short-term memory model (LSTM) and attention mechanism. We take the Lech river basin in Europe as the experimental basin and the results show that STA-LSTM performs well and has high research value with comparison of support vector machine (SVM),fully connected network (FCN) and original LSTM.","https://doi.org/10.1109/iThings/GreenCom/CPSCom/SmartData.2019.00095","10.1109/iThings/GreenCom/CPSCom/SmartData.2019.00095","Ding, Yukai; Zhu, Yuelong; Wu, Yirui; Feng, Jun; Cheng, Zirun","2019 INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE ON INTERNET OF THINGS (ITHINGS) AND IEEE GREEN COMPUTING AND COMMUNICATIONS (GREENCOM) AND IEEE CYBER, PHYSICAL AND SOCIAL COMPUTING (CPSCOM) AND IEEE SMART DATA (SMARTDATA)","flood forecasting; neural network; LSTM; spatio-temporal model; attention mechanism","THRESHOLDS",NA,"IEEE","NEW YORK","345 E 47TH ST, NEW YORK, NY 10017 USA",NA,NA,"978-1-7281-2980-8",NA,NA,NA,2019,NA,NA,"458","465",NA,NA
679,"Measuring the skill of an operational ice jam flood forecasting system","Though mitigation measures and research have increased over the last few decades, ice jams and associated flooding continue to be one of the most underestimated disasters in many northern countries. Operational ice jam flood forecasting systems are becoming one of the more prominent tools used in mitigating ice-related flood risk within Canada. Several forecasting systems have been adopted across the country and forecasters are constantly looking to improve the accuracy and consistency of their systems. The Lower Red River in Manitoba has been the subject in discussion of many ice jam related studies, and a data-driven ice-jam hazard forecasting system is currently in use at this site. This system differs from hydrologic model driven forecasting systems used for other ice jam prone rivers across Canada. This study focuses on identifying the methodology of the data driven ice jam flood forecasting system, along with the methodology of the forecasting procedures. Furthermore, the effectiveness of the data driven forecasting system is measured and assessed for the Lower Red River's 2020 breakup season.","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ijdrr.2020.102001","10.1016/j.ijdrr.2020.102001","Williams, Brandon S.; Das, Apurba; Johnston, Peter; Luo, Bin; Lindenschmidt, Karl-Erich","INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF DISASTER RISK REDUCTION","Ice jam; Operational flood forecasting; Data-driven model; Stochastic modelling; Red river","MANAGEMENT; FREQUENCY; BREAKUP; CANADA",NA,"ELSEVIER","AMSTERDAM","RADARWEG 29, 1043 NX AMSTERDAM, NETHERLANDS","2212-4209",NA,NA,"INT J DISAST RISK RE","Int.

706,"Hybrid artificial neural network and cooperation search algorithm for nonlinear river flow time series forecasting in humid and semi-humid regions","Accurate river flow forecasting is of great importance for the scientific management of water resources system. With the advantages of easy implementation and high flexibility, artificial neural network (ANN) has been widely employed to address the complex hydrological forecasting problem. However, the conventional ANN method often suffers from some defects in practice, like slow convergence and local minimum. In order to enhance the ANN performance, this study proposes a hybrid river flow forecasting method by integrating the novel cooperation search algorithm (CSA) into the learning process of ANN. In other words, the computational parameters of the ANN network (like threshold and linking weights) are iteratively optimized by the CSA method in the feasible state space. The proposed method is applied to the river flow data collected from two real-world hydrological stations in China. Several Quantitative indexes are chosen to compare the performance of the developed models, while the comprehensive analysis between the simulated and observed flow data are conducted. The experimental results show that in different scenarios, the hybrid method based on ANN and CSA always outperforms the control models and yields superior forecasting results during both training and testing phases. In Three Gorges Project, the presented method makes 11.10% and 5.42% improvements in the Nash-Sutcliffe efficiency and Coefficient correlation values of the standard ANN method in the testing phase. Thus, this interesting finding shows that the performance of the artificial intelligence models in river flow time series forecasting can be effectively improved by metaheuristic algorithm with outstanding global search ability.
